    "title": "(Almost) Model-Free Recovery",
    "abstract": "Under mild assumptions, we recover the model-free conditional minimum variance projection of the pricing kernel on various tradeable realized moments of market returns. Recovered conditional moments predict future realizations and give insight into the cyclicality of equity premia, variance risk premia, and the highest attainable Sharpe ratios under the minimum variance probability. The pricing kernel projections are often U-shaped and give rise to optimal conditional portfolio strategies with plausible market timing properties, moderate countercyclical exposures to higher realized moments, and favorable out-of-sample Sharpe ratios. A Seminal Finding IN Breeden and Litzenberger (1978) shows that the condi- tional forward-neutral distribution of an asset return in arbitrage-free option markets is uniquely identiﬁed by the second derivative of the European call price function with respect to the option’s strike. No corresponding model-free result is available for the conditional distribution of returns under the physical belief. Recent model-based recovery theorems study conditions on physical tran- sition dynamics and pricing kernels under which the physical belief can be determined from Arrow-Debreu prices alone. Broadly speaking, this literature shows that recovery is possible whenever physical probabilities are induced by a family of path-independent pricing kernels and satisfy further stability conditions.1 Path-independence is essential for these theorems, as, in general,",

    "abstract": "We reconsider trend-based predictability by employing ﬂexible learning methods to identify price patterns that are highly predictive of returns, as opposed to testing predeﬁned patterns like momentum or reversal. Our predictor data are stock-level price charts, allowing us to extract the most predictive price patterns using machine learning image analysis techniques. These patterns differ signiﬁcantly from com- monly analyzed trend signals, yield more accurate return predictions, enable more proﬁtable investment strategies, and demonstrate robustness across speciﬁcations. Remarkably, they exhibit context independence, as short-term patterns perform well on longer time scales, and patterns learned from U.S. Stocks prove effective in inter- national markets. Nevertheless, technical analysis has survived through the years, perhaps because its visual mode of analysis is more conducive to human cognition, and because pattern recognition is one of the few repetitive activities for which computers do not have an absolute advantage (yet) .

    "abstract": "We placed 85,000 retail trades in six retail brokerage accounts from December 2021 to June 2022 to validate the Boehmer et al. Algorithm, which uses subpenny trade prices to identify and sign retail trades. The algorithm identiﬁes 35% of our trades as retail, incorrectly signs 28% of identiﬁed trades, and yields uninformative order imbalance measures for 30% of stocks. We modify the algorithm by signing trades using the quoted spread midpoints. The quote midpoint method does not affect iden- tiﬁcation rates but reduces the signing error rates to 5% and provides informative order imbalance measures for all stocks. Boehmer ET AL .( 2021, Bjzz), Propose AN Algorithm that identiﬁes as retail trades those that are executed off exchanges, typically by wholesalers such as Citadel or Virtu, and receive subpenny price improvement. The key idea relies on Regulation NMS (National Market System), adopted in 2005 by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Rule 612 prohibits the dis- play of quotes with decimals below one cent (the “subpenny” rule) while still allowing execution at prices with fractional cents.

    "title": "A Bayesian Approach to Real Options: The Case",
    "abstract": "Traditional real options models demonstrate the importance of the “option to wait” due to uncertainty over future shocks to project cash ﬂows. However, there is often another important source of uncertainty: uncertainty over the permanence of past shocks. Adding Bayesian uncertainty over the permanence of past shocks augments the traditional option to wait with an additional “option to learn.” The implied in- vestment behavior differs signiﬁcantly from that in standard models. For example, investment may occur at a time of stable or decreasing cash ﬂows, respond sluggishly to cash ﬂow shocks, and depend on the timing of project cash ﬂows. During THE Past TWO Decades the real options approach to valuation of irre- versible investment opportunities has become part of the mainstream litera- ture in ﬁnancial economics. The central idea is that the opportunity to invest is equivalent to an American call option on the underlying investment project. As a consequence, the problem of optimal investment timing is analogous to the optimal exercise decision for an American option. Applications of the real options approach are now numerous. One feature that is common to virtually all real options models is that the underlying uncertainty pertains only to future shocks. Since future cash ﬂows are uncertain, there is an important opportunity cost of investing today: the value of the asset might go up so that tomorrow will be an even better time to invest. This opportunity cost is often refe",

    "abstract": "The acceleration of the U.S. Productivity growth in the late 1990s suggests a significant advance in technological innovation, making the perceived probability of entering a “new economy” ever increasing. Based on macroeconomic data, we identify a Bayesian investor’s belief evolution when facing a possible structural break in the economy. We show that such belief evolution plays a significant role in explaining both the stock market boom and crash during 1998 to 2001. We conclude that a rational investor’s uncertainty about the future of the U.S. Economy provides an alternative explanation for the late 1990s stock market “bubble.” In the past five years or so,...one [new trend] has been the serendipitous emergence of a once- or twice-in-a-century surge in technology ...nearly everyone perceives that the resulting more rapid growth of labor produc- tivity is at least partly enduring....

    "title": "A Catering Theory of Dividends",
    "abstract": "We propose that the decision to pay dividends is driven by prevailing investor demand for dividend payers. Managers cater to investors by paying dividends when investors put a stock price premium on payers, and by not paying when investors prefer nonpay- ers. To test this prediction, we construct four stock price-based measures of investor demand for dividend payers. By each measure, nonpayers tend to initiate dividends when demand is high. By some measures, payers tend to omit dividends when demand is low. Further analysis confirms that these results are better explained by catering than other theories of dividends. Miller AND Modigiliani (1961) prove that dividend policy is irrelevant to share value in perfect and efficient capital markets. In that setup, no rational investor has a preference between dividends and capital gains. Arbitrage ensures that dividend policy is irrelevant. Forty-plus years later, the only assumption in this proof that has not been thoroughly scrutinized is market efficiency. 1 In this paper, we argue for a view of dividends that relaxes this assumption. It has three basic ingredients. First, for either psychological or institutional reasons, some investors have an unin- formed and perhaps time-varying demand for dividend-paying stocks. Second, arbitrage fails to prevent this demand from driving apart the prices of payers and nonpayers. Third, managers rationallycater to investor demand—they pay dividends when investors put higher prices on payers,",

    "title": "A Comparative-Advantage Approach",
    "abstract": "We study optimal government debt maturity in a model where investors derive mon- etary services from holding riskless short-term securities. In a setting where the government is the only issuer of such riskless paper, it trades off the monetary pre- mium associated with short-term debt against the reﬁnancing risk implied by the need to roll over its debt more often. We extend the model to allow private ﬁnan- cial intermediaries to compete with the government in the provision of short-term money-like claims. We argue that, if there are negative externalities associated with private money creation, the government should tilt its issuance more toward short maturities, thereby partially crowding out the private sector’s use of short-term debt. IN This Paper, we study how the government should optimally determine the maturity structure of its debt. We focus on situations in which there is no ques- tion about the government’s ability to service its obligations, so the analysis should be thought of as applying to countries like the United States that are of exceptionally high credit quality.1 The primary novelty of our approach is that we emphasize the monetary beneﬁts that investors derive from holding risk- less short-term securities, such as Treasury bills. These beneﬁts lead T-bills to embed a convenience premium, that is, to have a lower yield than would be expected from a traditional asset pricing model.

    "title": "A Comparison of Centralized and Fragmented",
    "abstract": "How does quotation transparency affect financial market performance? Biais’s irrel- evance proposition in 1993 shows that centralized markets yield the same expected bid–ask spreads as fragmented markets, other things equal. However, de Frutos and Manzano demonstrated in 2002 that expected spreads in fragmented markets are smaller and market participants prefer to trade in fragmented markets. This paper introduces liquidity traders’ costs of searching for a better quote into the Biais model and derives opposite conclusions to these previous studies: expected spreads in cen- tralized markets are smaller and liquidity traders prefer centralized markets, while market makers prefer fragmented markets. THE Trading Mechanism OF A Market is pivotal to its performance. Biais (1993) groups securities markets into two categories according to their trading fea- tures. “Telephone dealer markets such as Nasdaq, Seaq, the foreign ex- change market, and the Treasury bonds market are fragmented” because “deals are the outcome of bilateral negotiations that other market participants can- not observe” (page 157). On the other hand, the markets of “the stock and future exchanges, such as the Nyse or the Cbot” are centralized since “all the orders are addressed to the same location so that market participants can observe all the quotes and trades and take them into account in their strategies” (page 157). The core of this market classification is the transparency of mar- kets. Centralized market",

    "title": "A Consumption-Based Explanation of Expected",
    "abstract": "When utility is nonseparable in nondurable and durable consumption and the elastic- ity of substitution between the two consumption goods is sufficiently high, marginal utility rises when durable consumption falls. The model explains both the cross- sectional variation in expected stock returns and the time variation in the equity pre- mium. Small stocks and value stocks deliver relatively low returns during recessions, when durable consumption falls, which explains their high average returns relative to big stocks and growth stocks. Stock returns are unexpectedly low at business cycle troughs, when durable consumption falls sharply, which explains the countercyclical variation in the equity premium. Explaining THE Variation IN Expected Returns across stocks and the variation in the equity premium over time as trade-offs between risk and return is a challenge for financial economists. In his review article on market efficiency, Fama (1991, p. 1610) concludes In the end, I think we can hope for a coherent story that (1) relates the cross-section properties of expected returns to the variation of expected returns through time, and (2) relates the behavior of expected returns to the real economy in a rather detailed way. Or we can hope to convince ourselves that no such story is possible. This paper proposes a “coherent story” that satisfies both criteria.

    "title": "A Crisis of Banks as Liquidity Providers",
    "abstract": "Can banks maintain their advantage as liquidity providers when exposed to a ﬁnan- cial crisis? While banks honored credit lines drawn by ﬁrms during the 2007 to 2009 crisis, this liquidity provision was only possible because of explicit, large support from the government and government-sponsored agencies. At the onset of the crisis, aggre- gate deposit inﬂows into banks weakened and their loan-to-deposit shortfalls widened. These patterns were pronounced at banks with greater undrawn commitments. Such banks sought to attract deposits by offering higher rates, but the resulting private funding was insufﬁcient to cover shortfalls and they reduced new credit. This Paper Investigates WHETHERthe onset of the 2007 to 2009 crisis was, in effect, a crisis of banks as liquidity providers, which increased the fragility of the ﬁnancial system. The starting point of our analysis is the widely accepted notion that banks have a natural advantage in providing liquidity to businesses through credit lines and other commitments established during normal times. Even though banks experience signiﬁcant and synchronized drawdowns during episodes of market stress, it is argued that they have no difﬁculty meeting these increased credit demands (e.g., Gatev and Strahan (2006)). The reason is that banks are awash with funds from depositors seeking a safe haven due to both deposit insurance as well as the regular occurrence of crises outside the banking system (e.g., the autumn of 1998 following the Ru",

    "title": "A Dynamic Model of Characteristic-Based",
    "abstract": "We present a dynamic model that links characteristic-based return predictability to systematic factors that determine the evolution of ﬁrm fundamentals. In the model, an economy-wide disruption process reallocates proﬁts from existing businesses to new projects and thus generates a source of systematic risk for portfolios of ﬁrms sorted on value, proﬁtability, and asset growth. If investors are overconﬁdent about their ability to evaluate the disruption climate, these characteristic-sorted portfolios exhibit persistent mispricing. The model generates predictions about the conditional predictability of characteristic-sorted portfolio returns and illustrates how return persistence increases the likelihood of observing characteristic-based anomalies. Since THE Late 1970S, Financial economists have identiﬁed a number of ﬁrm characteristics like valuation ratios, proﬁtability, and asset growth rates that explain the cross-section of stock returns. Historically, market-neutral portfo- lios that are sorted on these characteristics have exhibited very high Sharpe ratios—at least as high as the Sharpe ratio of the market. Although the litera- ture has mostly focused on these historical return patterns, there is relatively returns. This is somewhat surprising because the cross-section of ﬁrm char- acteristics in the economy, as well as the relation between characteristics and ﬁrm values, exhibits substantial time variation (e.g., the increased prevalence and valuations of growth ﬁrms i",

    "abstract": "Borrowing from multiple creditors exposes ﬁrms to rollover risk due to coordination problems among creditors, but it also improves ﬁrms’ repayment incentives, thereby increasing pledgeability . Based on this trade-off, I develop a dynamic debt rollover model to analyze the evolution of creditor dispersion. Consistent with empirical evi- dence, I ﬁnd that ﬁrms optimally increase creditor dispersion after poor performance. In contrast, cross-sectionally higher-growth ﬁrms can support more dispersed cred- itors. Frequent debt renegotiation limits ﬁrms’ ability to increase pledgeability by having more creditors. Finally , holding a cash balance while borrowing from multiple creditors improves ﬁrms’ repayment incentives uniformly across all future states. Many Firms Borrow From Multiple creditors.1 Having more creditors risks coordination problems among them, making it more difﬁcult for ﬁrms to restructure their debt.

    "title": "A Gap-Filling Theory of Corporate Debt",
    "abstract": "We argue that time variation in the maturity of corporate debt arises because ﬁrms behave as macro liquidity providers, absorbing the supply shocks associated with changes in the maturity structure of government debt. We document that when the government funds itself with more short-term debt, ﬁrms ﬁll the resulting gap by issuing more long-term debt, and vice versa. This type of liquidity provision is under- taken more aggressively: (1) when the ratio of government debt to total debt is higher and (2) by ﬁrms with stronger balance sheets. Our theory sheds new light on market timing phenomena in corporate ﬁnance more generally. There IS Substantial year-to-year variation in the average maturity of cor- porate debt issues. For example, usingFlow of Fundsdata from the Federal Reserve, which cover all forms of borrowing, including both public and private, we estimate that in 1999, 24.7% of nonﬁnancial corporate debt issues were “long term”—deﬁned as having a maturity of 1 year or more. This long-term share fell sharply to 19.9% in 2000, and then bounced back to a new peak of 30.1% in 2001. What accounts for these movements? There are a number of prominent the- ories of debt maturity choice, but the majority of these theories focus on ﬁrm- level determinants and hence do not have clear-cut implications for aggregate time-series behavior. One familiar idea is that ﬁrms should attempt to match the maturities of their assets and liabilities (e.g., Myers (1977), Hart and Moore (1995)",

    "abstract": "This paper derives preference-free option pricing equations in a discrete time economy where asset returns have continuous distributions. There is a repre- sentative agent who has risk preferences with an exponential representation. Aggregate wealth and the underlying asset price have transformed normal distributions which may or may not belong to the same family of distributions. Those pricing results are particularly valuable (a) to show new sufficient con- ditions for existing risk-neutral option pricing equations (e.g., the Black- Scholes model), and (b) to obtain new analytical solutions for the price of Eur- opean-style contingent claims when the underlying asset has a transformed normal distribution (e.g., a negatively skew lognormal distribution). A Fundamental Result in the valuation theory under uncertainty is that equili- brium asset prices depend on investors' marginal utility functions. In this frame- work, assuming a discrete time trading model and asset returns with continuous distributions, Rubinstein (1976) and Brennan (1979) are able to derive risk-neu- tral valuation relations. That is, preference-free option pricing equations with an implicit mean return equal to the interest rate. These pricing results seem surprising, but they simply explore the relationship between derivatives and their underlying asset. The underlying asset has an absolute price and derivatives have relative prices in terms of the underlying asset price, implying that, in equi- librium",

We motivate our decomposition with a model featuring horizon-speciﬁc investment ideas, where short-term ideas are less scalable because the associated trades cannot be spread over time. Fund turnover correlates negatively with the horizon over which value is added and positively with price impact costs. As predicted, holdings of high-turnover funds add a substantial amount of value in the ﬁrst two weeks, of which more than 80% is earned on Federal Open Market Commit- tee (fomc) and earnings announcement days. Holdings of low-turnover funds add value only over longer horizons. THE Objective OF Active Mutual funds is to ﬁnd investments that add value over and above their investors’ alternative investment opportunity set. How funds achieve this objective exhibits large cross-sectional variation in the data, particularly when it comes to the average holding period of such invest- ments.

    "abstract": "We show that labor search frictions are an important determinant of the cross-section of equity returns. Empirically, we ﬁnd that ﬁrms with low loadings on labor market tightness outperform ﬁrms with high loadings by 6% annually. We propose a partial equilibrium labor market model in which heterogeneous ﬁrms make dynamic employ- ment decisions under labor search frictions. In the model, loadings on labor market tightness proxy for priced time-variation in the efﬁciency of the aggregate matching technology. Firms with low loadings are more exposed to adverse matching efﬁciency shocks and require higher expected stock returns. Dynamics IN THE Labor Market are an integral component of business cycles.

These large ﬂows are costly for ﬁrms, because they need to spend resources to search for and train new employees.1 Building on the seminal contributions of Diamond (1982), Mortensen (1982), and Pissarides (1985), we show that labor search frictions are an important Singleton, two anonymous referees, Frederico Belo, Ilan Cooper, Andres Donangelo, Vito Gala, Brent Glover, Bart Hobijn, Burton Holliﬁeld, Finn Kydland, Christian Lundblad, Stefan Nagel, Stavros Panageas, Dimitris Papanikolaou, Nicolas Petrosky-Nadeau, Chris Telmer, Lu Zhang, con- ference participants of the 2012 Western Economic Assoc",

    "title": "A Lintner Model of Payout and Managerial Rents",
    "abstract": "We develop a dynamic agency model in which payout, investment, and ﬁnancing decisions are made by managers who attempt to maximize the rents they take from the ﬁrm, subject to a capital market constraint. Managers smooth payout to smooth their ﬂow of rents.Total payout (dividends plus net repurchases) follows Lintner’s (1956) target adjustment model. Payout smooths out transitory shocks to current income and adjusts gradually to changes inpermanent income. Smoothing is accomplished by borrowing or lending. Payout is not cut back to ﬁnance capital investment. Risk aversion causes managers to underinvest, but habit formation mitigates the degree of underinvestment. This Paper Presents A Theory OF Payout by mature public corporations in a dynamic agency setting. The theory says that payout follows Lintner’s(1956) target adjustment model. If payout is restricted to cash dividends, Lintner’s model is /Delta1Dividendt = κ + SOA ( Target Dividendt − Dividendt−1 ) + et, (1) where /Delta1Dividendt is the change from the previous dividend at periodt − 1, SOA < 1 is the speed of adjustment,κ is a constant, andet is an error term. The target dividend is the product of a target payout ratio and net income at t. The target payout ratio and the coefﬁcientsκ and SOA are assumed to be constant over time, although they can vary across ﬁrms. Thus, dividends are based on current net income, but smoothed. Lintner did not derive his model. He came to it inductively, based on inter- views with 28 l",

    "title": "A Macroﬁnance View of U.S. Sovereign",
    "abstract": "Premiums on U.S. Sovereign credit default swaps (CDS) have risen to persistently elevated levels since the ﬁnancial crisis. We examine whether these premiums reﬂect the probability of a ﬁscal default—a state in which a balanced budget can no longer be restored by raising taxes or eroding the real value of debt by increasing inﬂation. We develop an equilibrium macroﬁnance model in which the ﬁscal and monetary policy stances jointly endogenously determine nominal debt, taxes, inﬂation, and growth. We show that the CDS premiums reﬂect the endogenous risk-adjusted probabilities of ﬁscal default. The calibrated model is consistent with elevated levels of CDS pre- miums but leaves dynamic implications quantitatively unresolved. THE 2008 Credit Crisis brought about signiﬁcant changes in the markets for sovereign credit default swaps (CDS) of economically developed countries. The near-zero trading volumes at near-zero premiums observed in late 2007 expanded to active trading at substantial premiums of hundreds of basis points (bps). Although the crisis eventually subsided, premiums on sovereign CDS remain elevated and are nowhere close to precrisis levels. In this paper, we seek to determine the risks that are so richly compensated in these markets. The answer may seem obvious given that CDS are designed to insure against default.

This description is useful when returns are not indepen- dent over time and investors have nonmarketed income. Investors hedge their outside income streams. Then, their optimal payoff is split between an indexed perpetuity— the risk-free payoff—and a long-run mean-variance efﬁcient payoff. “Long-run” mo- ments sum over time as well as states of nature. In equilibrium, long-run expected returns vary with long-run market betas and outside-income betas. State-variable hedges do not appear.

I allow asset return dynamics, dynamic trading, nonmarket wealth, such as wages, businesses, or real estate, and preference shocks.

    "abstract": "We analyze how institutional investors entering commodity futures markets, referred to as the ﬁnancialization of commodities, affect commodity prices. Institutional in- vestors care about their performance relative to a commodity index. We ﬁnd that all commodity futures prices, volatilities, and correlations go up with ﬁnancialization, but more so for index futures than for nonindex futures. The equity-commodity cor- relations also increase. We demonstrate how ﬁnancial markets transmit shocks not only to futures prices but also to commodity spot prices and inventories. Spot prices go up with ﬁnancialization, and shocks to any index commodity spill over to all storable commodity prices. A Sharp Increase IN THE Popularity of commodity investing over the past decade has triggered an unprecedented inﬂow of institutional funds into com- modity futures markets, referred to as the ﬁnancialization of commodities. At the same time, the behavior of commodity prices has become highly un- usual. Commodity prices have experienced signiﬁcant run-ups, and the na- ture of their ﬂuctuations has changed considerably. An emerging literature on the ﬁnancialization of commodities attributes this behavior to the emergence of commodities as an asset class, which has become widely held by institu- tional investors seeking diversiﬁcation beneﬁts (Buyuksahin and Robe (2014), Singleton (2014)). Starting in 2004, institutional investors have been rapidly building their positions in commodity futures.1 A",

    "title": "A Model of Monetary Policy and Risk Premia",
    "abstract": "We develop a dynamic asset pricing model in which monetary policy affects the risk premium component of the cost of capital. Risk-tolerant agents (banks) borrow from risk-averse agents (i.e., take deposits) to fund levered investments. Leverage exposes banks to funding risk, which they insure by holding liquidity buffers. By changing the nominal rate the central bank inﬂuences the liquidity premium, and hence the cost of taking leverage. Lower nominal rates make liquidity cheaper and raise leverage, resulting in lower risk premia and higher asset prices, volatility, investment, and growth. We analyze forward guidance, a “Greenspan put,” and the yield curve. IN Textbook Models(e.g., Woodford (2003)), monetary policy works by chang- ing the real interest rate. Yet a growing body of empirical evidence shows that monetary policy also has a large impact on therisk premium component of the cost of capital.1 Moreover, many central bank interventions can be use- fully interpreted as targeting risk premia. For instance, a “Greenspan put” in the 1990s and low interest rates in the mid-2000s arguably led to excessive leverage and compressed spreads.2 During the ﬁnancial crisis, large-scale as- set purchases, equity injections, and asset guarantees were all explicitly aimed at supporting risky asset prices (see Bernanke (2013) for a discussion). Since the crisis, with spreads near historic lows, an important debate has centered on whether low interest rates fuel “reaching for yield” and",

    "title": "A Model of Mortgage Default",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we solve a dynamic model of households’ mortgage decisions incorpo- rating labor income, house price, inﬂation, and interest rate risk. Using a zero-proﬁt condition for mortgage lenders, we solve for equilibrium mortgage rates given bor- rower characteristics and optimal decisions. The model quantiﬁes the effects of ad- justable versus ﬁxed mortgage rates, loan-to-value ratios, and mortgage affordability measures on mortgage premia and default. Mortgage selection by heterogeneous bor- rowers helps explain the higher default rates on adjustable-rate mortgages during the recent U.S. Housing downturn, and the variation in mortgage premia with the level of interest rates. THE Early Years OF THE 21ST Century were characterized by unprecedented instability in house prices and mortgage market conditions, both in the United States and globally. After the housing credit boom in the mid-2000s, the housing downturn of the late 2000s saw dramatic increases in mortgage defaults. Fore- closures appear to have had negative feedback effects on the values of neigh- boring properties, worsening the decline in house prices (Campbell, Giglio, and Pathak (2011)). Losses to mortgage lenders stressed the ﬁnancial system and contributed to the larger economic downturn. These events have underscored the importance of understanding household incentives to default on mortgages, and the way in which these incentives vary across different types of mortgage contracts.

    "abstract": "We present a model of shadow banking in which banks originate and trade loans, assemble them into diversiﬁed portfolios, and ﬁnance these portfolios externally with riskless debt. In this model: outside investor wealth drives the demand for riskless debt and indirectly for securitization, bank assets and leverage move together, banks become interconnected through markets, and banks increase their exposure to sys- tematic risk as they reduce idiosyncratic risk through diversiﬁcation. The shadow banking system is stable and welfare improving under rational expectations, but vulnerable to crises and liquidity dry-ups when investors neglect tail risks. Shadow Banking Typically DESCRIBESﬁnancial activities occurring outside the regulated banking sector. In recent years, the most important such activities took the form of rapidly expanding provision of short-term safe debt to ﬁnan- cial intermediaries through money market funds and other sources outside of the regulated banking sector (Coval, Jurek, and Stafford (2009a), Gorton and Metrick (2010, 2012), Pozsar et al. (2010), Shin (2009)). Much of that debt was collateralized through the process called securitization, which involves origina- tion and acquisition of loans by ﬁnancial intermediaries, the assembly of these loans into diversiﬁed pools, and the tranching of the pools to manufacture safe pieces. While regulated banks played a key role in securitization and held large amounts of securitized assets, a large share of the ult",

    "title": "A Model of Systemic Bank Runs",
    "abstract": "We develop a tractable model of systemic bank runs. The market-based banking sys- tem features a two-layer structure: banks with heterogeneous fundamentals face po- tential runs by their creditors while they trade short-term funding in the asset (in- terbank) market in response to creditor withdrawals. The possibility of a run on a particular bank depends on its assets’ interim liquidation value, and this value de- pends endogenously in turn on the status of other banks in the asset market. The within-bank coordination problem among creditors and the cross-bank price exter- nality feed into each other. A small shock can be ampliﬁed into a systemic crisis. AT THE Heart OF THE ﬁnancial crisis of 2007 to 2009 was a series of bank runs that caused failures or impairments of many ﬁnancial institutions (Bernanke (2010), Gorton ( 2010), Gertler, Kiyotaki, and Prestipino ( 2020)).1 Empirical re- search has revealed two key facts about how the crisis evolved.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a new simulation-based approach for optimal portfolio allocation in realistic environments with complex dynamics for the state vari- ables and large numbers of factors and assets. A first illustration involves a choice between equity and cash with nonlinear interest rate and market price of risk dynamics. Intertemporal hedging demands significantly increase the demand for stocks and exhibit low volatility. We then analyze settings where stock returns are also predicted by dividend yields and where investors have wealth-dependent relative risk aversion. Large-scale problems with many assets, including the Nasdaq, SP500, bonds, and cash, are also examined. The question of optimal portfolio allocation has been of long-standing interest for academics and practitioners in finance. While the mean-variance analysis of Markowitz (1952) is still commonly used among portfolio managers, it has been well understood, since Merton (1971), that long-term investors would prefer port- folios that include hedging components to protect against fluctuations in their investment opportunities. Prompted by the seminal papers of Merton (1969, 1971) and Samuelson (1969), studies have explored various aspects of the dynamic portfolio problem when asset prices follow diffusion processes (e.g., Richard (1975)). This literature has relied, for the most part, on a dynamic programming approach to the problem. More recent contributions by Pliska (1986), Karatzas, Lehoczky, and Shreve (19",

    "abstract": "This paper analyzes the capital structures of foreign affiliates and internal capital markets of multinational corporations. Ten percent higher local tax rates are associ- ated with 2.8% higher debt/asset ratios, with internal borrowing being particularly sensitive to taxes. Multinational affiliates are financed with less external debt in countries with underdeveloped capital markets or weak creditor rights, reflecting significantly higher local borrowing costs. Instrumental variable analysis indicates that greater borrowing from parent companies substitutes for three-quarters of re- duced external borrowing induced by capital market conditions. Multinational firms appear to employ internal capital markets opportunistically to overcome imperfec- tions in external capital markets. TO What Extent Does Corporate Borrowing increase due to the tax deductibility of interest expenses and decline in response to costs imposed by capital market underdevelopment or unfavorable legal systems? Do firms use internal capital markets to substitute for external finance when the latter is costly, and if so, how extensive is such substitution? Empirical attempts to answer these funda- mental questions face significant challenges. Limited variation in tax incentives within countries makes it difficult to identify the effects of taxes, and detailed information on the workings of internal capital markets is scarce.

    "abstract": "Growing evidence suggests that extraordinary average returns may be obtained by trading equity index options, and that at least part of this abnormal performance is attributable to volatility and jump risk premia. This paper asks whether such priced risk factors are alone sufficient to explain these average returns. To provide an answer in as general as possible a setting, I estimate a flexible class of nonlinear models using all S&P 500 Index futures options traded between 1986 and 2000. The results show that priced factors contribute to these expected returns but are insufficient to explain their magnitudes, particularly for short-term out-of-the-money puts. IN A Recent Paper ,C Oval AND Shumway (2001) examine the returns on delta- hedged option positions, focusing on the at-the-money straddle, and find aver- age returns close to minus 3% per week. Since over short time horizons these positions are approximately invariant to movements in the underlying index, Coval and Shumway argue that their Capm betas should be near zero and their expected returns close to the risk-free rate. They conclude that large deviations from the Capm are the norm, which they suggest is evidence that some other systematic factor, such as stochastic volatility, might be priced by the market. Similar conclusions are made by Jackwerth (2000), who finds risk-adjusted profitability from selling puts, and by Bakshi and Kapadia (2003), who find that the volatility risk premium contributes significantly t",

We show that global savings gluts and monetary policies widened the U.S. NFA position, while investor demand shifts partially offset this widening. Moreover, U.S. Privilege declined after 2010, in line with increasing foreign demand for U.S. Equity. We also highlight a quantity dimension of the U.S. Privilege: The U.S. Can issue substantially more debt than other countries for a given yield increase. IN Recent Decades , THE NET external portfolio position of the U.S. Has be- come substantially more negative. At the end of 2019, non-U.S. Investors held 20.4 trillion dollars worth of U.S. External liabilities.

    "title": "A Pyrrhic Victory? Bank Bailouts and Sovereign",
    "abstract": "We model a loop between sovereign and bank credit risk. A distressed ﬁnancial sector induces government bailouts, whose cost increases sovereign credit risk. Increased sovereign credit risk in turn weakens the ﬁnancial sector by eroding the value of its government guarantees and bond holdings. Using credit default swap (CDS) rates on European sovereigns and banks, we show that bailouts triggered the rise of sovereign credit risk in 2008. We document that post-bailout changes in sovereign CDS explain changes in bank CDS even after controlling for aggregate and bank-level determi- nants of credit spreads, conﬁrming the sovereign-bank loop. Prior TO THE Financial Crisis of 2007 to 2008, there was essentially no sign of sovereign credit risk in the developed economies, and the prevailing view was that such risk was unlikely to be a concern for these economies in the near future. However, since the fall of 2008 sovereign credit risk has become a signiﬁcant problem for a number of developed countries, most notably in Europe. In this paper, we examine three closely related questions surrounding this development. First, were the ﬁnancial sector bailouts an integral factor in igniting the rise of sovereign credit risk in the developed economies? We show that they were. Second, what was the mechanism that caused the transmission of risks between the ﬁnancial sector and the sovereign? We propose a model wherein the government can ﬁnance a bailout through increased taxation and via dilut",

    "title": "A Rational Expectations Equilibrium with Informative Trading Volume",
    "abstract": "A large number of empirical studies find that trading volume contains information about the distribution of future returns. While these studies indicate that observing volume is helpful to an outside observer of the economy it is not clear how investors within the economy can learn from trading volume. In this paper, I show how trading volume helps investors to evaluate the precision of the aggregate information in the price. I construct a model that offers a closed-form solution of a rational expectations equilibrium where all investors learn from (1) private signals, (2) the market price, and (3) aggregate trading volume. IN A Financial market every investor is interested in the private information that other investors might possess. There are several ways to learn what other market participants know. For example, starting with Grossman (1976) a large number of authors have examined how investors can extract private informa- tion from prices. In this paper, I provide a closed-form solution for a rational expectations equilibrium (REE) where all investors infer information about the state of the economy from (1) private signals, (2) the market price, and (3) aggregate trading volume.

    "title": "A Rational Expectations Model",
    "abstract": "We develop a multiple asset rational expectations model of asset prices to explain financial market contagion. Although the model allows contagion through several channels, our focus is on contagion through cross-market rebalancing. Through this channel, investors transmit idiosyncratic shocks from one market to others by adjusting their portfolios' exposures to shared macroeconomic risks. The pattern and severity of financial contagion depends on markets' sensitivities to shared macroeconomic risk factors, and on the amount of information asymmetry in each market. The model can generate contagion in the absence of news, as well as be- tween markets that do not directly share macroeconomic risks. A Spate OF Recent Financial CRISES-the Mexican crisis of 1995, the Asian crisis of 1997 to 1998, the default of the Russian government in August 1998, the sharp depreciation of the real in Brazil in 1999-have been ac- companied by episodes of financial markets contagion in which many coun- tries have experienced increases in the volatility and comovement of their financial asset markets on a day-to-day basis. The pattern of contagion has been uneven across both time and countries-with increased volatility and comovement occurring principally during times of financial and exchange rate crises-and with some countries, particularly those with emerging fi- nancial markets, having experienced the bulk of the contagion, while coun- tries with more developed markets have remained relatively",

    "abstract": "We review the theory and evidence on IPO activity: why firms go public, why they reward first-day investors with considerable underpricing, and how IPOs perform in the long run. Our perspective is threefold: First, we believe that many IPO argue that asymmetric information is not the primary driver of many IPO phe- nomena. Instead, we believe future progress in the literature will come from non- rational and agency conflict explanations. We describe some promising such alternatives. From 1980 to 2001, the number of companies going public in the United States exceeded one per business day. The number of initial public offerings (IPOs) has varied from year to year, however, with some years seeing fewer than 100 IPOs, and others seeing more than 400. These IPOs raised $488 billion (in 2001 dollars) in gross proceeds, an average of $78 million per deal. At the end of the first day of trading, their shares traded on average at 18.8 percent above the price at which the company sold them. For an investor buying shares at the first-day closing price and holding them for three years, IPOs returned 22.6 percent. Still, over three years, the average IPO under- performed the Crsp value-weighted market index by 23.4 percent and un- derperformed seasoned companies with the same market capitalization and book-to-market ratio by 5.1 percent. In a nutshell, these numbers summarize the patterns in issuing activity, underpricing, and long-run underperformance, which have been the focus of a lar",

    "abstract": "We propose a model in which assets with identical cash flows can trade at different prices. Infinitely lived agents can establish long positions in a search spot market, or short positions by first borrowing an asset in a search repo market. We show that short-sellers can endogenously concentrate in one asset because of search external- ities and the constraint that they must deliver the asset they borrowed. That asset enjoys greater liquidity, a higher lending fee (“specialness”), and trades at a premium consistent with no-arbitrage. We derive closed-form solutions for small frictions, and provide a calibration generating realistic on-the-run premia. IN Fixed Income Markets Some Bonds Trade at lower yields than others with almost identical cash flows. In the United States, for example, just-issued (“on-the-run”) Treasury bonds trade at lower yields than previously issued (“off-the-run”) bonds maturing on nearby dates. Warga (1992) reports that an on-the-run portfolio returns on average 55 bps less than an off-the-run portfolio with matched duration. Similar phenomena exist in other countries. In Japan, for example, one “benchmark” government bond trades at a yield that is 60 bps below other bonds with comparable characteristics.

    "abstract": "We develop a bid-ask spread estimator from daily high and low prices. Daily high (low) prices are almost always buy (sell) trades. Hence, the high–low ratio reﬂects both the stock’s variance and its bid-ask spread. Although the variance component of the high–low ratio is proportional to the return interval, the spread component is not. This allows us to derive a spread estimator as a function of high–low ratios over 1-day and 2-day intervals. The estimator is easy to calculate, can be applied in a variety of IN This Paper , we derive a simple way to estimate bid-ask spreads from daily high and low prices. The estimator is based on two uncontroversial ideas. First, daily high prices are almost always buyer-initiated trades and daily low prices are almost always seller-initiated trades. The ratio of high-to-low prices for a day therefore reﬂects both the fundamental volatility of the stock and its bid-ask spread. Second, the component of the high-to-low price ra- tio that is due to volatility increases proportionately with the length of the trading interval, while the component due to bid-ask spreads does not. This implies that the sum of the price ranges over 2 consecutive single days reﬂects 2 days’ volatility and twice the spread, while the price range over one 2-day period reﬂects 2 days’ volatility and one spread. This allows us to derive an es- timate of a stock’s bid-ask spread as a function of the high-to-low price ratio for a single 2-day period and the high-to-low rat",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the dynamic interaction between the net positions of traders and risk premiums in commodity futures markets. Short-term position changes are driven mainly by the liquidity demands of noncommercial traders, while long-term varia- tion is driven primarily by the hedging demands of commercial traders. These two components inﬂuence expected futures returns with opposite signs. The gains from providing liquidity by commercials largely offset the premium they pay for obtaining price insurance. AN Important Question IN THE commodity futures literature concerns the in- ﬂuence of speculative activity on the price formation in futures markets. Ac- cording to the traditional view of Keynes (1923) and Hicks (1939), the presence of speculative capital facilitates risk-sharing for hedgers who seek insurance against future price ﬂuctuations.

    "title": "A Tale of Two Runs: Depositor Responses to Bank",
    "abstract": "We examine heterogeneity in depositor responses to solvency risk using depositor- level data for a bank that faced two different runs. We ﬁnd that depositors with loans and bank staff are less likely to run than others during a low-solvency-risk shock, but are more likely to run during a high-solvency-risk shock. Uninsured depositors are also sensitive to bank solvency. In contrast, depositors with older accounts run less, and those with frequent past transactions run more, irrespective of the underlying risk. Our results show that the fragility of a bank depends on the composition of its deposit base. WHO Runs ON A Bank, AND why? We know that runs are related to bank solvency in aggregate (Saunders and Wilson (1996), Calomiris and Mason (1997)). Yet deposits are not a homogeneous mass—they are held by people with different histories and different relationships to their banks. A person with only a mod- est checking account, for example, may not bother to learn about her bank’s ﬁnancial health, whereas those with higher balances or a broader relationship (e.g., they also hold a loan) may know more about their bank and as a result have more reason to act on that knowledge, since their ﬁnancial well-being is tied up with their bank’s.1 Following this line of thought, if some kinds of depositors are more or less sensitive to the solvency risk of their bank, then the make-up of a bank’s deposit base may be an important determinant of stability.

    "title": "A Test of the Errors-in-Expectations",
    "abstract": "Several empirical studies show that investment strategies that favor the purchase of stocks with low prices relative to conventional measures of value yield higher returns. Some of these studies imply that investors are too optimistic about (glam- our) stocks that have had good performance in the recent past and too pessimistic about (value) stocks that have performed poorly. We examine whether investors systematically overestimate (underestimate) the future earnings performance of glamour (value) stocks over the 1976 to 1997 period. Our results fail to support the extrapolation hypothesis that posits that the superior performance of value stocks is because investors make systematic errors in predicting future growth in earn- ings of out-of-favor stocks. FOR Many Years, Academics and investment professionals have argued that investment strategies that call for the purchase of stocks with low prices relative to dividends, earnings, book value, or other measures of value pro- duce higher returns (Graham and Dodd (1934) and Dreman (1977)). While recent U.S. And international empirical evidence shows that value (or out- of-favor) stocks earn higher returns than growth (or glamour) stocks (Fama and French (1992, 1993, 1996), Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny (1994; here- after, LSV), and Arshanapalli, Coggin, and Doukas (1998)), the interpreta- tion of why value outperforms growth strategies remains controversial.

    "abstract": "Modigliani and Miller show that the total market value of a ﬁrm is unaffected by a repackaging of asset return streams to equity and debt if pricing is arbitrage-free. We investigate this invariance theorem in experimental asset markets, ﬁnding value- invariance for assets of identical risks when returns are perfectly correlated. However, exploiting price discrepancies has risk when returns have the same expected value but are uncorrelated, in which case the law of one price is violated. Discrepancies shrink in consecutive markets, but persist even with experienced traders. In markets where overall trader acuity is high, assets trade closer to parity. IN Their Seminal Paper, Modigliani and Miller (1958, 1963) show mathemat- ically that the market value of a ﬁrm is invariant to the ﬁrm’s leverage— different packaging of contractual claims on the ﬁrm’s assets does not im- pact the total market value of the ﬁrm’s debt and equity. The Modigliani and Miller—henceforth MM—value-invariance theorem suggests that the law of one price prevails for assets of the same “risk class.” The core of the theorem is an arbitrage proof, whereby if two assets, one leveraged and one unleveraged, represent claims on the same cash ﬂow, any market discrepancies that arise are arbitraged away. But due to its assumptions of perfect capital markets and the no-limits-to-arbitrage condition (which requires the perfect positive correlation disclose.

    "abstract": "We study the pricing effects of dividend and earnings announcements by taking advantage of the unique setting in Japan where managers simultaneously an- nounce the current year's dividends and earnings as well as forecasts of next year's dividends and earnings. Defining surprises as deviations from analysts' forecasts, we find that share price reactions are significantly affected by earn- ings surprises, especially management forecasts of next year's earnings. The in- formation content of dividends is marginal and is restricted to announcements of next year's dividends. Consistent with Modigliani and Miller's dividend irrele- vance proposition, current dividend surprises have no material impact on stock prices in Japan. Since Modigliani AND Miller Initiated Modern corporate finance theory (see Modigliani and Miller (1958) and Miller and Modigliani (1961)), academic wisdom has been that because dividends do not change a firm's underlying investment policy and cash flows, dividend policy is irrelevant to firm value. It is earnings and earnings potential (the investment opportunity set) that are fundamental determinants of firm value: An extra dollar of dividends does not create value because it comes at the cost of a dollar of capital gains. Thus, it is of little surprise to find that numerous empirical studies show earnings announcements convey information that prompts investors to re- vise stock prices.

    "title": "A Theory of Bank Capital",
    "abstract": "Banks can create liquidity precisely because deposits are fragile and prone to runs. Increased uncertainty makes deposits excessively fragile, creating a role for out- side bank capital. Greater bank capital reduces the probability of financial distress but also reduces liquidity creation. The quantity of capital influences the amount that banks can induce borrowers to pay. Optimal bank capital structure trades off effects on liquidity creation, costs of bank distress, and the ability to force borrower repayment. The model explains the decline in bank capital over the last two cen- turies. It identifies overlooked consequences of having regulatory capital require- ments and deposit insurance. Does Bank Capital Structure Matter, and if so, how should it be set? Most work on the subject extrapolates an answer from prior work on the capital structure of industrial firms. But bank assets and functions are not the same as those of industrial firms. In fact, one strand of the banking litera- ture suggests banks have a role precisely because they do not suffer the asymmetric information costs of issuance faced by industrial firms (see Gor- ton and Pennacchi (1990)). Therefore, to really understand the determinants of bank capital structure, we should start by modeling the essential func- tions banks perform, and then ask what role capital plays. Using this approach, we can see that a bank's capital structure affects its liquidity- creation and credit-creation functions in addition t",

    "abstract": "Debt maturity inﬂuences debt overhang, the reduced incentive for highly levered borrowers to make real investments because some value accrues to debt. Reducing maturity can increase or decrease overhang even when shorter term debt’s value depends less on ﬁrm value. Future overhang is more volatile for shorter term debt, making future investment incentives volatile and inﬂuencing immediate investment incentives. With immediate investment, shorter term debt typically imposes lower overhang; longer term debt can impose less if asset volatility is higher in bad times. For future investments, reduced correlation between assets-in-place and investment opportunities increases the shorter term debt overhang. This Paper Studies THEeffects of debt maturity on the current and future real investment decisions of an equity owner (or a manager who is compensated by equity). Our analysis is based on debt overhang ﬁrst analyzed by Myers (1977), who points out that outstanding debt may distort the ﬁrm’s investment incentives downward. Reduced incentives to undertake proﬁtable investments when decision makers seek to maximize equity value is referred to as “debt overhang,” because part of the return from a current new investment makes existing debt more valuable. Myers (1977) suggests short-term debt as a possible solution to the debt overhang problem.

    "title": "A Theory of Dividends Based",
    "abstract": "This paper explains why some firms prefer to pay dividends rather than repur- chase shares. When institutional investors are relatively less taxed than individ- ual investors, dividends induce \"ownership clientele\" effects. Firms paying dividends attract relatively more institutions, which have a relative advantage in detecting high firm quality and in ensuring firms are well managed. The theory is consistent with some documented regularities, specifically both the presence and stickiness of dividends, and offers novel empirical implications, e.g., a prediction that it is the tax difference between institutions and retail investors that determines dividend payments, not the absolute tax payments. Although A Number OF Theories have been put forward in the literature to explain their pervasive presence,1 dividends remain one of the thorniest puz- zles in corporate finance. In a frictionless world without taxes or transaction costs, dividends and share repurchases are equivalent. If dividends are taxed more heavily than capital gains, as is the case in the United States and many other countries, share repurchases are apparently superior to divi- dends. Nevertheless, dividends continue to be a substantial proportion of earnings-and personal dividend taxes continue to be a substantial source of income for the I.R.S. For the 1973 to 1983 period, dividends for the largest 1,000 firms in the United States averaged 44 percent of earnings whereas repurchases averaged only 6 percent (se",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a dynamic change of measure approach for computing ana- lytical solutions of expected future prices (and therefore, expected returns) of con- tingent claims over a ﬁnite horizon. The new approach constructs hybrid probability measures called equivalent expectation measures (EEMs) that provide the physical expectation of the claim’s future price before the horizon date, and serve as pricing measures on or after the horizon date. The EEM theory can be used for empirical in- vestigations of both the cross-section and the term structure of returns of contingent claims, such as Treasury bonds, corporate bonds, and ﬁnancial derivatives. THE Change OF Measure Concept lies at the heart of asset pricing. Almost half a century ago, the no-arbitrage derivations of the call option price by Black and Scholes ( 1973) and Merton ( 1973b) led to the discovery of the standard change of measure approach, which assigns risk-neutral or equivalent martin- gale probabilities to all future events. 1 Extending this static approach, which changes the pricing measure only at the current time, we develop a dynamic change of measure approach that changes the pricing measure at any given fu- ture horizon date H between the current time t and the claim’s expiration date T.

    "abstract": "We analyze the consequences of the board’s dual role as advisor as well as monitor of management. Given this dual role, the CEO faces a trade-off in disclosing information to the board: If he reveals his information, he receives better advice; however, an informed board will also monitor him more intensively. Since an independent board is a tougher monitor, the CEO may be reluctant to share information with it. Thus, management-friendly boards can be optimal. Using the insights from the model, we analyze the differences between sole and dual board systems. We highlight several policy implications of our analysis. Too much emphasis on monitoring tends to create a rift between non- executive and executive directors, whereas the more traditional job of forming strategy requires close collaboration. In both activities, though, independent directors face the same problem: they depend largely on the chief executive and the company’s management for information.

A pyramid allows a family to access all retained earnings of a firm it already controls to set up a new firm, and to share the new firm’s nondiverted payoff with share- holders of the original firm. Our model is consistent with recent evidence of a small separation between ownership and control in some pyramids, and can differentiate between pyramids and dual-class shares, even when either method can achieve the same deviation from one share–one vote. Other predictions of the model are consistent with both systematic and anecdotal evidence. Many Firms Have A Controlling Shareholder , usually a family or the state (La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer (1999)). Moreover, in several countries, single individuals or families control a large number of firms.

    "abstract": "We present a real-options model of takeovers and disinvestment in declining indus- tries. As product demand declines, a first-best closure level is reached, where overall value is maximized by closing the firm and releasing its capital to investors. Ab- sent takeovers, managers of underleveraged firms always close too late, although golden parachutes may accelerate closure. We analyze the effects of takeovers of under- leveraged firms. Takeovers by raiders enforce first-best closure. Hostile takeovers by other firms occur either at the first-best closure point or too early. Closure in man- agement buyouts and mergers of equals happens inefficiently late. There is no single hypothesis which is both plausible and general and which shows promise of explaining the current merger movement. If so, it is correct to say that there is nothing known about mergers; there are no useful generalizations. (Segall, 1968, p. 19)",

    "title": "A Theory of Zombie Lending",
    "abstract": "An entrepreneur borrows from a relationship bank or the market. The bank has a higher cost of capital but produces private information over time. While the en- trepreneur accumulates reputation as the lending relationship continues, asymmet- ric information is also developed between the bank/entrepreneur and the market. In this setting, zombie lending is inevitable: Once the entrepreneur becomes sufﬁciently reputable, the bank will roll over loans even after learning bad news, for the prospect of future market ﬁnancing. Zombie lending is mitigated when the entrepreneur faces ﬁnancial constraints. Finally , the bank stops producing information too early if infor- mation production is costly . Zombie Firms — Firms Whose Operating cash ﬂows persistently fall below their interest payments—are common in the real world. According to a recent study by Banerjee and Hofmann (2018), zombie ﬁrms make up about 12% of all publicly traded ﬁrms across 14 advanced economies. These ﬁrms are detrimental to the real economy as they crowd out credit to their healthy com- petitors and thereby reduce aggregate productivity and investment. Indeed, zombie lending has long been perceived as the main reason behind Japan’s “lost decade” in the 1990s (Caballero, Hoshi, and Kashyap (2008), Peek and Rosengren (2005)), and more recently , Acharya et al. (2019) and Blattner, Farinha, and Rebelo (2019) show that Europe’s economic recovery from the debt crisis has been plagued by bank lending to zombie ﬁrms.",

    "title": "A Theory of the Syndicate:",
    "abstract": "We relate the organizational form of investment banking syndicates to moral haz- ard in team production. Although syndicates are dissolved upon deal completion, membership stability across deals represents a barrier to entry that enables the capture of quasi-rents. This improves incentives for individual bankers to cultivate investor relationships that translate into greater expected proceeds. Reputational concerns of lead bankers amplify the effect. We derive conditions under which re- stricted entry and designation of a lead banker strictly Pareto dominate, in which case it is also strictly Pareto dominant for the syndicate’s fee to be greater than members’ cost of participation. IN 1997 Alone, Approximately $1.3 trillion in new securities were sold in the U.S. Public debt and equity markets.

To gain intuition for our argument, it is useful to think of securities of- ferings as having two stages. The first is a period of preparation for the issuing firm and market.

    "abstract": "A contrast effect occurs when the value of a previously observed signal inversely biases perception of the next signal. We present the ﬁrst evidence that contrast effects can distort prices in sophisticated and liquid markets. Investors mistakenly perceive earnings news today as more impressive if yesterday’s earnings surprise was bad and less impressive if yesterday’s surprise was good. A unique advantage of our ﬁnancial setting is that we can identify contrast effects as an error in perceptions rather than expectations. Finally, we show that our results cannot be explained by an alternative explanation involving information transmission from previous earnings announcements.

    "abstract": "We develop a uniﬁed theory of dynamic contracting and assortative matching to explain ﬁrm dynamics. In our model, neither ﬁrms nor managers can commit to arrangements that yield lower payoffs than their outside options, which are microfounded by the equilibrium conditions in a matching market. The model en- dogenously generates power laws in ﬁrm size and CEO compensation, and explains differences in their right tails. We also show that our model quantitatively accounts for many salient features of the time-series dynamics and the cross-sectional distri- bution of ﬁrm investment, dividend payout, and CEO compensation. IN This Paper , WE Provide a uniﬁed theory of limited commitment and assortative matching to account for several stylized features of the dynamics of ﬁrm investment, dividend payout, and managerial compensation. The contracting literature on limited commitment has developed a compelling theoretical framework describing the dynamics of ﬁrm growth and managerial compensation (Albuquerque and Hopenhayn (2004), Harris and Holmstrom (1982)). Yet, the quantitative relevance of limited commitment remains unre- solved because the outside options of ﬁrms and managers, which, in existing models are speciﬁed exogenously , are difﬁcult to measure empirically . To impose discipline and to provide a microfoundation for the outside options, we integrate an assortative matching framework into the theory of dynamic con- tracting with limited commitment.

    "abstract": "We propose a model of dynamic investment, ﬁnancing, and risk management for ﬁnancially constrained ﬁrms. The model highlights the central importance of the en- dogenous marginal value of liquidity (cash and credit line) for corporate decisions. Our three main results are: (1) investment depends on the ratio of marginalq to the marginal value of liquidity, and the relation between investment and marginal q changes with the marginal source of funding; (2) optimal external ﬁnancing and payout are characterized by an endogenous double-barrier policy for the ﬁrm’s cash- capital ratio; and (3) liquidity management and derivatives hedging are complemen- tary risk management tools. When Firms Face External ﬁnancing costs, they must deal with complex and closely intertwined investment, ﬁnancing, and risk management decisions. How to formalize the interconnections among these margins in a dynamic setting and how to translate the theory into day-to-day risk management and real investment policies remains largely to be determined. Questions such as how corporations should manage their cash holdings, which risks they should hedge and by how much, or the extent to which holding cash is a substitute for ﬁnancial hedging are not well understood. Our goal in this article is to propose the ﬁrst elements of a tractable dy- namic corporate risk management framework—as illustrated in Figure 1—in which cash inventory, corporate investment, external ﬁnancing, payout, and dynamic hedging policies ar",

    "abstract": "We propose a tractable model of dynamic investment, spinoffs, ﬁnancing, and risk management for a multidivision ﬁrm facing costly external ﬁnance. Our analysis for- malizes the following insights: (i) Within-ﬁrm resource allocation is based not only on divisions’ productivity, as in winner-picking models, but also their risk; (ii) ﬁrms may voluntarily spin off productive divisions to increase liquidity; (iii) diversiﬁcation can reduce ﬁrm value in low-liquidity states, as it increases the spinoff cost and hampers liquidity management; (iv) corporate socialism makes liquidity less valuable; and (v) division investment is determined by the ratio between marginalq and marginal value of cash. Multidivision Firms — That IS , Firms that operate two or more divisions and allocate resources to their divisions through an internal capital market— play an important role in the economy . For example, Maksimovic and Phillips (2002) estimate that multidivision ﬁrms account for about three-fourths of to- tal output in the U.S. Manufacturing sector. The empirical literature shows that multidivision ﬁrms behave very differ- ently compared to stand-alone ﬁrms. These differences are found across ﬁrm Ckgsb, Nber, and Abfer.

    "abstract": "Based upon a large data set of public and private firms in the United Kingdom, I find that compared to their public counterparts, private firms rely almost exclusively on debt financing, have higher leverage ratios, and tend to avoid external capital markets, leading to a greater sensitivity of their capital structures to fluctuations in performance. I argue that these differences are due to private equity being more costly than public equity. I further examine the private firms subsample to show that private equity is more costly than its public counterpart due to information asymmetry and the desire to maintain control. Theories OF Corporate Capital Structure offer a number of predictions concern- ing the composition and characteristics of the securities that firms issue. To date, empirical studies examining these predictions focus almost exclusively on their validity in the context of publicly traded firms, in large part due to data availability. As a result, relatively little is known about the financing behavior of privately held firms. Indeed, a number of fundamental questions concerning private firms remain unanswered: What characterizes the capital structures and funding behavior of private firms? Do existing theories of capital structure provide an appropriate description of the financing behavior of private firms? Do the capital structures and corresponding financial policies of private firms differ from those of their public counterparts in a manner consistent with",

    "title": "Access to Collateral and Corporate Debt",
    "abstract": "We investigate how ﬁrms respond to strengthening of creditor rights by examining their ﬁnancial decisions following a securitization reform in India. We ﬁnd that the reform led to a reduction in secured debt, total debt, debt maturity, and asset growth, and an increase in liquidity hoarding by ﬁrms. Moreover, the effects are more pro- nounced for ﬁrms that have a higher proportion of tangible assets because these ﬁrms are more affected by the secured transactions law. These results suggest that strengthening of creditor rights introduces a liquidation bias and documents how ﬁrms alter their debt structures to contract around it. THE Seminal Paper BYLa Porta et al. (1998; henceforth Llsv) titled “Law and Finance” and subsequent literature link creditor rights with ﬁnancial develop- ment by documenting a positive correlation between an index of creditor rights and the size of credit markets in cross-country regressions. 1 These ﬁndings support the view that ownership protection, particularly in credit markets, fosters ﬁnancial development by lowering the cost of credit. According to this view, the major function attributed to law is that it empowers creditors to en- force their contracts. The bankruptcy literature on the merits of Chapter 11 and bankruptcy reorganization suggests that creditor rights could be excessive and lead to ex post inefﬁciencies in the form of a liquidation bias (see Aghion, Charlie Calomiris, Ray Fisman, Denis Gromb, Oliver Hart, Daniel Paravisini, and",

    "title": "Adaptive Traders and the Design",
    "abstract": "This paper studies a financial market populated by adaptive traders. Learning is mod- eled following Camerer and Ho (1999). A call market and a Walrasian tatonnement are compared in an environment in which both institutions have the same Nash and competitive equilibrium outcomes. When traders learn via a belief-based model, equi- librium is discovered in both types of markets. In contrast, when traders learn via a reinforcement-based model, convergence to equilibrium is achieved in the Walrasian tatonnement but not in the call market. This paper suggests that market mechanisms can be designed to foster traders’ learning of equilibrium strategies. THE Risk OF Transacting With A More OR Less informed investor is inherent to trading in financial markets. This so-called adverse selection risk gives rise to a variety of interesting questions.1 Do financial market prices reveal investors’ private information? Do investors design their trading strategies to mitigate ad- verse selection risk? Does market organization influence traders’ strategies and in turn market efficiency? While these questions have been extensively studied using perfectly rational traders, less attention has been devoted to the case in which traders are boundedly rational. 2 This paper addresses these issues in the context of financial markets populated by boundedly rational traders. Starting with Simon (1955), numerous academic studies document the attrac- tiveness of bounded rationality to model decision makin",

    "title": "Advance Refundings of Municipal Bonds",
    "abstract": "The advance refunding of debt is a widespread practice in municipal ﬁnance. In an advance refunding, municipalities retire callable bonds early and refund them with bonds with lower coupon rates. We ﬁnd that 85% of all advance refundings occur at a net present value loss, and that the aggregate losses over the past 20 years exceed $15 billion. We explore why municipalities advance refund their debt at loss. Finan- cially constrained municipalities may face pressure to advance refund since it allows them to reduce short-term cash outﬂows. We ﬁnd strong evidence that ﬁnancial con- straints are a major driver of advance refunding activity. ONE OF THE Most Important TRENDSin municipal ﬁnance over the past decade is the dramatic increase in the number of bonds that are advance refunded. In an advance refunding, also known as a pre-refunding, a municipality issues new debt to retire an existing callable bond issue that is not yet callable.1 The number of municipal bond issues advance refunded per year has increased from roughly 300 in the late 1990s to more than 30,000 over the 2012 to 2013 period. Nearly 50% of the $300 to $400 billion of municipal bonds currently issued each year is associated with advance refundings. Karthik Nagarajan, Rafael Porsani, Jackson Pfeiffer, and Tsuyoshi Sasaki.

    "abstract": "Using information on advertising and mortgages originated by subprime lenders, we study whether advertising helped consumers ﬁnd cheaper mortgages. Lenders that advertise more within a region sell more expensive mortgages, measured as the excess rate of a mortgage after accounting for borrower, contract, and regional characteristics. These effects are stronger for mortgages sold to less sophisticated consumers. We exploit regional variation in mortgage advertising induced by the entry of Craigslist and other tests to demonstrate that these ﬁndings are not spurious. Analyzing advertising content reveals that initial/introductory rates are frequently advertised in a salient fashion, where reset rates are not. Recent Literature Shows THE importance of search in the mortgage market (Mayer and Pence (2009), Scharfstein and Sunderam (2013)). Although mort- gages are relatively homogeneous products, search frictions create a demand for information about mortgages that lenders can cater to. There are two broad views on how lenders use advertising to supply this information to consumers. On the one hand, the information view claims that advertising allows con- sumers to ﬁnd better products (Nelson (1974)). On the other hand, the per- suasion view suggests that advertising is used to steer consumers into bad choices (Braithwaite (1928), Thaler and Sunstein (2008)).

    "abstract": "We analyze control transfers in firms with a dominant minority blockholder and otherwise dispersed owners, and show that the transaction mode is important. Negotiated block trades preserve a low level of ownership concentration, inducing more inefficient extraction of private benefits. In contrast, public acquisitions in- crease ownership concentration, resulting in fewer private benefits and higher firm value. Within our model, the incumbent and new controlling party prefer to trade the block because of the dispersed shareholders' free-riding behavior. We also ex- plore the regulatory implications of this agency problem and its impact on the terms of block trades. THE Role OF Concentrated Ownership for firm value is a central theme in corporate finance. Unlike small shareholders, large blockholders have an incentive to incur costs to improve management and thus increase the value of their shares. Moreover, substantial influence accrues to the owner of a large block, albeit a leading minority block, especially in firms with an other- wise dispersed ownership.' Hence, blockholders are both willing and able to increase firm value. They do so by monitoring and replacing top managers, or even by directly taking part in the firm's operating decisions. The capac- ity to influence corporate decisions has its drawbacks, however. It enables large blockholders to pursue their own goals and extract private benefits Panunzi is at the Universita Bocconi and Cepr. Previous versions of this",

    "abstract": "The separation of ownership and control allows controlling shareholders to pursue pri- vate benefits. We develop an analytically tractable dynamic stochastic general equi- librium model to study asset pricing and welfare implications of imperfect investor protection. Consistent with empirical evidence, the model predicts that countries with weaker investor protection have more incentives to overinvest, lower Tobin’sq, higher return volatility, larger risk premia, and higher interest rate. Calibrating the model to the Korean economy reveals that perfecting investor protection increases the stock market’s value by 22%, a gain for which outside shareholders are willing to pay 11% of their capital stock. IT IS Widely Accepted That Governance problems are of first-order importance in many countries (La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny (1998, 2000a)). Corporations in many countries are run by controlling shareholders whose cash flow rights in the firm are substantially smaller than their control rights (La Porta, L´opez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer (1999)). For example, control- ling shareholders may acquire complete control with cash flow rights signifi- cantly lower than 50% via dual-class shares, pyramid-ownership structures, or cross-ownership (Bebchuk, Kraakman, and Triantis (2000)). The separation of ownership and control allows controlling shareholders to pursue private ben- efits at the cost of outside shareholders. The size of private benefits depends in large par",

    "abstract": "Which agency problems affect corporate cash policy? To answer this question, we es- timate a dynamic model of ﬁnance and investment with three mechanisms that mis- align managerial and shareholder incentives: limited managerial ownership of the ﬁrm, compensation based on ﬁrm size, and managerial perquisite consumption. We ﬁnd that perquisite consumption critically impacts cash policy. Size-based compensa- tion also matters, but less. Firms with lower blockholder and institutional ownership have higher managerial perquisite consumption, low managerial ownership is a key factor in the secular upward trend in cash holdings, and agency plays little role in small ﬁrms’ substantial cash holdings. Manager-shareholder Conflicts undoubtedly play a crucial role in shap- ing corporate ﬁnancial policies. However, the relative importance of different agency concerns is difﬁcult to quantify. The reasons are simple: managers have strong incentives to hide misbehavior, and the incentivizing features of man- agerial employment contracts that induce such misbehavior are not randomly distributed across ﬁrms. Thus, it is difﬁcult to uncover direct evidence of causal links between speciﬁc incentives and ﬁrm policies. We enter this picture with an alternative methodology that helps us explore the links between corporate cash holdings and three individual agency issues, namely, limited managerial ownership, managerial perquisite consumption, and contracts that give more compensation to managers of",

    "abstract": "We provide measures of absolute and relative equity agency costs for corporations under different ownership and management structures. Our base case is Jensen and Meckling's (1976) zero agency-cost firm, where the manager is the firm's sole shareholder. We utilize a sample of 1,708 small corporations from the Frb/nssbf database and find that agency costs (i) are significantly higher when an outsider rather than an insider manages the firm; (ii) are inversely related to the manag- er's ownership share; (iii) increase with the number of nonmanager shareholders, and (iv) to a lesser extent, are lower with greater monitoring by banks. THE Social AND Private Costs OF AN Agent's Actions due to incomplete align- ment of the agent's and owner's interests were brought to attention by the seminal contributions of Jensen and Meckling (1976) on agency costs. Agency theory has also brought the roles of managerial decision rights and various external and internal monitoring and bonding mechanisms to the forefront made in demonstrating empirically the role of agency costs in financial de- cisions, such as in explaining the choices of capital structure, maturity struc- ture, dividend policy, and executive compensation. However, the actual measurement of the principal variable of interest, agency costs, in both ab- solute and relative terms, has lagged behind.

    "abstract": "This paper outlines and tests two agency models of dividends. According to the \"outcome model,\" dividends are paid because minority shareholders pressure cor- porate insiders to disgorge cash. According to the \"substitute model,\" insiders in- terested in issuing equity in the future pay dividends to establish a reputation for decent treatment of minority shareholders. The first model predicts that stronger minority shareholder rights should be associated with higher dividend payouts; the second model predicts the opposite. Tests on a cross section of 4,000 companies from 33 countries with different levels of minority shareholder rights support the outcome agency model of dividends. THE So-called Dividend Puzzle (Black (1976)) has preoccupied the attention of financial economists at least since Modigliani and Miller's seminal work (see Modigliani and Miller (1958) and Miller and Modigliani (1961)). This work established that, in a frictionless world, when the investment policy of a firm is held constant, its dividend payout policy has no consequences for shareholder wealth. Higher dividend payouts lead to lower retained earn- ings and capital gains, and vice versa, leaving total wealth of the sharehold- ers unchanged. Contrary to this prediction, however, corporations follow extremely deliberate dividend payout strategies (Lintner (1956)). This evi- dence raises a puzzle: How do firms choose their dividend policies? In the United States and other countries, the puzzle is even",

    "title": "Agency Problems at Dual-Class Companies",
    "abstract": "Using a sample of U.S. Dual-class companies, we examine how divergence between insider voting and cash flow rights affects managerial extraction of private bene- fits of control. We find that as this divergence widens, corporate cash holdings are worth less to outside shareholders, CEOs receive higher compensation, managers make shareholder value-destroying acquisitions more often, and capital expenditures contribute less to shareholder value. These findings support the agency hypothesis that managers with greater excess control rights over cash flow rights are more prone to pursue private benefits at shareholders’ expense, and help explain why firm value is decreasing in insider excess control rights. THE Separation OF Ownership and control has long been recognized as the source of the agency problem between managers and shareholders at public corporations (Berle and Means (1932), Jensen and Meckling (1976)), and its shareholder-value ramification has been the subject of an extensive literature. Cash flow rights are largely aligned, recently some researchers have started to examine companies with alternative ownership schemes such as cross-holding, pyramidal, and dual-class structures. These alternative ownership arrange- ments, which are common in much of the world, often result in a significant divergence between insider voting rights and cash flow rights. This divergence aggravates the agency conflicts between managers and shareholders, since in- siders controlling dispro",

    "title": "Agency Problems in Public Firms:",
    "abstract": "This paper uses novel data to examine the ﬂeets of corporate jets operated by both publicly traded and privately held ﬁrms. In the cross-section, ﬁrms owned by private equity funds average 40% smaller ﬂeets than observably similar public ﬁrms. Similar ﬂeet reductions are observed within ﬁrms that undergo leveraged buyouts. Quantile regressions indicate that these results are driven by ﬁrms in the upper 30% of the conditional jet distribution. The results thus suggest that executives in a substantial minority of public ﬁrms enjoy excessive perquisite and compensation packages. Managers OF A FIRMmight sometimes take actions to beneﬁt themselves at the expense of the ﬁrm’s investors. Both ﬁrms and governments have put in place a variety of mechanisms to mitigate this agency problem, and a great deal there remains considerable debate as to whether further action should be taken to protect outside investors from self-interested managers. Debate over the desirability of reforming executive compensation arrange- ments is especially active. Some argue that executives exert too much control over their own compensation and often choose to pay themselves excessively (Yermack (1997), Bebchuk and Fried (2006), Morse, Nanda, and Seru (2011)), whereas others argue that observed compensation arrangements could rep- resent optimal contracts negotiated at arm’s length between ﬁrms and valu- able executive talent (Himmelberg and Hubbard (2000), Edmans, Gabaix, and Landier (2009), Gayle and Mill",

    "title": "Agency, Firm Growth, and Managerial Turnover",
    "abstract": "We study managerial incentive provision under moral hazard when growth opportu- nities arrive stochastically and pursuing them requires a change in management. A trade-off arises between the beneﬁt of always having the “right” manager and the cost of incentive provision. The prospect of growth-induced turnover limits the ﬁrm’s ability to rely on deferred pay, resulting in more front-loaded compensation. The opti- mal contract may insulate managers from the risk of growth-induced dismissal after periods of good performance. The evidence for the United States broadly supports the model’s predictions: Firms with better growth prospects experience higher CEO turnover and use more front-loaded compensation. When Ownership AND Control ARE Separated , ﬁrm performance depends cru- cially on having the right managers at the helm and incentivizing them prop- erly. Over time, changes in business conditions may call for a change in top management for the ﬁrm to seize new opportunities or overcome challenges. But this may complicate the task of incentivizing incumbent managers. For in- stance, if managers anticipate that their tenure at the ﬁrm will be short, they will be reluctant to accept any form of deferred compensation, a standard fea- ture of incentive contracts. The ﬁrm may therefore face a dilemma: By changing management to adapt to evolving business conditions, it may increase the costs of incentive provision. To analyze this tension, this paper introduces the idea of growth-ind",

    "abstract": "We examine the pricing of both aggregate jump and volatility risk in the cross-section of stock returns by constructing investable option trading strategies that load on one factor but are orthogonal to the other. Both aggregate jump and volatility risk help explain variation in expected returns. Consistent with theory, stocks with high sensi- tivities to jump and volatility risk have low expected returns. Both can be measured separately and are important economically, with a two-standard-deviation increase in jump (volatility) factor loadings associated with a 3.5% to 5.1% (2.7% to 2.9%) drop in expected annual stock returns. Aggregate Stock Market volatility varies over time. This has important im- plications for asset prices in the cross-section and is the subject of much re- jump risk is time-varying. For example, Bates (1991) shows that out-of-the- money puts became unusually expensive during the year preceding the crash of October 1987. His analysis reveals signiﬁcant time variation in the conditional expectations of jumps in aggregate stock market returns. Santa-Clara and Yan (2010) use option prices to calibrate a model in which both the volatility of the diffusion shocks and the intensity of the jumps are allowed to change over time. They likewise ﬁnd substantial time variation in the jump intensity pro- cess, with aggregate implied jump probabilities ranging from 0% to over 99%.

    "title": "Aggregate Risk and the Choice between Cash",
    "abstract": "Banks can create liquidity for ﬁrms by pooling their idiosyncratic risks. As a result, bank lines of credit to ﬁrms with greater aggregate risk should be costlier and such ﬁrms opt for cash in spite of the incurred liquidity premium. We ﬁnd empirical sup- port for this novel theoretical insight. Firms with higher beta have a higher ratio of cash to credit lines and face greater costs on their lines. In times of heightened ag- gregate volatility, banks exposed to undrawn credit lines become riskier; bank credit lines feature fewer initiations, higher spreads, and shorter maturity; and, ﬁrms’ cash reserves rise. A Federal Reserve SURVEYearlier this year found that about one-third of U.S. Banks have tightened their standards on loans they make to busi- nesses of all sizes. And about 45% of banks told the Fed that they are charging more for credit lines to large and midsize companies. Banks such as Citigroup Inc., which has been battered by billions of dollars in write-downs and other losses, are especially likely to play hardball, re- sisting pleas for more credit or pushing borrowers to pay more for loan modiﬁcations. How do ﬁrms manage their liquidity needs? This question has become in- tice.

    "abstract": "The literature has not established that a positive alpha, as traditionally measured, means that an investor would want to buy a fund. When alpha is deﬁned using the client’s utility function, a positive alpha generally means the client would want to buy. When markets are incomplete, investors will disagree about the attractiveness of a fund. We provide bounds on the expected disagreement with a traditional alpha and study the cross-sectional relation of disagreement and investor heterogeneity with the ﬂow response to past fund alphas. The effects are both economically and statistically signiﬁcant. Finance Researchers Have AN Easy familiarity with alpha, the most well- known measure of an investment’s abnormal return. Studies refer to Capital Asset Pricing Model (capm) alpha, three-factor alpha, or four-factor alpha, as- suming that the reader hardly requires a deﬁnition. Investment practitioners discuss their strategies in terms of the quest for alpha. Alpha can be active, conditional, or portable. The number of investment ﬁrms with alpha in their names is staggering. Despite this apparent familiarity with alpha, the current literature too often fails to think rigorously about how alphas can be interpreted. In this paper, we make three contributions to the literature. First, we offer extensions of existing results that motivate alpha as a guide to investment selection.

    "title": "Ambiguity, Information Quality,",
    "abstract": "When ambiguity-averse investors process news of uncertain quality, they act as if they take a worst-case assessment of quality. As a result, they react more strongly to bad news than to good news. They also dislike assets for which information quality is poor, especially when the underlying fundamentals are volatile. These effects induce ambiguity premia that depend on idiosyncratic risk in fundamentals as well as skew- ness in returns. Moreover, shocks to information quality can have persistent negative effects on prices even if fundamentals do not change. Financial Market Participants Absorb a large amount of news, or signals, every day. Processing a signal involves quality judgments: News from a reliable source should lead to more portfolio rebalancing than news from an obscure source. Unfortunately, judging quality itself is sometimes difficult. For example, stock picks from an unknown newsletter without a track record might be very reliable or entirely useless—it is simply hard to tell. Of course, the situation is different when investors can draw on a lot of experience that helps them interpret signals. This is true especially for “tangible” information, such as earnings reports, that lends itself to quantitative analysis. By looking at past data, investors may become quite confident about how well earnings forecast returns. This paper focuses on information processing when there is incomplete knowledge about signal quality. The main idea is that, when quality is diffi-",

    "abstract": "I study the effects of risk and ambiguity (Knightian uncertainty) on optimal portfolios and equilibrium asset prices when investors receive information that is difﬁcult to link to fundamentals. I show that the desire of investors to hedge ambiguity leads to portfolio inertia and excess volatility. Speciﬁcally, when news is surprising, investors frictions. Moreover, I show that small shocks to cash ﬂow news, asset betas, or mar- ket risk premia may lead to drastic changes in the stock price and hence to excess volatility. This Paper Studies THE effects of aversion to risk and ambiguity on optimal portfolios and equilibrium asset prices when investors receive public informa- tion about the value of an asset. Investors lack data or experience to process this new information and thus do not know the asset distribution when they condition on this information. I show that investors’ desire to hedge against ambiguity (i) leads to portfolio inertia for risky portfolios and (ii) generates excess volatility for asset prices. Investors face risk and ambiguity when they evaluate an investment in an asset because they know neither the future realization of the asset’s payoff (risk), nor the probability of it occurring (ambiguity).

    "abstract": "This study examines the determinants of mutual fund mergers and their sub- sequent wealth impact on shareholders of target and acquiring funds. Results in- dicate significant improvements in postmerger performance and a reduction in expense ratios for target fund shareholders. In contrast, acquiring fund share- holders experience a significant deterioration in postmerger performance. The net asset flows continue to remain negative for the combined fund in the year follow- ing the merger. The likelihood of a fund merger is inversely related to fund size for both within- and across-family mutual fund mergers. However, poor past perfor- mance is a significant determinant for only within-family mergers. This Paper Contributes to the growing literature on mutual fund organiza- tion and governance with an empirical examination of the determinants of mutual fund mergers and their subsequent impact on fund shareholders. Mergers among mutual funds are a relatively recent phenomenon, but given the dramatic growth in the fund industry, their emergence is not surprising. Rapid industry growth has increased the number of mutual funds, and merg- ers are one means of reducing what may be perceived as an excess supply.' In addition, the ongoing consolidation of the financial services industry has provided an incentive for firms to combine entire fund families, and reduce the number of fund offerings with similar objectives.

    "title": "An Anatomy of Commodity Futures Risk Premia",
    "abstract": "We identify two types of risk premia in commodity futures returns: spot premia re- lated to the risk in the underlying commodity, and term premia related to changes in the basis. Sorting on forecasting variables such as the futures basis, return mo- mentum, volatility, inﬂation, hedging pressure, and liquidity results in sizable spot premia between 5% and 14% per annum and term premia between 1% and 3% per annum. We show that a single factor, the high-minus-low portfolio from basis sorts, explains the cross-section of spot premia. Two additional basis factors are needed to explain the term premia. Futures Contracts ARE Zero-cost securities, that is, they do not require an initial investment. Hence, expected futures returns consist only of risk pre- mia. Understanding these premia is important, as they impact, for example, the hedging decisions of companies and the investment decisions of ﬁnancial institutions. The purpose of this paper is to characterize the cross-sectional and time-series variation in commodity futures risk premia.1 The cross-section of commodity futures risk premia has at least two dimensions. First, for each commodity there are multiple futures contracts that differ in time-to-maturity. Therefore, analogous to bonds, there is a term structure both of futures prices and of futures expected returns or risk premia. Second, like stocks, individual commodity futures differ on characteristics such as the sector to which they belong (e.g., Energy vs. Metals), as",

    "abstract": "Using a large database of analysts' target prices issued over the period 1997- 1999, we examine short-term market reactions to target price revisions and long-term comovement of target and stock prices. We find a significant market reaction to the information contained in analysts' target prices, both uncondi- tionally and conditional on contemporaneously issued stock recommendation and earnings forecast revisions. Using a cointegration approach, we analyze the long-term behavior of market and target prices. We find that, on average, the one-year-ahead target price is 28 percent higher than the current market price. Academics, Practitioners, AND Individual Investors have long been interested in un- derstanding the value and usefulness of sell-side analysts' equity reports. In re- cent years, security analysts have been increasingly disclosing target prices in these reports, along with their stock recommendations and earnings forecasts. These target prices provide market participants with analysts' most concise and explicit statement on the magnitude of the firm's expected value. Despite the in- creasing prominence of target prices, their role in conveying information to mar- ket participants and their contribution to the formation of equity prices have remained largely unexplored.'

    "abstract": "We test the theoretical equivalence of credit default swap (CDS) prices and credit spreads derived by Duffie (1999), finding support for the parity relation as an equi- librium condition. We also find two forms of deviation from parity. First, for three firms, CDS prices are substantially higher than credit spreads for long periods of time, arising from combinations of imperfections in the contract specification of CDSs and measurement errors in computing the credit spread. Second, we find short-lived deviations from parity for all other companies due to a lead for CDS prices over credit spreads in the price discovery process. Risky Corporate AND Sovereign Bonds are among the most recent securities to benefit from the trading of associated derivative contracts. This development has even drawn praise from Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan, in a November 19, 2002, speech before the Council on Foreign Relations.

    "abstract": "We use the information in collateralized debt obligations (CDO) prices to study market expectations about how corporate defaults cluster. A three-factor portfolio credit model explains virtually all of the time-series and cross-sectional variation in an extensive data set of CDX index tranche prices. Tranches are priced as if losses of 0.4%, 6%, and 35% of the portfolio occur with expected frequencies of 1.2, 41.5, and 763 years, respectively. On average, 65% of the CDX spread is due to firm-specific default risk, 27% to clustered industry or sector default risk, and 8% to catastrophic or systemic default risk. A Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO) is a financial claim to the cash flows generated by a portfolio of debt securities or, equivalently, a basket of credit default swaps (CDS contracts). Thus, CDOs are the credit market counterparts to the familiar collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) actively traded in secondary mortgage markets. Since its inception in the mid-1990s, the market for CDOs has become one of the most rapidly growing financial markets ever. Industry sources estimate the size of the CDO market at the end of 2006 to be nearly $2 trillion, representing more than a 30% increase over the prior year. 1 Recently, CDOs have been in the spotlight because of the May 2005 credit crisis in which downgrades of Ford’s and General Motors’ debt triggered a wave of large CDO losses among many credit-oriented hedge funds and Wall the Nber.

    "abstract": "This paper extends the class of stochastic volatility diffusions for asset returns to encompass Poisson jumps of time-varying intensity. We find that any reasonably descriptive continuous-time model for equity-index returns must allow for discrete jumps as well as stochastic volatility with a pronounced negative relationship be- tween return and volatility innovations. We also find that the dominant empirical characteristics of the return process appear to be priced by the option market. Our analysis indicates a general correspondence between the evidence extracted from daily equity-index returns and the stylized features of the corresponding options market prices. Much Asset AND Derivative Pricing Theory is based on diffusion models for primary securities. However, prescriptions for practical applications derived from these models typically produce disappointing results. A possible expla- nation could be that analytic formulas for pricing and hedging are available for only a limited set of continuous-time representations for asset returns and risk-free discount rates. It has become increasingly evident that such \"classical\" models fail to account adequately for the underlying dynamic evo- lution of asset prices and interest rates. Not surprisingly, the inadequacy of these specifications also shows up in bond and derivatives pricing, where the standard representations falter systematically.

We also find consistent evidence that our sample firms ex- perience significantly positive long-term abnormal operating performance following their R&D increases. Our findings suggest that R&D increases are beneficial invest- ments, and that the market is slow to recognize the extent of this benefit (consistent with investor underreaction).

    "title": "An Experimental Study of Bond Market Pricing",
    "abstract": "An important feature of bond markets is the relationship between the initial public offering (IPO) price and the probability that the issuer defaults. On the one hand, the default probability affects the IPO price; on the other hand, the IPO price affects the default probability. It is a priori unclear whether agents can competitively price experiments. We develop two ﬂexible bond market models that are easily implemented repetitions. NEW Assets ARE Often BROUGHTto market using an initial public offering (IPO). While a variety of studies analyze different IPO mechanisms, little is known about the impact of IPO prices on the subsequent ﬁnancial health of the com- pany issuing the new assets. The IPO price can, for example, affect the perfor- mance of an equity-issuing company through its effect on the funds available to the company for additional investments. Similarly, with new debt issues, the IPO price determines the ﬁnancing costs of the bond issuer and in turn affects the probability that the bond issuer is able (or willing) to meet new or preex- isting debt obligations. Such feedback effects from IPO prices to the real side of the economy and to the value of the assets themselves are often overlooked in the literature on asset pricing and are fully absent from the experimen- tal part of this literature. Our paper seeks to ﬁll this void by conducting the ﬁrst experimental study of assets with endogenous, price-dependent default probabilities. Comments and suggestions go t",

    "title": "An Explanation of Negative Swap Spreads:",
    "abstract": "The 30-year U.S. Swap spreads have been negative since September 2008. We offer a novel explanation for this persistent anomaly. Through an illustrative model, we show that underfunded pension plans optimally use swaps for duration hedging. Combined with dealer banks’ balance sheet constraints, this demand can drive swap spreads to become negative. Empirically, we construct a measure of the aggregate funding status of deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans and show that this measure helps explain 30-year swap spreads. We ﬁnd a similar link between pension funds’ underfunding and swap spreads for two other regions. IN September 2008, Shortly After THE default of Lehman Brothers, the differ- ence between the swap rate (which is the ﬁxed rate in the swap) of a 30-year in- terest rate swap (IRS) and the yield of a Treasury bond with the same maturity, commonly referred to as swap spread, dropped sharply and became negative. As we explain in more detail later, this is a theoretical arbitrage opportunity and an asset pricing anomaly. In contrast to other crisis phenomena, the 30- year negative swap spread has been highly persistent, still at around −40 basis points as of December 2015. In this paper, we examine the persistent negative 30-year swap spread and offer a new perspective on the possible reasons behind this anomaly. Our hypothesis is that demand for duration hedging by under- funded pension plans coupled with the balance sheet constraints faced by swap dealers put pressure on long-t",

    "title": "An Information-Based Theory of Time-Varying",
    "abstract": "We propose an information-based theory to explain time variation in liquidity and link it to a variety of patterns in asset markets. In “normal times,” the market is fully liquid and gains from trade are realized immediately. However, the equilibrium also involves periods during which liquidity “dries up,” which leads to endogenous liquidation costs. Traders correctly anticipate such costs, which reduces their willingness to pay. This foresight leads to a novel feedback effect between prices and market liquidity, which are jointly determined in equilibrium. The model also predicts that contagious sell-offs can occur after sufﬁciently bad news. Asset Markets ARE Susceptible to periods of illiquidity. Recent examples of this phenomenon include real estate (Clayton, MacKinnon, and Peng ( 2008)), mortgage-backed securities (Gorton ( 2009), Acharya and Schnabl ( 2010), Dwyer and Tkac ( 2009)), the repo market (Gorton and Metrick ( 2012)), struc- tured credit (Brunnermeier ( 2009)), commercial paper (Anderson and Gascon (2009)), and money market funds (Krishnamurthy, Nagel, and Orlov ( 2012)). In conjunction with this evidence, a literature has developed that exoge- nously speciﬁes time variation and risk in the ability to trade securities and then explores the implications for asset prices. Examples include Longstaff (2001, 2009), Acharya and Pedersen ( 2005), Watanabe and Watanabe ( 2008), Gˆarleanu ( 2009), and Ang, Papanikolaou, and Westerﬁeld ( 2014). Yet the un- derlying mech",

    "abstract": "This paper examines the relationship between the level of short interest and stock returns in the Nasdaq market from June 1988 through December 1994. We find that heavily shorted firms experience significant negative abnormal returns rang- ing from -0.76 to -1.13 percent per month after controlling for the market, size, book-to-market, and momentum factors. These negative returns increase with the level of short interest, indicating that a higher level of short interest is a stronger bearish signal. We find that heavily shorted firms are more likely to be delisted compared to their size, book-to-market, and momentum matched control firms. WE Investigate THE Relationship between the level of short interest and the stock returns in Nasdaq firms. Using monthly short interest data for the universe of Nasdaq firms from June 1988 to December 1994, we find that firms with a high level of short interest experience negative and significant abnormal returns when they are heavily shorted. Using a calendar-time port- folio approach, we regress monthly portfolio excess returns of stocks that had at least 2.5 percent short interest (number of shares sold short as a percentage of the shares outstanding) in the previous month on the three Fama and French (1993) risk factors and a fourth momentum factor (Car- hart (1997)). The regression yields negative and significant abnormal returns of -0.76 percent per month during our sample period. The magnitude of the negative abnormal returns increase",

    "title": "Analyst Coverage and Financing Decisions",
    "abstract": "We provide evidence that analyst coverage affects security issuance. First, firms cov- ered by fewer analysts are less likely to issue equity as opposed to debt. They issue equity less frequently, but when they do so, it is in larger amounts. Moreover, these firms depend more on favorable market conditions for their equity issuance decisions. Finally, debt ratios of less covered firms are more affected by Baker and Wurgler’s (2002) “external finance-weighted” average market-to-book ratio. These results are consistent with market timing behavior associated with information asymmetry, as well as behavior implied by dynamic adverse selection models of equity issuance. Empirical challenges of the Pecking Order Hypothesis (POH), historically one of the most influential theories of firms’ security issuance decisions. Frank and Goyal (2003b), for example, find that small firms, that is, those expected to be especially susceptible to information asymmetry problems, issue significant amounts of equity. The POH, however, suggests equity should be the financing of last resort for these firms. 1 More recently, Leary and Roberts (2004) explicitly test for the POH’s implied financial hierarchy between external and internal funds and debt versus equity. They find that firms appear to consistently violate this hierarchy. In fact, the theory performs particularly poorly in predicting equity issuance. The violation is especially significant for larger firms. Although information asymmetry is a",

    "abstract": "This paper documents a close link between mispricing and liquidity by investigating to be overpriced, but that prices correct downwards as uncertainty about earnings is resolved. Our analysis suggests that one reason mispricing has persisted through the years is that analyst disagreement coincides with high trading costs. We also show that in the cross-section, the less liquid stocks tend to be more severely overpriced. Additionally, increases in aggregate market liquidity accelerate the convergence of prices to fundamentals. As a result, returns of the initially overpriced stocks are negatively correlated with the time series of innovations in aggregate market liquidity. THE Finance Literature HAS Long Questioned whether mispricing can persist in a well-functioning economy. Friedman (1953) argues that prices must reflect fun- damental values because even if irrational investors misvalue a security, ratio- nal profit-seeking investors will trade against the mispricing, thereby pushing prices back to fundamentals. Others, however, show that prices may persis- tently diverge from their fundamental values when the trading costs exceed potential profits (see, for example, Shiller (1984), De Long et al. (1990), and Shleifer (2000)). The purpose of this paper is to show that mispricing is related to liquidity, particularly when the mistaken beliefs that cause the mispricing are expected to be corrected in the near future. This is because if the mispric- ing is expected to be short-",

    "abstract": "We show empirically that analysts who display more consistent forecast errors have greater ability to affect prices, and that this effect is larger than that of stated accu- racy . These results lead to three implications. First, consistent analysts are less likely to be demoted and are more likely to be nominated All Star analysts. Second, analysts strategically deliver downward-biased forecasts to increase their consistency (if at the expense of stated accuracy). Finally , the beneﬁts of consistency and of “lowballing” (accuracy) are increasing (decreasing) in institutional investors’ presence. Because OF THE Large demand for ﬁnancial analysts’ earnings forecasts, re- searchers have long been interested in how analyst forecast characteristics affect price formation and analysts’ career development. For example, prior studies examine the effect of analyst reputation and forecast bias on the vol- ume of trade generated by analyst forecasts (e.g.,Bailey et al. (2003), Jackson (2005)), as well as the role of herding (e.g.,Hong, Kubik, and Solomon (2000)) or optimism (Hong and Kubik (2003)) on labor market outcomes. The literature commonly uses forecast accuracy (the absolute distance between the forecast and realized earnings) to assess analysts’ performance. The general consensus is that accuracy matters. For example,Gu and Wu (2003)show that accuracy is one of the most important aspects of analyst forecast performance. Prior re- search also ﬁnds that more accurate analysts ha",

    "title": "Analysts’ Selective Coverage and Subsequent",
    "abstract": "This study examines the ability of analysts to forecast future firm performance, based on the selective coverage of newly public firms. We hypothesize that the decision to provide coverage contains information about an analyst’s underlying expectation of a firm’s future prospects. We extract this expectation by obtaining residual analyst coverage from a model of initial analyst following. We document that in the three sub- sequent years, initial public offerings with high residual coverage have significantly better returns and operating performance than those with low residual coverage. This evidence indicates analysts have superior predictive abilities and selectively provide coverage for firms about which their true expectations are favorable. Whether OR NOT Analysts Possess THE Ability to predict the future performance of firms is an important question for many investors that rely on the advice of analysts. To date, evidence for this predictive ability is mostly based upon analysis of analysts’ published forecasts and stock recommendations. Stickel (1995) and Womack (1996) find that positive (negative) changes in analysts’ investment recommendations are accompanied by positive (negative) abnor- mal returns around the announcement date, and Barber et al.

    "abstract": "We examine security analysts'career concerns by relating their earnings fore- casts to job separations. Relatively accurate forecasters are more likely to ex- perience favorable career outcomes like moving up to a high-status brokerage house. Controlling for accuracy, analysts who are optimistic relative to the consensus are more likely to experience favorable job separations. For ana- lysts who cover stocks underwritten by their houses, job separations depend less on accuracy and more on optimism. Job separations were less sensitive to accuracy and more sensitive to optimism during the recent stock market mania. Brokerage houses apparently reward optimistic analysts who promote stocks. Many IN THE Financial Press call the decade of the 1990s the \"Age of the Analysts\" on Wall Street (see Nocera (1997), Cole (2001)). Once relegated to producing bor- ing reports on stocks in the back rooms of brokerages, analysts are now an inte- gral part of Wall Street profit centers. Through media outlets such as Cnbc, analysts reach millions of individual investors. At the same time, investment bankers rely on analysts to help them land investment-banking deals. Analysts who are influential among institutional buyers such as mutual fund managers can generate hefty trading commissions for their brokerages. The growing prominence of these analysts in financial markets has led to heightened scrutiny of their career concerns. This scrutiny has recently reached a peak as well-known e-commerce an",

Na ¨ıve adherence to these recommendations can be costly, because thelevel of the consensus recommendation adds value only among stocks with favorable quantitative charac- teristics (i.e., value stocks and positive momentum stocks). In fact, among stocks with unfavorable quantitative characteristics, higher consensus recommendations are as- sociated with worse subsequent returns. In contrast, we find that the quarterlychange in consensus recommendations is a robust return predictor that appears to contain information orthogonal to a large range of other predictive variables. Financial Researchers AND Practitioners have long been interested in under- standing how the activities of financial analysts affect capital market efficiency.

    "title": "Analyzing the Tax Benefits from Employee",
    "abstract": "Employees tend to exercise stock options when corporate taxable income is high, shift- ing corporate tax deductions to years with higher tax rates. If firms paid employees the same dollar value in wages instead of stock options, the average annual tax bill for large U.S. Companies would increase by $12.6 million, or 9.8%. These direct tax benefits of options increase in the convexity of the tax function. In addition, profitable firms can realize indirect tax benefits because stock options increase debt capacity. Although tax minimization is probably not the main motive for option grants, firms with larger potential tax benefits grant more options. This Paper Analyzes the corporate tax implications of using employee stock op- tions versus fixed compensation. A firm’s compensation structure matters from a tax perspective because stock options tend to shift tax deductions to more prof- itable years, where marginal corporate tax rates tend to be higher. 1 In contrast, compensating employees with contractually specified fixed wages provides a uniform tax deduction regardless of the firm’s profitability. We focus on the effects of compensation choice on average tax savings and debt policy for S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 firms in the period 2000–2005. Understanding the tax implications of employee stock options has become es- sential following the tremendous growth in stock-based compensation over the past decade.

    "title": "Anchoring on Credit Spreads",
    "abstract": "This paper documents that thepath of credit spreads since a ﬁrm’s last loan inﬂu- ences thelevel at which it can currently borrow. If spreads have moved in the ﬁrm’s favor (i.e., declined), it is charged a higher interest rate than is justiﬁed by current fundamentals, whereas if spreads have moved to the ﬁrm’s detriment, it is charged a lower rate. We evaluate several possible explanations for this ﬁnding, and conclude that anchoring to past deal terms is most plausible. Virtually ALL Borrowers PAYa spread above the risk-free rate, a premium that compensates lenders for expected losses in default, illiquidity, and other con- siderations. Calculating the appropriate spread requires answering a number of questions. How likely is the ﬁrm to default, and over what horizon? If it does default, how big are the losses? Is default more likely to occur in bad economic times, or is it largely dependent on ﬁrm-speciﬁc factors? How easy will it be to sell the ﬁrm’s bonds or bank notes, and will this be more difﬁcult during certain economic states? The common element to these questions is their perspective: they are all forward-looking. Retrospective information is thought to be relevant only to the extent that it improves the lender’s estimate of forward-looking variables, data that are purely historical, in the sense that they do not provide informa- tion about the ﬁrm’s creditworthiness, should not affect spreads.

    "title": "Anomalies and News",
    "abstract": "Using a sample of 97 stock return anomalies, we ﬁnd that anomaly returns are 50% higher on corporate news days and six times higher on earnings announcement days. These results could be explained by dynamic risk, mispricing due to biased expecta- tions, or data mining. We develop and conduct several unique tests to differentiate between these three explanations. Our results are most consistent with the idea that anomaly returns are driven by biased expectations, which are at least partly corrected upon news arrival. Istics can predict the cross-section of stock returns (see Fama (1998), Nagel to at least Ball and Brown (1968) and Blume and Husic (1973), yet more than four decades later, academics still disagree on what causes this return pre- dictability. There are three popular explanations for cross-sectional predictability. First, return predictability could be a result of cross-sectional differences in risk, which are reﬂected in discount rates (e.g., Fama (1991, 1998)). Under this ex- planation, cross-sectional return predictability is expected because return dif- ferences reﬂect ex ante differences in the discount rates used to value the stocks. Second, return predictability could reﬂect mispricing (e.g., Barberis and Thaler (2003)). For example, the marginal investor may have biased ex- pectations about cash ﬂows, and the anomaly variables are correlated with disclose.

    "abstract": "We provide the ﬁrst systematic evidence on the link between long-short anomaly portfolio returns—a cornerstone of the cross-sectional literature—and the time- series predictability of the aggregate market excess return. Using 100 representa- tive anomalies from the literature, we employ a variety of shrinkage techniques (including machine learning, forecast combination, and dimension reduction) to ef- ﬁciently extract predictive signals in a high-dimensional setting. We ﬁnd that long- short anomaly portfolio returns evince statistically and economically signiﬁcant out- of-sample predictive ability for the market excess return. The predictive ability of anomaly portfolio returns appears to stem from asymmetric limits of arbitrage and overpricing correction persistence.

    "abstract": "We examine the timing of returns around the publication of anomaly trading signals. Using a database that captures when information is ﬁrst publicly released, we show that anomaly returns are concentrated in the ﬁrst month after information release dates, and these returns decay soon thereafter. We also show that the academic con- vention of forming portfolios in June underestimates predictability because it uses stale information, which makes some anomalies appear insigniﬁcant. In contrast, we show many anomalies do predict returns if portfolios are formed immediately after information releases. Finally, we develop guidance on forming portfolios without us- ing stale information. IN Informationally Efficient Capital Markets , investors compete to proﬁt from asset-pricing anomalies before mispricing is arbitraged away. This competition creates a race to acquire and process information quickly, and this race begins as soon as information about an anomaly signal becomes public. Yet despite the importance of the timing of information releases for anomaly strategies, the academic literature largely ignores when anomaly returns occur and when they are arbitraged away.

    "abstract": "In this paper, I explore a reform at the Oslo Stock Exchange to assess the causal effect of posttrade trader anonymity on stock liquidity and trading volume. Using a regression discontinuity approach, I ﬁnd that anonymity leads to a reduction in bid-ask spreads of 40% and an increase in trading volume of more than 50%. The increase in trading volume is accounted for largely by increased trading activity by institutional investors, while retail investors do not adjust their trading behavior in response to anonymity. The results suggest that posttrade anonymity positively affects standard measures of market quality. Stock Exchanges Continually ﬁne-tune their markets to promote liquid- ity. A much-used strategy over the last decade has been to alter the degree to which traders are anonymous. In this paper, I empirically assess the effect of posttrade anonymity—the concealment of trader identities after completed trades—on stock liquidity and trading volume. An anonymity reform at the Oslo Stock Exchange (OSE) allows for causal inference. I ﬁnd that posttrade anonymity increases stock liquidity and trading volume. The increase in trad- ing volume is accounted for largely by increased trading activity by institu- tional investors, while retail investors do not adjust their trading behavior in response to anonymity.

    "abstract": "This paper presents the first model where entry deterrence takes place through financial rather than product-market channels. In existing models, a firm's choice of financial instruments deters entry by affecting product market behavior; here entry deterrence occurs by affecting the credit market behavior of investors towards entrant firms. We find that to deter entry, the claims held on incumbent firms should be sufficiently risky, that is, equity. This contrasts with the standard Brander and Lewis (1986) result that debt deters entry. This effect is more marked the less competitive the credit market is-so more credit market competition spurs more product market competition. The difficulties inherent in acquiring external finance in the United States in the nineteenth century provide an explanation for the basis of the for- tunes of certain American entrepreneurs and suggest at least one reason why the economy was characterized by increasing concentration in the growth sectors. -Lance Davis (1966, p. 272) This Paper Presents THE First Model in which entry deterrence takes place through financial rather than product-market channels.

Combining this arbitrage asymmetry with the arbitrage risk represented by idiosyncratic volatility (ivol) ex- plains the negative relation between Ivol and average return. The IVOL-return relation is negative among overpriced stocks but positive among underpriced stocks, with mispricing determined by combining 11 return anomalies. Consistent with arbi- trage asymmetry, the negative relation among overpriced stocks is stronger, especially for stocks less easily shorted, so the overall IVOL-return relation is negative. Further supporting our explanation, high investor sentiment weakens the positive relation among underpriced stocks and, especially, strengthens the negative relation among overpriced stocks. Does A Stock ’S Expected return depend on “idiosyncratic” volatility that does not arise from systematic risk factors? This question has been investigated empirically since virtually the inception of classical asset pricing theory. Earlier empirical investigations often ﬁnd no relation, consistent with classical theory, or ﬁnd a positive relation between expected return and idiosyncratic volatility et al. ( 2006), instead tends to ﬁnd a negative relation between expected return Pennsylvania.

    "title": "Arbitraging Arbitrageurs",
    "abstract": "This paper develops a theory of strategic trading in markets with large arbitrageurs. If arbitrageurs are not well capitalized, capital constraints make their trades pre- dictable. Other market participants can exploit this by trading against them. Com- petitors may find it optimal to lend to arbitrageurs that are financially fragile; addi- tional capital makes the arbitrageurs more viable, and lenders can reap profits from trading against them for a longer time. The strategic behavior of these market partici- pants has implications for the functioning of financial markets. Strategic trading may produce significant price distortions, increase price manipulation, and trigger forced liquidations of large traders. IN Many Financial AND Commodity Markets a few large players account for a signif- icant fraction of the trading volume. These large players are often arbitrageurs because their primary activity involves taking large positions to profit from small mispricings. The presence of large players is usually well known to market participants. In some cases this is the result of reputation built over time. Examples include Yasuo Hamanaka, the Sumitomo trader once known as “Mr. Five Percent” among copper traders to reflect its holdings of 5% of the total copper market; Long-Term Capital Management (ltcm), which was referred to as the “Cen- tral Bank of Volatility” because of its large short positions in equity derivatives; Metallgesellschaft, which was known as the largest “Wall",

    "abstract": "Agency theory and optimal contracting theory posit opposing roles and shareholder wealth effects for corporate inside directors. We evaluate these theories using the market for outside directorships to differentiate among inside directors. Firms with inside directors holding outside directorships have better operating performance and market-to-book ratios, especially when monitoring is more difﬁcult. These ﬁrms make better acquisition decisions, have greater cash holdings, and overstate earnings less often. Announcements of outside board appointments improve shareholder wealth, while departure announcements reduce it, consistent with these inside directors im- proving board performance and outside directorships being an important source of inside director incentives. THE Board OF Directors ISa critical corporate governance mechanism, yet our knowledge of what makes boards effective is quite limited. In this study, we explore the roles of inside directors. Fama and Jensen (1983) theorize that internal managers are the most inﬂuential board members due to their valu- the important roles non-CEO executives play from several perspectives. Ra- heja (2005), Adams and Ferreira (2007), and Harris and Raviv (2008) show that inside directors are valuable in enhancing a board’s advisory and monitor- ing functions, while Acharya, Meyers, and Rajan (2009) show that inﬂuential inside directors can be valuable when CEOs are less entrenched.

    "abstract": "Initial yields on both AAA-rated and non-AAA rated mortgage-backed security (MBS) tranches sold by large issuers are higher than yields on similar tranches sold by small issuers during the market boom years of 2004 to 2006. Moreover, the prices of MBS sold by large issuers drop more than those sold by small issuers, and the differences are concentrated among tranches issued during 2004 to 2006. These results suggest that investors price the risk that large issuers received more inﬂated ratings than small issuers, especially during boom periods. AS THE Most Severe ﬁnancial and economic crisis since the Great Depression unfolds, scholars, practitioners, and regulators have been studying its causes crisis is the growth of the mortgage-backed securities (MBS) market, which both fueled and was fueled by the housing market boom. In this paper, we study the role of the three main rating agencies—Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s (S&P), and Fitch—in the expansion of the MBS market. We test whether conﬂicts of interest may have played a role in the growth of MBS, and whether the market priced plausible measures of the intensity of conﬂicts related to issuer size and regulatory status. Rating agencies play an important role in ﬁxed income securities markets, in part because they have access to private information.

Trade ideas based on expectations of future events are more informative than those identifying incomplete incorporation of past information in stock prices. Analysts with better access to a ﬁrm’s management produce better trade ideas. Insti- tutional investors trade in the direction of trade ideas. Investors following trade ideas can earn signiﬁcant abnormal returns, consistent with analysts possessing valuable short-term stock-picking skills. ON November 26, 2012, THE analyst following the common stock of Bank of America (BAC) at Guggenheim Securities made a tactical trading call suggest- ing that investors sell BAC over the next three months based on his expecta- tion of the impact on BAC of the U.S. Economy being pushed over ﬁscal cliffs. At the same time, the analyst reiterated his buy recommendation on BAC over a 12-month period based on his long-term investment thesis. Although the literature has raised concerns about analysts speaking with two tongues (e.g., Malmendier and Shantikumar ( 2014)), here we have an analyst issuing a trad- ing sell on BAC for the near term even though he considers it a buy for the long term.1 Issuing diverging stock opinions across different investment horizons is an accepted practice by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (finra), the self-regulatory organizatio",

Using newswire- reported time stamps, we ﬁnd 30-minute returns of 1.83% (−2.10%) for upgrades (downgrades), but for this subset of recommendations we ﬁnd corresponding returns of −0.07% (−0.09%) using I/B/E/S-reported time stamps.

    "abstract": "Secondary market trading in loans elicits a signiﬁcant positive stock price response by a borrowing ﬁrm’s equity investors. We ﬁnd the major reason for this response is the alleviation of borrowing ﬁrms’ ﬁnancial constraints. We also ﬁnd that new loan announcements are associated with a positive stock price effect even when prior loans made to the same borrower already trade on the secondary market. We conclude that the special role of banks has changed due to their ability to create an active secondary loan market while simultaneously maintaining their traditional role as information producers. IT IS Commonly Argued that banks play a special role in the ﬁnancial system because they resolve important information asymmetries. Theoretical models (e.g., Diamond (1984), Ramakrishnan and Thakor (1984), Fama (1985))h i g h - light the unique monitoring functions of banks, and show that banks have a comparative advantage, as well as enhanced incentives (relative to public debt holders), in monitoring debt contracts. However, the recent development of an active secondary market for loans could potentially diminish or signiﬁcantly alter this special role.1 This study analyzes whether the development of the secondary market for bank loans has changed the special role of banks in the ﬁnancial system, and if so, how.

    "abstract": "We study the design of credit default swaps (CDS) auctions, which determine the payments by CDS sellers to CDS buyers following defaults of bonds. Using a simple model, we ﬁnd that the current design of CDS auctions leads to biased prices and inefﬁcient allocations. This is because various restrictions imposed in CDS auctions prevent certain investors from participating in the price discovery and allocation process. The imposition of a price cap or ﬂoor also gives dealers large inﬂuence on the ﬁnal auction price. We propose an alternative double auction design that delivers more efﬁcient price discovery and allocations.

    "title": "Are CEOs Different?",
    "abstract": "Using 2,603 executive assessments, we study how CEO candidates differ from can- didates for other top management positions, particularly CFOs. More than half of the variation in the 30 assessed characteristics is explained by four factors that we interpret as general ability, execution (vs. Interpersonal), charisma (vs. Analytical), and strategic (vs. Managerial). CEO candidates have more extreme factor scores that differ signiﬁcantly from those of CFO candidates. Conditional on being considered, candidates with greater general ability and interpersonal skills are more likely to be hired. These and our previous results on CEO success suggest that boards overweight interpersonal skills in hiring CEOs. Many Executives Aspire TO Become CEOs. At the same time, perhaps the most important job of a board of directors is to choose an effective CEO. Yet little is known about the characteristics of executives who become CEO can- didates, how CEOs differ from other top managers, and how boards choose a CEO from among those candidates. Kaplan, Klebanov, and Sorensen (2012, henceforth KKS) use personality assessments of 316 CEO candidates to study determinants of CEO success. In this study, we use a substantially larger sam- ple that contains 2,603 assessments to further characterize top managers. Our analysis complements and extends KKS in four ways. First, using the larger sample, we identify four intuitive factors—two of which are new—that explain much of the variation in the candidate",

    "abstract": "Focusing on the one-off tax gains and losses (i.e., windfalls) associated with the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we reexamine whether CEOs are rewarded for luck. We ﬁnd that weakly monitored CEOs are compensated for the windfall tax gains but not penalized for the corresponding tax losses. No such pattern is observed for CEOs facing greater pay scrutiny. The pay for windfalls cannot be explained as rewards for CEOs’ efforts, talents, political activities, or as ﬁrms sharing their tax gains with all executives. The results are more consistent with rent extraction by CEOs facing weak pay scrutiny. DO Executives Receive Compensation FOR windfall gains that are unre- lated to their efforts? While traditional optimal contracting theories suggest that managers are compensated only for their efforts and not for gains arising out of luck, an alternative rent-extraction model suggests that CEOs, espe- cially those with weak pay scrutiny, are paid for gains due to factors beyond suggestions, we thank Antoinette Schoar (Editor), an anonymous Associate Editor, two anony- mous reviewers, Ana Albuquerque, Ahmed Abdalla, Eric Allen, James Chyz, Patricia Dechow , Emmanuel De George, Scott Dyreng, Alex Edmans, Fabrizio Ferri, José Elias Feres de Almeida, Kurt Gee, John Heater, Anthony Joffre, Christo Karuna, Clive Lennox, Andrew Leone, Chris- tine Liu, Mark Maffett, William Mayew , Dhananjay Nanda, Scott Pickett, Hojun Seo, Bridget thank Claudia Custódio for sharing updated data on CEOs’ genera",

    "abstract": "A commonly held view in corporate finance is that firms are less leveraged than they should be, given the potentially large tax benefits of debt. In this paper, I study the effect of firms’ leverage on default probabilities as represented by the firms’ ratings. Using an instrumental variable approach, I find that the leverage’s effect on ratings is three times stronger than it is if the endogeneity of leverage is ignored. This stronger effect results in a higher impact of leverage on the ex ante costs of financial distress, which can offset the current estimates of the tax benefits of debt. Ever Since Modigliani AND Miller (1963), A central question in corporate finance asks why, if debt provides a large tax advantage, do firms not use debt more intensively?1 Graham (2000) finds that by leveraging up to the point at which the marginal tax benefits begin to decline, a typical firm could add 7.5% to firm value, after netting out the personal tax penalty. So why are firms not more leveraged? According to the traditional trade-off theory of capital structure, the (ex ante) costs of financial distress should offset the benefits of the tax shields.

    "abstract": "Combining data on brokerage commissions that mutual fund families paid for trade execution between 1996 and 1999 with data on mutual fund holdings of initial pub- lic offerings (IPOs), I document a robust, positive correlation between commissions paid to lead underwriters and reported holdings of the IPOs they underwrite. More- over, I find that the correlation is limited to IPOs with nonnegative first-day returns and strongest for IPOs that occur shortly before mutual funds report their holdings, when the noise introduced by flipping is smallest. Overall, the evidence suggests that business relationships with lead underwriters increase investor access to underpriced IPOs. During THE HOT Initial Public Offering Market OF THE Late 1990S, the typical ini- tial public offering (IPO) was significantly underpriced and oversubscribed, and the first-day returns earned by investors in these IPOs received considerable public attention. 1 The source of these first-day returns and related questions an anonymous referee, Reena Aggarwal, Daniel Bergstresser, Walid Busaba, John Chalmers, Randy Cohen, Diane Del Guercio, Glenn Ellison, Wayne Ferson, Denis Gromb, Dirk Jenter, Jonathan Lewellen, Alexander Ljungqvist, Tim Loughran, Robin McKnight, Wayne Mikkelson, Stew Myers, Eddie O’Neal, Megan Partch, Jeffrey Pontiff, Jay Ritter, Jorge Rodriguez, Antoinette Schoar, Donghang Zhang, individuals within the mutual fund and underwriting communities, and seminar and Initial Public Offerings, the 20",

    "title": "Are Incentive Contracts Rigged by Powerful",
    "abstract": "We argue that some powerful CEOs induce boards to shift the weight on performance measures toward the better performing measures, therebyrigging incentive pay. A simple model formalizes this intuition and gives an explicit structural form on the rigged incentive portion of CEO wage function. Using U.S. Data, we ﬁnd support for the model’s predictions: rigging accounts for at least 10% of the compensation to performance sensitivity and it increases with CEO human capital and ﬁrm volatility. Moreover, a ﬁrm with rigged incentive pay that is one standard deviation above the mean faces a subsequent decrease of 4.8% in ﬁrm value and 7.5% in operating return on assets. Incentive Contracts ARE generally thought to be one of the cornerstones of corporate governance available to a board to align managers’ interests with those of shareholders (e.g., Holmstrom (1979)). Such contracting may be espe- cially important to induce CEOs to maximize shareholder value when agency problems are severe (Eaton and Rosen (1983)). In this paper, we cast a neg- ative light on the extent to which incentive contracting can counter agency problems and substitute for good governance arrangements. We argue that, when a board is relatively weak, incentive contracting may itself become a source of shareholder value leakage. In particular, we explore the possibility of CEOs inﬂuencing their incentive pay by manipulating the manner in which performance is measured. The intuition is straightforward. Boards use a",

    "abstract": "S&P 500 index funds represent one of the simplest vehicles for examining rational behavior. They hold virtually the same securities, yet their returns differ by more than 2 percent per year. Although the relative returns of alternative S&P 500 funds are easily predictable, the relationship between cash flows and performance is weaker than rational behavior would lead us to expect. We show that selecting funds based on low expenses or high past returns outperforms the portfolio of index funds selected by investors. Our results exemplify the fact that, in a market where arbitrage is not possible, dominated products can prosper. THE Classic Paradigm OF Financial Theory assumes that investors operating in frictionless markets make rational decisions. Under this paradigm, rational investors set prices, and their actions lead to the elimination of dominated fi- nancial investments. Since S&P 500 index funds are a commodity that differ from each other principally in price, they represent one of the simplest vehicles for examining investor rationality under the assumption of frictionless markets. Although all of these funds hold the same securities in virtually identical per- centages, they have substantial differences in fees and returns that investors should find economically significant. For example, the difference in annual re- turn between the best performing and worst performing S&P 500 index fund is 2.09 percent per year. In this paper, we show that the differences in future r",

    "title": "Are Judgment Errors Reflected in Market Prices",
    "abstract": "The question of whether individual judgment errors survive in market equilibrium is an issue that naturally lends itself to experimental analysis. Here, the Monty Hall problem is used to detect probability judgment errors both in a cohort of individuals and in a market setting. When all subjects in a cohort made probability judgment errors, market prices also reflected the error. However, competition among two bias- free subjects was sufficient to drive prices to error-free levels. Thus, heterogeneity in behavior can be an important factor in asset pricing, and further, it may take few bias-free traders to make asset prices bias-free. IN Recent Years, behavioral researchers have challenged the joint hypotheses of efficient markets and the idea that average (excess) returns are solely rewards for risk, suggesting that these are deficient for interpreting capital market data (De Bondt and Thaler (1985), Shleifer (2000), Hirshleifer (2001)). They argue that individual cognitive errors are useful in interpreting marketwide anoma- lies, presupposing that individual judgment errors aggregate into similar mar- ketwide errors. Other researchers instead maintain that individual judgment errors do not materially affect markets in equilibrium. Rubinstein (2001, p. 26) summarizes: “Some adherents of behavioral finance begin sensibly enough with the results of convincing experiments that show human beings are irrational in certain specific systemic ways.

    "abstract": "We provide a comprehensive empirical analysis of the effects of liquidity and informa- tion risks on expected returns of Treasury bonds. We focus on the systematic liquidity risk of Pastor and Stambaugh as opposed to the traditional microstructure-based measures of liquidity. Information risk is measured by the probability of information- based trading (PIN). We document a strong positive relation between expected Trea- sury returns and liquidity and information risks, controlling for the effects of other systematic risk factors and bond characteristics. This relation is robust to many em- pirical specifications and a wide variety of traditional liquidity and informed trading proxies. THE Importance OF Liquidity and information risks for asset pricing has been increasingly recognized in the literature. For example, in her 2003 American Finance Association presidential address, O’Hara (2003, p. 1335) argues that, “Markets have two important functions—liquidity and price discovery—and these functions are important for asset pricing.” She also suggests that standard asset pricing models fail to adequately capture asset price behavior because they assume that the underlying problems of liquidity and price discovery have been resolved. Recent attempts to incorporate liquidity and information risk factors into as- set pricing models have generated important insights into asset price behavior. In an influential study, Pastor and Stambaugh (2003) show that marketwide liquidity is a s",

    "title": "Are Momentum Profits Robust",
    "abstract": "We test whether momentum strategies remain profitable after considering market frictions induced by trading. Intraday data are used to estimate alternative measures of proportional and non-proportional (price impact) trading costs. The price impact models imply that abnormal returns to portfolio strategies decline with portfolio size. We calculate break-even fund sizes that lead to zero abnormal returns. In addition to equal- and value-weighted momentum strategies, we derive a liquidity-weighted strategy designed to reduce the cost of trades. Equal-weighted strategies perform the best before trading costs and the worst after trading costs. Liquidity-weighted and hybrid liquidity/value-weighted strategies have the largest break-even fund sizes: $5 billion or more (relative to December 1999 market capitalization) may be invested in these momentum strategies before the apparent profit opportunities vanish. There IS A Growing Literature on the predictability of stock returns based on the information contained in past returns. At very short horizons, such as a week or a month, returns are shown to have negative serial correlation (rever- sal), while at 3 to 12 month horizons, they exhibit positive serial correlation (momentum). During longer horizons, such as 3 to 5 years, stock returns again exhibit reversals. 1 The momentum of individual stocks is extensively examined by Jegadeesh and Titman (1993, 2001). They show that one can obtain superior returns by holding a zero-cost port",

    "abstract": "American options on the S&P 500 index futures that violate the stochastic domi- nance bounds of Constantinides and Perrakis (2009) from 1983 to 2006 are identiﬁed as potentially proﬁtable trades. Call bid prices more frequently violate their upper bound than put bid prices do, while violations of the lower bounds by ask prices are infrequent. In out-of-sample tests of stochastic dominance, the writing of options that violate the upper bound increases the expected utility of any risk-averse investor holding the market and cash, net of transaction costs and bid-ask spreads. The results are economically signiﬁcant and robust. WE Identify American call and put options on the S&P 500 index futures from 1983 to 2006 that violate the stochastic dominance upper bounds of Constantinides and Perrakis (2007) as potentially proﬁtable investment opportunities—“good sell” options. We then consider the utility enhancement that obtains from exploiting such violations by adopting the appropriate trad- ing policy for a generic investor who holds only the market index and the risk- free asset. In the identiﬁcation of both the violations and the trading policy, we recognize the potential early exercise of these American options. We allow for realistic trading conditions by using only observable information and by incor- porating transaction costs, bid-ask spreads, and trading delays (by waiting one quote before entering the position).

    "abstract": "Previous empirical work on adverse consequences of CEO overconﬁdence raises the reason: overconﬁdence can beneﬁt shareholders by increasing investment in risky projects. Using options- and press-based proxies for CEO overconﬁdence, we ﬁnd that over the 1993–2003 period, ﬁrms with overconﬁdent CEOs have greater return volatility, invest more in innovation, obtain more patents and patent citations, and However, overconﬁdent managers achieve greater innovation only in innovative in- dustries. Our ﬁndings suggest that overconﬁdence helps CEOs exploit innovative growth opportunities. Steve Jobs , Former CEO of Apple Computers, was ranked by Business- Week as one of the greatest innovators of the last 75 years in a 2004 article—written before Apple’s introduction of the path-breaking iPhone and iPad—because “More than anyone else, Apple’s co-founder has brought digital technology to the masses.” Jobs is almost as famous for his self-conﬁdence.

    "title": "Are Stocks Really Less Volatile in the Long Run?",
    "abstract": "According to conventional wisdom, annualized volatility of stock returns is lower over long horizons than over short horizons, due to mean reversion induced by return pre- dictability. In contrast, we ﬁnd that stocks are substantially more volatile over long horizons from an investor’s perspective. This perspective recognizes that parameters are uncertain, even with two centuries of data, and that observable predictors imper- fectly deliver the conditional expected return. Mean reversion contributes strongly to reducing long-horizon variance but is more than offset by various uncertainties faced by the investor. The same uncertainties reduce desired stock allocations of long-horizon investors contemplating target-date funds. Conventional Wisdom Views STOCKreturns as less volatile over longer invest- ment horizons. This view seems consistent with various empirical estimates. For example, using two centuries of U.S. Equity returns,Siegel (2008)reports that variances realized over investment horizons of several decades are sub- stantially lower than short-horizon variances on a per-year basis. Such evi- dence pertains to unconditional variance, but a similar message is delivered by studies that condition variance on information useful in predicting returns. Campbell and Viceira (2002, 2005), for example, report estimates of conditional variances that decrease with the investment horizon. We ﬁnd that stocks are actuallymore volatile over long horizons from an investor’s perspecti",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the role of disagreement in amplifying housing cycles. Speculation is easier in the land market than in the housing market due to frictions that make renting less efﬁcient than owner-occupancy. As a result, undeveloped land facilitates construction and intensiﬁes the speculation that causes booms and busts in house prices. This observation challenges the standard intuition that in cities where con- struction is easier, house price booms are smaller. It can also explain why the largest house price booms in the United States between 2000 and 2006 occurred in areas with elastic housing supply. Asset Prices GO Through Periods of sustained price increases, followed by busts. To explain these episodes, economists have developed theories based on disagreement, speculation, and strategic trading. This literature focuses on the behavior of asset prices in stock markets. But do these ideas explain housing markets as well? Like any other ﬁnancial asset, housing is a traded, durable claim on uncertain dividends. Moreover, an enduring feature of housing mar- kets is booms and busts in prices that coincide with widespread disagreement about fundamentals (Shiller (2005)), and there is a long history of investors using real estate to speculate about the economy (Kindleberger (1978), Glaeser (2013)). In this paper, we incorporate disagreement into a housing model to exam- ine whether the ﬁnding that disagreement raises stock prices generalizes to Chicago and Nber. We thank",

    "abstract": "We document an unprecedented brain drain of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) professors from universities from 2004 to 2018. We ﬁnd that students from the affected uni- versities establish fewer AI startups and raise less funding. The brain-drain effect is signiﬁcant for tenured professors, professors from top universities, and deep-learning professors. Additional evidence suggests that unobserved city- and university-level shocks are unlikely to drive our results. We consider several economic channels for the ﬁndings. The most consistent explanation is that professors’ departures reduce startup founders’ AI knowledge, which we ﬁnd is an important factor for successful startup formation and fundraising. Startups AND Entrepreneurship ARE Important for innovation, employment, and economic growth (e.g., Schumpeter (1942), King and Levine (1993)).

    "title": "Asset Allocation in Bankruptcy",
    "abstract": "This paper investigates the consequences of liquidation and reorganization on the allocation and subsequent utilization of assets in bankruptcy. Using the random as- signment of judges to bankruptcy cases as a natural experiment that forces some ﬁrms into liquidation, we ﬁnd that the long-run utilization of assets of liquidated ﬁrms is lower relative to assets of reorganized ﬁrms. These effects are concentrated in thin markets with few potential users and in areas with low access to ﬁnance. These ﬁndings suggest that when search frictions are large, liquidation can lead to inefﬁcient allocation of assets in bankruptcy. Declining Industries, Insolvency, AND Distressed ﬁrms are unavoidable con- sequences of an evolving economy. The ability of an economy to subsequently direct assets to better uses has important implications for productivity and the speed of recovery following adverse economic shocks (Eisfeldt and Rampini (2006), Hsieh and Klenow (2009), Bartelsman, Haltiwanger, and Scarpetta (2013)). Since economies rely on courts to resolve insolvency, bankruptcy in- stitutions play an important role in allocating the assets of distressed ﬁrms. Broadly speaking, bankruptcy is resolved through two approaches: liquida- tion and reorganization (Hart (2000), Str¨omberg (2000), Djankov et al. (2008)). While liquidation involves winding down the ﬁrm and putting all ﬁrm assets back on the market, reorganization aims at rehabilitating the company when- ever possible. Despite the impor",

    "abstract": "We identify a new channel for the transmission of shocks across international mar- kets. Investor ﬂows to funds domiciled in developed markets force signiﬁcant changes in these funds’ emerging market portfolio allocations. These forced trades or “ﬁre sales” affect emerging market equity prices, correlations, and betas, and are related to but distinct from effects arising purely from fund holdings or from overlapping own- ership of emerging markets in fund portfolios. A simple model and calibration exercise highlight the importance to these ﬁndings of “push” effects from funds’ domicile coun- tries and “co-ownership spillover” between markets with overlapping fund ownership.

These questions need to be answered to predict how crises are likely to spread across markets, or to correctly evaluate the beneﬁts of international portfolio diversiﬁcation. Correlated changes in fundamentals such as macroeconomic variables are an important part of the explanation, but are insufﬁcient to explain the full magnitude and variation in international return co-movement.

    "title": "Asset Float and Speculative Bubbles",
    "abstract": "We model the relationship between asset float (tradeable shares) and speculative bub- bles. Investors with heterogeneous beliefs and short-sales constraints trade a stock with limited float because of insider lockups. A bubble arises as price overweighs op- timists’ beliefs and investors anticipate the option to resell to those with even higher valuations. The bubble’s size depends on float as investors anticipate an increase in float with lockup expirations and speculate over the degree of insider selling. Consis- tent with the internet experience, the bubble, turnover, and volatility decrease with float and prices drop on the lockup expiration date. THE Behavior OF Internet Stock Prices during the late 1990s was extraordinary. On February of 2000, this largely profitless sector of roughly 400 companies commanded valuations that represented 6% of the market capitalization and an astounding 20% of the publicly traded volume of the U.S. Stock market (see, e.g., Ofek and Richardson (2003)). 1 These and similar figures led many to believe that this set of stocks was in the midst of an asset price bubble. In turn, the valuations of these stocks began to collapse shortly thereafter and by the end of the same year, they had returned to pre-1998 levels, losing nearly 70% from the peak. Turnover and return volatility in these stocks also largely dried up in the process. The collapse of internet stock prices coincided with a dramatic expansion in the internet companies’ publicly trade",

    "title": "Asset Growth and the Cross-Section",
    "abstract": "We test for firm-level asset investment effects in returns by examining the cross- sectional relation between firm asset growth and subsequent stock returns. Asset growth rates are strong predictors of future abnormal returns. Asset growth retains its forecasting ability even on large capitalization stocks. When we compare asset growth rates with the previously documented determinants of the cross-section of returns (i.e., book-to-market ratios, firm capitalization, lagged returns, accruals, and other growth measures), we find that a firm’s annual asset growth rate emerges as an economically and statistically significant predictor of the cross-section of U.S. Stock returns. ONE OF THE Primary Functions OF Capital Markets is the efficient pricing of real investment. As companies acquire and dispose of assets, economic effi- ciency demands that the market appropriately capitalizes such transactions. Yet, growing evidence identifies an important bias in the market’s capitaliza- tion of corporate asset investment and disinvestment. The findings suggest that corporate events associated with asset expansion (i.e., acquisitions, pub- lic equity offerings, public debt offerings, and bank loan initiations) tend to be followed by periods of abnormally low returns, whereas events associated with asset contraction (i.e., spinoffs, share repurchases, debt prepayments, and divi- dend initiations) tend to be followed by periods of abnormally high returns. 1 In Daniel, Naveen Daniel, David D",

    "abstract": "Using error-free data on life-cycle portfolio allocations of a large sample of Norwegian households, we document a double adjustment as households age: a rebalancing of the portfolio composition away from stocks as they approach retirement and stock market exit after retirement. When structurally estimating an extended life-cycle model, the parameter combination that best ﬁts the data is one with a relatively large risk aversion, a small per-period participation cost, and a yearly probability of a large stock market loss in line with the frequency of stock market crashes in Norway. This Paper Reexamines EMPIRICALLYthe life-cycle behavior of investors’ portfo- lios, establishing novel features of the joint proﬁles of investors’ participation in the stock market and the portfolio share invested in stocks. We estimate the parameters of a standard life-cycle portfolio model with uninsurable labor income, extended to incorporate costly participation and a small probability of a stock market crash, and show that it can capture these features. Inspired by empirical ﬁndings from novel microeconomic data on households’ portfolios, several recent studies provide new contributions to the literature on life-cycle portfolio choice of individual investors building on the seminal contri- butions of Mossin (1968), Samuelson (1969), and Merton (1969, 1971).

    "title": "Asset Pricing Implications of Nonconvex",
    "abstract": "This paper derives a real options model that accounts for the value premium. If real investment is largely irreversible, the book value of assets of a distressed firm is high relative to its market value because it has idle physical capital. The firm’s excess installed capital capacity enables it to fully benefit from positive aggregate shocks without undertaking costly investment. Thus, returns to equity holders of a high book-to-market firm are sensitive to aggregate conditions and its systematic risk is high. Simulations indicate that the model goes a long way toward accounting for the observed value premium. Recent Empirical Studies Have Found Both That (1) stocks of firms that are characterized by a high book-to-market ratio earn on average higher returns than those of firms characterized by a low book-to-market ratio, and (2) cross- sectional stock returns bear little or no discernible relationship to the capital asset pricing model (capm) beta. 1 There is an ongoing debate among finance researchers as to whether the book-to-market ratio proxies for nondiversifiable factor risk or whether security mispricing drives the value premium. This paper develops a real options model that accounts for the observed value premium. The model ties the firm’s book-to-market characteristic to its load- ings with respect to risk factors.

Two features of this market—no systematic risk and terminal values exogenous to betting activity—evade the joint hypothesis problem, allowing mispricing to be detected. Examining a large and diverse set of liquid betting con- tracts, I ﬁnd strong evidence of momentum, consistent with delayed overreaction and inconsistent with underreaction and rational pricing. Returns are a fraction of those in ﬁnancial markets and fail to overcome transactions costs, preventing arbitrage from eliminating them. An insight from betting also predicts value and momentum returns in U.S. Equities. THE Asset Pricing Literature IS replete with predictors of ﬁnancial mar- ket security returns, with much debate on their interpretation. Risk-based theories of rational asset pricing, behavioral theories of mispricing, and statis- tical explanations such as overﬁtting due to data mining provide three distinct views of these ﬁndings, with different implications for the broader role of asset pricing in the economy. Security characteristics that describe expected returns have become the focal point for discussions of market efﬁciency, risk sharing, resource allocation, and investment decisions, with debate centering on whether these variables represent compensation for bearing risk in an informationally efﬁcient market, predictable mispricing in an informationally inefﬁcient market (due perhaps to investor biases and market frictions), or a suggestions and comments of Angie Andrikogi",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a new test of conditional versions of the Sharpe-Lintner Capm, the Jagannathan and Wang (1996) extension of the Capm, and the Fama and French (1993) three-factor model. The test is based on a general non- parametric methodology that avoids functional form misspecification of be- tas, risk premia, and the stochastic discount factor. Our results provide a novel view of empirical performance of these models. In particular, we find that a nonparametric version of the Fama and French model performs well, even when challenged by momentum portfolios. Asset Pricing Models have been the cornerstone in finance. In particular, the Ca- pital Asset Pricing Model (capm) of Sharpe (1964) and Lintner (1965) and its multifactor extensions are the most widely used tools in empirical studies. The Capm has been carefully examined by numerous authors. Recently, a number of anomalies against the unconditional version of the Capm have been identified. The evidence against this constant beta model is so forceful that some argue that the Capm is dead (see Fama and French (1992, 1996b)). However, as Dybvig and Ross (1985) and Hansen and Richard (1987) show theoretically, the conditional version of the Capm can hold perfectly even when the unconditional Capm ex- hibits serious pricing errors. In general, dynamic models that allow for time- varying betas and risk premia can perform substantially better than static mod- els. On the other hand, researchers have uncovered evidence of ti",

    "title": "Asset Pricing with Countercyclical Household",
    "abstract": "We show that shocks to household consumption growth are negatively skewed, per- sistent, countercyclical, and drive asset prices. We construct a parsimonious model where heterogeneous households have recursive preferences. A single state variable drives the conditional cross-sectional moments of household consumption growth. The estimated model ﬁts well the unconditional cross-sectional moments of household consumption growth and the moments of the risk-free rate, equity premium, price- dividend ratio, and aggregate dividend and consumption growth. The model-implied risk-free rate and price-dividend ratio are procyclical, while the market return has countercyclical mean and variance. Finally, household consumption risk explains the cross section of excess returns.

The time variation in idiosyncratic labor income risk plays a central role in understanding several observed phenomena in macroeconomics and ﬁnance. Earlier studies focus on the cross-sectional variance of idiosyncratic shocks, arguing that they are coun- tercyclical (e.g., Storesletten, Telmer, and Yaron (2004)) and can, in principle, account for the high historically observed level of the equity premium (e.g., Con- stantinides and Dufﬁe (1996)).

    "title": "Asset Pricing with Dynamic Margin Constraints",
    "abstract": "This paper provides a novel theoretical analysis of how endogenous time-varying mar- gin requirements affect capital market equilibrium. I ﬁnd that margin requirements, when there are no other market frictions, reduce the volatility and correlation of returns as well as the risk-free rate, but increase the market price of risk, the risk premium, and the price of risky assets. Furthermore, margin requirements generate a strong cross-sectional dispersion of stock return volatilities. The results emphasize that a general equilibrium analysis may reverse the conclusions of a partial equilib- rium analysis often employed in the literature. Margin Debt IS Widely USEDin the ﬁnancial industry to build leveraged posi- tions. To protect themselves against losses caused by adverse price movements, creditors impose margin requirements, which put an upper limit on borrow- ers’ portfolio leverage. The tightness of margin constraints may be regulated legislatively or determined by an agreement between the borrower and the lender. For instance, Regulation T of the Federal Reserve sets initial margin requirements on equity investments, that is, it restricts the loan amount that investors can receive from brokers for purchasing stocks. Since January 1974, the initial margin requirement has been 50%. In addition, brokerage ﬁrms usually impose further restrictions on how leveraged their customers can be by setting a minimum amount of equity that borrowers must maintain. The tightness of margin r",

    "title": "Asset Pricing with Garbage",
    "abstract": "A new measure of consumption, garbage, is more volatile and more correlated with stocks than the canonical measure, National Income and Product Accounts (nipa) consumption expenditure. A garbage-based consumption capital asset pricing model matches the U.S. Equity premium with relative risk aversion of 17 versus 81 and evades the joint equity premium-risk-free rate puzzle. These results carry through to European data. In a cross-section of size, value, and industry portfolios, garbage growth is priced and drives out Nipa expenditure growth. THE Textbook STATEMENTof the equity premium puzzle is that under standard assumptions, given the observed low volatility of consumption, the average ex- cess return of stocks over bonds is too high (Mehra and Prescott (1985)). The textbook response is to introduce new preferences (e.g., Epstein and Zin (1991) and Constantinides (1990)), posit incomplete markets (e.g., Constantinides and Dufﬁe (1996)), or conjure rare disasters (e.g., Rietz (1988)). Similarly, the long- run risk literature (e.g., Bansal and Yaron (2004)) relies on both nonstan- dard preferences and hard-to-detect low-frequency consumption volatility. But a simple restatement of the puzzle hints at a more parsimonious solution: un- der standard assumptions, given the observed high equity premium, measured consumption is too smooth. A new and distinct measure of consumption could shed light on the puzzle by addressing the key question: is the problem with the model or with th",

    "title": "Asset Pricing without Garbage",
    "abstract": "This paper provides an explanation for why garbage implies a much lower relative risk aversion in the consumption-based asset pricing model than National Income and Product Accounts (nipa) consumption expenditure: Unlike garbage, Nipa con- sumption is ﬁltered to mitigate measurement error. I apply a simple model of the ﬁltering process that allows one to undo the ﬁltering inherent in Nipa consumption. “Unﬁltered Nipa consumption” well explains the equity premium and is priced in the cross-section of stock returns. I discuss the likely properties of true consumption (i.e., without measurement error and ﬁltering) and quantify implications for habit and long-run risk models. IN Response TO THE Failure of the classic consumption-based capital asset pricing model to explain the equity premium, the risk-free rate, and return predictability, recent literature has largely focused on developing alternative models of investor behavior. However, the deﬁciencies of the classic model might be attributed, at least in part, to a failure to measure consumption correctly. In a seminal contribution, Savov (2011) ﬁnds that using garbage to capture consumption, the classic model matches the equity premium and risk-free rate with a coefﬁcient of relative risk aversion that is several times lower compared to using any other consumption measure based on National Income and Product Accounts (nipa). A possible explanation for the relative success of garbage is that Nipa consumption fails to measure c",

    "title": "Asset Quality Misrepresentation by Financial",
    "abstract": "We document that contractual disclosures by intermediaries during the sale of mort- gages contained false information about the borrower’s housing equity in 7–14% of loans. The rate of misrepresented loan default was 70% higher than for similar loans. These misrepresentations likely occurred late in the intermediation and ex- ist among securities sold by all reputable intermediaries. Investors—including large institutions—holding securities with misrepresented collateral suffered severe losses due to loan defaults, price declines, and ratings downgrades. Pools with misrepresen- tations were not issued at a discount. Misrepresentation on another easy-to-quantify dimension shows that these effects are a conservative lower bound. Market Rules AND Regulations that require disclosure of information and pro- hibit misleading statements on the ﬁnancial products being manufactured by intermediaries play an important role in the functioning of capital markets (Akerlof ( 1970)). However, the nature of intermediation has changed dramati- cally over the past decade, with the introduction of more agents in the supply chain of credit (Loutskina and Strahan ( 2009), Keys et al. ( 2013), Nadauld and Sherlund ( 2013)) potentially weakening the ability of existing market ar- rangements and regulatory oversight to ensure truthful disclosure of asset quality.

    "title": "Asset Sales, Investment Opportunities,",
    "abstract": "This study examines the allocation of cash proceeds following 400 subsidiary sales between 1990 and 1998. Retention probabilities are increasing in the divesting firm’s contemporaneous growth opportunities and expected investment. Retaining firms, however, also systematically overinvest relative to an industry benchmark. Share- holder returns to retention decisions are positively correlated with growth oppor- tunities and benchmarked investment, but negatively correlated with benchmarked investment for firms with poor growth opportunities. Shareholder returns to debt dis- tributions are increasing in industry-benchmarked leverage. Overall, the results of this study cohere with the hypothesized trade-off between the investment efficiencies associated with retained proceeds and the agency costs of managerial discretion and debt. Sales OF Large Corporate Subsidiaries became an increasingly common form of business restructuring by U.S. Corporations through the decade of the 1990s. The Securities Data Corporation (SDC) reports that the number of large sub- sidiary sales, valued at $75 million or more, increased steadily from 127 trans- actions completed in 1990, to 535 transactions completed in 1998. Unlike other divestiture methods, such as asset spinoffs and carveouts involving the distribu- tion of proceeds to a subsidiary, a divesting firm typically receives remuneration at the effective date of a sale. Often this compensation includes a substantial cash component. For example",

    "title": "Asset Trading Volume with Dynamically Complete Markets and Heterogeneous Agents",
    "abstract": "Trading volume of infinitely lived securities, such as equity, is generically zero in Lucas asset pricing models with heterogeneous agents. More generally, the end- of-period portfolio of all securities is constant over time and states in the generic economy. General equilibrium restrictions rule out trading of equity after an in- itial period. This result contrasts the prediction of portfolio allocation analyses that portfolio rebalancing motives produce nontrivial trade volume. Therefore, other causes of trade must be present in asset markets with large trading volume. Each DAY Finds Investors actively trading assets. However, the Lucas (1978) asset pricing model, the foundation of much of general equilibrium finance theory, says little about volume since it assumes a representative agent (or, equivalently, sev- eral identical investors) and has no trade in equilibrium. If markets are complete or can be completed through dynamic trading of the available securities (as in Kreps (1982)), then asset prices evolve as if there is a single agent even when there are several agents with different tastes and income processes. Therefore, repre- sentative agent models are generally valuable for a theory of asset pricing with complete markets. This approach says nothing about trading volume, which is operation of asset markets and the underlying tastes of investors.

    "title": "Asymmetric Information about Collateral Values",
    "abstract": "I empirically analyze credit market outcomes when competing lenders are differen- tially informed about the expected return from making a loan. I study the residential mortgage market, where property developers often cooperate with vertically inte- grated mortgage lenders to offer ﬁnancing to buyers of new homes. I show that these integrated lenders have superior information about the construction quality of indi- vidual homes and exploit this information to lend against higher quality collateral, decreasing foreclosures by up to 40%. To compensate for this adverse selection on col- lateral quality, nonintegrated lenders charge higher interest rates when competing against a better-informed integrated lender. What is the impact on equilibrium credit market outcomes when competing lenders are differentially informed about the expected return from making a loan? I analyze this question by studying lender competition in the residential mortgage market. Empirical studies of the impact of asymmetric information in credit markets usually face the challenge of identifying the relative infor- mation of the different parties (Petersen and Rajan (1994), Ausubel (1999), Karlan and Zinman (2009)). I address this challenge by focusing on the compe- tition between lenders to originate mortgages used to purchase newly developed properties. In this market, property developers regularly provide home buyers with ﬁnancing offers through vertically integrated mortgage lenders (Agarwal et al. (201",

    "title": "Asymmetric Learning from Financial",
    "abstract": "This study asks whether investors learn differently from gains versus losses. I ﬁnd experimental evidence that indicates that being in the negative domain leads indi- viduals to form overly pessimistic beliefs about available investment options. This pessimism bias is driven by people reacting more to low outcomes in the negative domain relative to the positive domain. Such asymmetric learning may help explain documented empirical patterns regarding the differential role of poor versus good economic conditions on investment behavior and household economic choices. DO Investors Learn THEsame way when they face positive outcomes as when they face negative outcomes? Do economic agents form beliefs using the same learning rules during recessions as during booms? Converging ﬁndings from ﬁnance and neuroscience suggest that this may not be the case. Recent empirical ﬁnance work indicates that learning by market partici- pants may differ depending on whether the economic conditions are good or bad. Economic downturns are characterized by stronger reactions to negative news by equity markets, higher risk premia, and more pessimistic expectations by corporate executives (Andersen et al. (2007), Bollerslev and Todorov (2011), Ben-David, Graham, and Harvey (2013)). Poor stock market outcomes receive disproportionately pessimistic press coverage (Garcia (2012)).

    "title": "Asymmetric Price Movements and Borrowing",
    "abstract": "This study proposes a rational expectations equilibrium model of crises and contagion in an economy with information asymmetry and borrowing constraints. Consistent with empirical observations, the model finds: (1) Crises can be caused by small shocks to fundamentals; (2) market return distributions are asymmetric; and (3) correla- tions among asset returns tend to increase during crashes. The model also predicts: (1) Crises and contagion are likely to occur after small shocks in the intermediate price region; (2) the skewness of asset price distributions increases with information asymmetry and borrowing constraints; and (3) crises can spread through investor borrowing constraints. IN THE Last TWO Decades, asset markets have shown numerous large price move- ments. This phenomenon can be seen both historically and globally: the U.S. Stock market crash of 1987, the burst of Japan’s stock market bubble in 1989, the European exchange-rate debacle in 1992 to 1993, the Mexican crisis of 1995, the Asian crisis of 1997 to 1998, the default of the Russian government in 1998, the sharp depreciation of the real in Brazil in 1999, and more recently, the default of the Argentinian government and the collapse of its currency board regime in 2001.

    "abstract": "Exploiting a screen display feature whereby the order of stock display is determined by the stock’s listing code, we lever a novel identiﬁcation strategy and study how the interaction between overconﬁdence and limited attention affect asset pricing. We ﬁnd that stocks displayed next to those with higher returns in the past two weeks are associated with higher returns in the future week, which are reverted in the long run. This is consistent with our conjectures that investors tend to trade more after positive investment experience and are more likely to pay attention to neighboring stocks, both conﬁrmed using trading data. Overconfidence AND Limited Attention ARE TWO widely documented features of investor behavior, and asset pricing theories have used both biases extensively to explain a wide range of market phenomena (see Daniel and Hir- shleifer ( 2015), Barber, Lin, and Odean ( 2019), and Gabaix ( 2019) for reviews of the literature). Previous studies that investigate the pricing implications of these two behavioral biases typically focus on one at a time, abstracting from potential interactions among them. This is likely due to the empirical challenge in establishing a causal effect. Indeed, overconﬁdence and limited attention are difﬁcult to identify even when considered alone — variables that boost investor overconﬁdence (e.g., past experienced returns) or that attract or reﬂect investor attention (e.g., news headlines, extreme past returns, trad- ing volume) are typica",

    "abstract": "We study the inﬂuence of ﬁnancial innovation by ﬁntech brokerages on individual investors’ trading and stock prices. Using data from Robinhood, we ﬁnd that Robin- hood investors engage in more attention-induced trading than other retail investors. For example, Robinhood outages disproportionately reduce trading in high-attention stocks. While this evidence is consistent with Robinhood attracting relatively inexpe- rienced investors, we show that it is also driven in part by the app’s unique features. Consistent with models of attention-induced trading, intense buying by Robinhood users forecasts negative returns. Average 20-day abnormal returns are−4.7% for the top stocks purchased each day. Over THE Past Half -century , Investor trading has changed signiﬁcantly. Decades ago, retail investors traded via phone only during market hours, paying heavy commissions to do so. The 1990s brought about online trad- ing and signiﬁcantly lower commissions.

    "title": "Attracting Attention: Cheap Managerial Talk",
    "abstract": "We provide a theory of informal communication—cheap talk—between firms and cap- ital markets that incorporates the role of agency conflicts between managers and shareholders. The analysis suggests that a policy of discretionary disclosure that en- courages managers to attract the market’s attention when the firm is substantially undervalued can create shareholder value. The theory also relates the credibility of managerial announcements to the use of stock-based compensation, the presence of informed trading, and the liquidity of the stock. Our results are consistent with the ex- istence of positive announcement effects produced by apparently innocuous corporate events (e.g., stock dividends, name changes). Recent Regulations such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act stress the importance of providing timely and accurate information to investors. In practice, firm in- formation can be concealed and is often difficult to substantiate. Moreover, there is likely to be fundamental disagreement between managers and share- holders with respect to the firm’s disclosure policy. Managers can be reluctant to disclose information because, for example, it may reflect prior poor man- agerial decisions and hence question their performance. Inducing managers to disclose information is therefore an essential component of managerial in- centives. As a result, a firm’s disclosure and compensation policies are intrin- sically related aspects of corporate governance that cannot be considered in isolation.",

    "abstract": "This paper uses a randomized ﬁeld experiment to identify which start-up characteris- tics are most important to investors in early-stage ﬁrms. The experiment randomizes investors’ information sets of fund-raising start-ups. The average investor responds strongly to information about the founding team, but not to ﬁrm traction or existing lead investors. We provide evidence that the team is not merely a signal of quality, and that investing based on team information is a rational strategy. Together, our results indicate that information about human assets is causally important for the funding of early-stage ﬁrms and hence for entrepreneurial success. Early-stage Investors Provide ﬁnancial capital to young entrepreneurial ﬁrms, enabling their birth and development and thus contributing to innova- tion and growth in the economy (Solow (1957)). Start-up ﬁrms are particularly difﬁcult to ﬁnance because their prospects are highly uncertain, they lack tan- gible assets that can be used as collateral, and they face severe information problems (Hall and Lerner (2010)). Given these problems, how do investors choose which start-ups to fund, that is, what factors drive their selection pro- cess? While this question is often debated among academics and practitioners (e.g., Quindlen (2000), Gompers and Lerner (2001)), systematic evidence on the selection process of early-stage investors is scarce.

    "title": "Attracting Flows by Attracting Big Clients",
    "abstract": "We explore a new channel for attracting inflows using a unique data set of corporate 401(k) retirement plans and their mutual fund family trustees. Families secure sub- stantial inflows by being named trustee. We find that family trustees significantly overweight, and are reluctant to sell, their 401(k) client firm’s stock. Trustee over- weighting is more pronounced when the relationship is more valuable to the trustee family, and is concentrated in those funds receiving the greatest benefit from the in- flows. We quantify this flow benefit and find that inclusion in the 401(k) plan has an economically and statistically large, positive effect on inflows. Retirement Assets Make UP a large and growing percentage of the mutual fund universe. In 2004, nearly 40% of all mutual fund assets were held by Defined Contribution Plans and Individual Retirement Accounts. This percentage is steadily increasing largely because these retirement accounts represent the majority of new flows into nonmoney market mutual funds (60% in 2004). 1 With such a large and growing percentage of their assets coming from retirement accounts, mutual funds are likely to be interested in securing these big clients. Previous literature on the agency problems associated with increasing funds under management has concentrated on the flow–performance relationship (Brown, Harlow, and Starks (1996), Goetzmann and Peles (1997), and Sirri and Tufano (1998)).

    "abstract": "We investigate a seller’s strategic choice between optimally structured negotiations with fewer bidders and an auction with more competing bidders when payments can have a contingent component, as is common in mergers and acquisitions (M&A), patent licensing, and employee compensation. The key factor favoring negotiations is that it allows the seller to set her preferred payment structure—that is, the revenue-maximizing mix of cash and contingent pay; reserve prices are of secondary importance. Negotiations are more likely to dominate if synergies increase in bid- ders’ productivity types (as with acquirer-target complementarities in M&A). Higher dispersion and magnitude of bidders’ private valuations also favor negotiations. A Fundamental Question IN Financial economics concerns how a seller can maximize revenue when buyers are privately informed about their valua- tions. In many applications, such revenue maximization involves the strategic choice of whether to spend limited resources—like funds, time, and effort— on optimal negotiations with a small group of interested bidders or whether to increase competition by attracting additional bidders who then compete in a standard auction mechanism. A seminal result in the theory of optimal cash auctions is that increasing competition generates higher expected rev- enue than even the most elaborate negotiation tactics (Bulow and Klemperer (1996)).

    "title": "Auctions with Endogenous Initiation",
    "abstract": "We study initiation of takeover auctions by potential buyers and the seller. A bidder’s indication of interest reveals that she is optimistic about the target. If bidders’ val- ues have a substantial common component, as in takeover battles between ﬁnancial bidders, this effect disincentivizes bidders from indicating interest, and auctions are seller-initiated. Conversely, in private-value auctions, such as battles between strate- gic bidders, equilibria can feature both seller- and bidder-initiated auctions, with the likelihood of the latter decreasing in commonality of values and the probability of a forced sale by the seller. We also relate initiation to bids and auction outcomes. Over THE Last Several Decades , auction theory has developed into a highly inﬂuential ﬁeld with many important practical results, including those related to applications in ﬁnance. 1 To focus on the insights about the auction stage, with rare exceptions, the literature has examined situations in which the asset is already up for sale. In some cases, exogeneity of a sale is an in- nocuous assumption. For example, the U.S. Treasury auctions off bonds at a known frequency. In many cases, however, the decision to put an asset up for an auction is a strategic one. For example, a ﬁrm’s board of directors has the right but not an obligation to sell a division. In practice, an auction can be either bidder-initiated, whereby a potential bidder approaches the seller ex- pressing an interest, in which case",

    "abstract": "This paper characterizes U.S. Consumption dynamics from the perspective of a Bayesian agent facing realistic high-dimensional macroeconomic learning prob- lems using standard Markov switching models. Joint parameter, model, and state learning generates substantially diﬀerent subjective beliefs about consump- tion dynamics compared to the standard, full-information rational expectations benchmark with parameters ﬁxed at full-sample values. Beliefs about long-run dynamics drift over time, are volatile, are countercyclical, and, when embed- ded in a standard consumption-based asset pricing model, signiﬁcantly improve the model’s performance in terms of its ability to match standard asset price moments and the sample path of the market price-dividend ratio.

A simple model can therefore explain book-to-market and size anomalies, as well as the negative relation between idiosyncratic volatility and stock returns. Empirically, we ﬁnd that anomalies are more pronounced for ﬁrms with high idiosyncratic cash ﬂow volatility. More generally, our results imply that any economic variable correlated with the history of idiosyncratic shocks can help explain expected stock returns. It is well established that, under standard asset pricing assumptions, only systematic risk is priced. In this paper, we argue that unpriced idiosyncratic cash ﬂow shocks can also be important for asset prices as they contain valuable conditioning information in a dynamic asset pricing framework. In particular, we show that the conditional beta with respect to any priced source of risk depends directly on the history of ﬁrm-speciﬁc shocks. We use this insight to provide risk-based explanations for several anomalies in the cross-section of equity returns, including the widely documented value and size eﬀects, the negative relation between idiosyncratic volatility and stock returns, and the underperformance following investment and equity issuance.

In our setting, directors aﬀect their ﬁrms’ governance, and governance in turn aﬀects ﬁrms’ demand for new directors. Whether the labor mar- ket rewards a shareholder-friendly or management-friendly reputation is determined in equilibrium and depends on aggregate governance. We show that directors’ desire to be invited to other boards creates strategic complementarity of corporate governance across ﬁrms. Directors’ reputational concerns amplify the governance system: strong systems become stronger and weak systems become weaker.

    "abstract": "A global trend towards automated trading systems raises the important question of whether execution costs are, in fact, lower than on trading floors. This paper compares the trade execution costs of similar stocks in an automated trading struc- ture (Paris Bourse) and a floor-based trading structure (nyse). Results indicate that execution costs are higher in Paris than in New York after controlling for differences in adverse selection, relative tick size, and economic attributes across samples. These results suggest that the present form of the automated trading system may not be able to fully replicate the benefits of human intermediation on a trading floor. A Trading Mechanism IS Defined by the distinctive set of rules that govern the trading process. The rules dictate when and how orders can be submitted, who may see or handle the orders, how orders are processed, and how prices are set (see O'Hara (1995)). The rules of trading affect the profitability of various trading strategies (see Harris (1997)), and hence affect trader be- havior, price formation, and trading costs. A fundamental question in secu- rities market design is the link between the rules of the trading mechanism and the cost of trade execution. Numerous studies have investigated this issue by comparing bid-ask spreads in the auction-based New York Stock Exchange (nyse) and the dealer-based Nasdaq.' While much of the debate centers on the relative merits of auction and dealer markets, an alternative greatly",

    "title": "Automation versus Intermediation: Evidence",
    "abstract": "This paper examines the choice of trading venue by dealers in U.S. Treasury securities to determine when services provided by human intermediaries are difficult to replicate in fully automated trading systems. When Treasury securities go “off the run” their trading volume drops by more than 90%. This decline in trading volume allows us to test whether intermediaries’ knowledge of the market and its participants can uncover hidden liquidity and facilitate better matching of customer orders in less active markets. Consistent with this hypothesis, the market share of electronic intermediaries falls from 81% to 12% when securities go off the run. Electronic Trading Systems Have Been steadily increasing their share of securities trading in almost all financial markets. As the amount of automa- tion in financial markets increases, it is natural to ask what services human intermediaries provide that are difficult or impossible to replicate in a fully automated trading system. Existing theory suggests that human intermedi- aries play at least two important functions. First, an intermediary’s knowl- edge of the market and its participants may uncover hidden liquidity that facilitates quicker and more efficient matching of customer orders (Grossman (1992)). The value of this matching function is greater when trading volume is low and matches are difficult to find. Second, when information asymmetry is high, the repeated interaction between an intermediary and its customers al- lows the",

    "abstract": "The book-to-market ratio (B/M) is a noisy measure of expected stock returns because it also varies with expected cashflows. Our hypothesis is that the evolution of B/M, in terms of past changes in book equity and price, contains independent information about expected cashflows that can be used to improve estimates of expected returns. The tests support this hypothesis, with results that are largely but not entirely similar for Microcap stocks (below the 20 th Nyse market capitalization percentile) and All but Micro stocks (ABM). Firms With Higher Ratios OF THE Book Value of common stock to its market value have higher average stock returns (Rosenberg, Reid, and Lanstein (1985), Fama and French (1992), Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny (1994)). The book- to-market ratio (B/M) is, however, a noisy measure of expected returns because it also varies with expected cashflows (dividends). Vuolteenaho (2002) finds that differences in forecasts of cashflows loom large in the cross section of B/M for individual stocks. To absorb dispersion in the cross section of B/M due to expected cashflows, Fama and French (2006) develop estimates of expected cashflows that combine a wide range of accounting fundamentals and other variables. They use the estimates of expected cashflows, along with B/M, to explain the cross section of average returns, with limited success. (They cite a large literature that uses variants of this approach.) We take a different approach here. Specifically, we examine wh",

In the three years following a $0.88 minimum wage increase, low-wage workers experience a $2,712 income increase and a $856 decrease in debt. The entire decline in debt comes buffer-stock behavior, and other rational channels cannot explain the reduction in student debt. Our results are consistent with students perceiving a utility cost of borrowing student debt arising from mental accounting. HOW DO Wage Gains Affect the borrowing and debt decisions of low-wage workers?

    "abstract": "We find that the majority of variation in leverage ratios is driven by an unobserved time-invariant effect that generates surprisingly stable capital structures: High (low) levered firms tend to remain as such for over two decades. This feature of leverage is largely unexplained by previously identified determinants, is robust to firm exit, and is present prior to the IPO, suggesting that variation in capital structures is primarily determined by factors that remain stable for long periods of time. We then show that these results have important implications for empirical analysis attempting to understand capital structure heterogeneity. A Fundamental Question IN Financial Economics IS: How do firms choose their cap- ital structures? Indeed, this question is at the heart of the “capital structure puzzle” put forward by Myers (1984) in his AFA presidential address. Attempts to answer this question have generated a great deal of discussion in the finance literature. Many studies, both before and after Myers’s pronouncement, iden- tify a number of factors that purport to explain variation in corporate capital More precisely, how much closer have previously identified determinants and existing empirical models moved us toward solving the capital structure puzzle? And, given this progress, how can we move still closer to ultimately providing a more complete understanding of capital structure decisions? The goal of this paper is to address these questions.

    "abstract": "We study the ﬁnancial and labor market impacts of bad credit reports. Using difference-in-differences variation from the staggered removal of bankruptcy ﬂags, we show that bankruptcy ﬂag removal leads to economically large increases in credit limits and borrowing. Using administrative tax records linked to personal bankruptcy records, we estimate economically small effects of ﬂag removal on employment and earnings outcomes. We rationalize these contrasting results by showing that, condi- tional on basic observables, “hidden” bankruptcy ﬂags are strongly correlated with adverse credit market outcomes but have no predictive power for measures of job performance. THE Increasing Availability AND Richness of credit report data is one of the most signiﬁcant changes in consumer ﬁnancial markets over the last 25 years. In the United States, credit reports—and the associated credit scores— are used in nearly all consumer lending decisions, including both approval and pricing decisions for credit cards, private student loans, auto loans, and home mortgages.

    "abstract": "Various theories have been proposed to explain momentum in stock returns. We test the gradual-information-diffusion model of Hong and Stein (1999) and estab- lish three key results. First, once one moves past the very smallest stocks, the profitability of momentum strategies declines sharply with firm size. Second, hold- ing size fixed, momentum strategies work better among stocks with low analyst coverage. Finally, the effect of analyst coverage is greater for stocks that are past losers than for past winners. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that firm-specific information, especially negative information, diffuses only grad- ually across the investing public. Several Recent Papers Have Documented that, at medium-term horizons rang- ing from three to 12 months, stock returns exhibit momentum-that is, past winners continue to perform well, and past losers continue to perform poorly. For example, Jegadeesh and Titman (1993), using a U.S. Sample of Nyse/ Amex stocks over the period from 1965 to 1989, find that a strategy that buys past six-month winners (stocks in the top performance decile) and shorts past six-month losers (stocks in the bottom performance decile) earns ap- proximately one percent per month over the subsequent six months. Not only is this an economically interesting magnitude, but the result also ap- pears to be robust: Rouwenhorst (1998) obtains very similar numbers in a sample of 12 European countries over the period from 1980 to 1995.1 Geer",

    "abstract": "We develop a model of bailout stigma in which accepting a bailout signals a ﬁrm’s balance-sheet weakness and reduces its funding prospects. To avoid stigma, high- quality ﬁrms withdraw from subsequent ﬁnancing after receiving bailouts or refuse bailouts altogether to send a favorable signal. The former leads to a short-lived stim- ulation followed by a market freeze even worse than if there were no bailout. The latter revives the funding market, albeit with delay , to the level achievable with- out any stigma and implements a constrained optimal outcome. A menu of multiple bailout programs compounds bailout stigma and exacerbates the market freeze. History IS Fraught With Financial crises and large-scale government interventions, the latter often involving a highly visible and signiﬁcant wealth transfer from taxpayers to banks and their creditors. As a recent example, during the 2007 to 2009 Great Recession, the U.S. Government paid $125 bil- lion for assets worth $86 billion to $109 billion to the nine largest banks under A rationale for such public interventions—to be called bailouts throughout the paper—is that the government can jump-start a market that would oth- erwise freeze due to adverse selection. By cleaning up bad assets, or “dregs skimming,” through public bailouts, the government can improve market con- ﬁdence and galvanize transactions in healthier assets (Philippon and Skreta (2012), Tirole (2012)).

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the mechanisms behind the matching of banks and ﬁrms in the loan market and the implications of this matching for lending relationships, bank capital, and credit provision. I ﬁnd that bank-dependent ﬁrms borrow from well- capitalized banks, while ﬁrms with access to the bond market borrow from banks with less capital. This matching of bank-dependent ﬁrms with stable banks smooths cyclicality in aggregate credit provision and mitigates the effects of bank shocks on the real economy. Banking Relationships ARE AN Important SOURCEof external ﬁnance for many ﬁrms. An extensive literature highlights the effects of banking relationships on ﬁrms’ cost of capital and nonﬁnancial outcomes.1 An important segment of this literature shows that informational frictions make it costly for ﬁrms to switch lenders, leading to a “credit channel” that transmits shocks from banks to their borrowers.2 While the effects of banking relationships are well understood, little evidence exists on the determinants of these relationships. What drives a ﬁrm to borrow from one bank instead of another? Do banks specialize in lending to certain types of borrowers? And if endogenous matching occurs in the loan market, what are the consequences for credit provision? I address these questions in this paper.

    "abstract": "Corporate credit lines are drawn more heavily when funding markets are stressed. This elevates expected bank funding costs. We show that credit supply is dampened by the associated debt-overhang cost to bank shareholders. Until 2022, this impact was reduced by linking the interest paid on lines to a credit-sensitive reference rate like the London interbank offered rate (libor). We show that transition to risk-free reference rates may exacerbate this friction. The adverse impact on credit supply is offset if drawdowns are expected to be deposited at the same bank, which happened at some of the largest banks during the global ﬁnancial crisis and Covid recession. IN THE United States , most bank lending to corporations takes the form of revolving credit lines that give borrowers the option to draw any amount of credit, up to an agreed limit, at any time before maturity at agreed pricing terms.

    "abstract": "We present evidence of a risk-taking channel of monetary policy for the U.S. Banking system. We use conﬁdential data on banks’ internal ratings on loans to businesses over the period 1997 to 2011 from the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Terms of Business Lending. We ﬁnd that ex ante risk-taking by banks (measured by the risk rating of new loans) is negatively associated with increases in short-term interest rates. This relationship is more pronounced in regions that are less in sync with the nationwide business cycle, and less pronounced for banks with relatively low capital or during periods of ﬁnancial distress. THE Global Financial Crisis has reignited the debate on the link between short- term interest rates and bank risk-taking, also known as monetary policy’s “risk- taking” channel—the notion that interest rate policy affects the quality, not just the quantity, of bank credit.1 Speciﬁcally, many hold the view that interest rates Ken Singleton (the Editor), an anonymous Associate Editor, an anonymous referee, Tobias Adrian, William Bassett, Olivier Blanchard, Francisco Covas, Hans Degryse, Burcu Duygan-Bump, Mark Gertler, Robin Greenwood, Kose John, Anil Kashyap, Aart Kraay, Nellie Liang, David Lucca, Maria Soledad Martinez Peria, Robert Marquez, Steven Ongena, Ali Ozdagli, Teodora Paligorova, Jose Luis Peydro, Ricardo Reis, Kasper Roszbach, Joao Santos, David Scharfstein, Philipp Schnabl, Steve Sharpe, Hyun Shin, Andrei Shleifer, Jeremy Stein, Ren ´e Stulz, Lars Svensson, F",

    "abstract": "This paper explores the relevance of capital market supply frictions for corporate capital structure decisions. To identify this relationship, I study the effect on firms’ fi- nancial structures of two changes in bank funding constraints: the 1961 emergence of the market for certificates of deposit, and the 1966 Credit Crunch. Following an expan- sion (contraction) in the availability of bank loans, leverage ratios of bank-dependent firms significantly increase (decrease) relative to firms with bond market access. Con- current changes in the composition of financing sources lend further support to the role of credit supply and debt market segmentation in capital structure choice. ARE Capital Market Supply FRICTIONSrelevant for corporate capital structure deci- sions? If the supply of different forms of capital is infinitely elastic, as assumed by Modigliani and Miller (1958), then debt levels are determined solely by a firm’s demand for debt. However, several recent pieces of evidence suggest this may not be the case. First, anecdotal (Titman (2002)) and survey (Graham and Harvey (2001)) evidence suggest that practitioners view supply conditions as important inputs to the capital structure decision. Second, Faulkender and Petersen (2006) present evidence that firms with a bond rating have higher leverage ratios than those without, even after controlling for debt demand.

    "title": "Bank Loans, Bonds, and Information Monopolies",
    "abstract": "Theory suggests that banks’ private information about borrowers lets them hold up borrowers for higher interest rates. Since hold-up power increases with borrower risk, banks with exploitable information should be able to raise their rates in recessions by more than is justified by borrower risk alone. We test this hypothesis by comparing the pricing of loans for bank-dependent borrowers with the pricing of loans for borrowers with access to public debt markets, controlling for risk factors. Loan spreads rise in recessions, but firms with public debt market access pay lower spreads and their spreads rise significantly less in recessions. THE Idea That There ARE Both Costs AND Benefits to relying on bank debt is an integral part of the modern theory of corporate finance. As formulated by Rajan (1992), the pros and cons are as follows. Being relatively concentrated, bank debt has more incentive to monitor the borrower than does dispersed “arm’s length” debt. But then the private information that the bank gains through monitoring allows it to “hold up” the borrower—if the borrower seeks to switch to a new funding source, it is pegged as a lemon regardless of its true financial condition. 1 In this paper, we seek empirical evidence for this informational hold- up effect by contrasting the pricing of bank loans for bank-dependent borrowers Carey, Gabriella Chiesa, Murray Frank, Anne Gron, John Ham, Chris James, Ross Levine, Robert Marquez, Mitchell Petersen, Amiyatosh Purnanandam,",

    "title": "Bank Market Power and Monetary Policy",
    "abstract": "We quantify the impact of bank market power on monetary policy transmission through banks to borrowers. We estimate a dynamic banking model in which mone- tary policy affects imperfectly competitive banks’ funding costs. Banks optimize the pass-through of these costs to borrowers and depositors, while facing capital and re- serve regulation. We ﬁnd that bank market power explains much of the transmission of monetary policy to borrowers, with an effect comparable to that of bank capital reg- ulation. When the federal funds rate falls below 0.9%, market power interacts with bank capital regulation to produce a reversal of the effect of monetary policy. WE Examine THE Quantitative Impact of bank market power on the transmission of monetary policy through the banking system. This transmis- sion channel is potentially important, given three decades of consolidation in the banking industry that has softened competitive pressure. Moreover, described in this paper.

    "title": "Bank Mergers and Crime: The Real and Social",
    "abstract": "Using a unique sample of commercial loans and mergers between large banks, we provide micro-level (within-county) evidence linking credit conditions to economic de- velopment and find a spillover effect on crime. Neighborhoods that experience more bank mergers are subject to higher interest rates, diminished local construction, lower prices, an influx of poorer households, and higher property crime in subsequent years. The elasticity of property crime with respect to merger-induced banking concentration is 0.18. We show that these results are not likely due to reverse causation, and con- firm the central findings using state branching deregulation to instrument for bank competition. WE Examine THE Real AND Social Impact of local credit competition by document- ing a link between the competitiveness of the local banking market, credit conditions, urban development, and crime. Several recent studies (Peek and Rosengren (2000), Cetorelli and Gambera (2001), Klein, Peek, and Rosengren (2002), and Burgess and Pande (2003)) tie credit market imperfections to di- minished real economic activity and growth. Other studies connect the eco- nomic environment to property crime (Freeman (1999), Levitt (2001), Raphael and Winter-Ebmer (2001), and Nilsson (2004)). It is reasonable to hypothesize, therefore, that reductions in bank competition may lead to economic decline and, subsequently, increases in property crime.

    "abstract": "Italian ﬁrms delay payment to banks weakened by past loan losses. Exploiting Credit Register data, we fully absorb borrower fundamentals with ﬁrm-quarter effects. Iden- tiﬁcation therefore reﬂects ﬁrm choices to delay payment to some banks, depending on their health. This selective delay occurs more where legal enforcement of collateral recovery is slow. Poor enforcement encourages borrowers not to pay when the value of their bank relationship comes into doubt. Selective delays occur even by ﬁrms able to pay all lenders. Credit losses in Italy have thus been worsened by the combination of weak banks and weak legal enforcement. THE Long AND Deep Recession after the ﬁnancial and foreign debt crises in Europe has left a legacy of nonperforming loans on Italian banks’ balance sheets. In December 2015, bad loans equaled about 200 billion, approximately 11% of the total amount of loans outstanding (18% if we include other troubled loans not written off). Unlike other recent banking problems, where losses were concentrated in real estate or sovereign debt exposure, close to 80% of these bad debts came from bank lending to nonﬁnancial businesses (Bank of Italy (2016)).1 ﬁnancial support other than their normal salaries from their institutions.

    "title": "Bank and Nonbank Financial Intermediation",
    "abstract": "Conglomerates, trade credit arrangements, and banks are all instances of financial intermediation. However, these institutions differ significantly in the extent to which the projects financed absorb aggregate intermediary risk, in whether or not interme- diation is carried out by a financial specialist, in the type of projects they fund and in the type of claims they issue to investors. The paper develops a simple unified model that both accounts for the continued coexistence of these different forms of intermedi- ation, and explains why they differ. Specific applications to conglomerate firms, trade credit, and banking are discussed. Conglomerates, Trade Credit Arrangements, AND Banks are all instances of finan- cial intermediation. In each case, the conglomerate headquarters/supplier/bank obtains funds by selling financial securities, while in turn providing funds in exchange for a claim on project cash flows. 1 However, in spite of the funda- mental similarity between these forms of financial intermediation, important differences exist between them. In particular: (I) What happens to project financing when the financial intermediary as a whole performs badly? Projects financed by conglomerates are ad- versely affected, in the sense that resources available to each division for investment are curtailed. 2 On the other hand, large bank borrowers are not much affected by a decline in the fortunes of their lending bank.3 (II) Who performs the intermediation function?

    "title": "Banking Deregulation and Industry",
    "abstract": "We investigate how the deregulation of the French banking industry in the 1980s affected the real behavior of firms and the structure and dynamics of product markets. Following deregulation, banks are less willing to bail out poorly performing firms and firms in the more bank-dependent sectors are more likely to undertake restructuring activities. At the industry level, we observe an increase in asset and job reallocation, an improvement in allocative efficiency across firms, and a decline in concentration. Overall, these findings support the view that a more efficient banking sector helps foster a Schumpeterian process of “creative destruction.” Many Economies Around THE World are characterized by heavily regulated bank- ing sectors, whereby the state intervenes directly or indirectly in banks’ lending decisions. These interventions can take a number of forms, such as state owner- ship of banks, regulatory limits on competition, subsidized lending, or directed credits. A large literature documents the prevalence and scope of such state in- terventions across countries (see, for example, La Porta, Lopez de Silanes, and Shleifer (2002), Dinc ¸ (2003), or Demirg¨uc ¸-Kunt, Laeven, and Levine (2004)). A few papers, such as Sapienza (2004), Mian (2003), and Jayaratne and Strahan (1996), also show that these interventions can lead to distortions in banks’ lend- ing practices. 1 Yetw estill have a rather limited understanding of how these We are especially grateful to the editor, a",

    "title": "Banking Globalization and Monetary",
    "abstract": "Globalization of banking raises questions about banks’ liquidity management, their response to liquidity shocks, and the potential for international shock propagation. We conjecture that global banks manage liquidity on a global scale, actively using cross-border internal funding in response to local shocks. Having global operations insulates banks from changes in monetary policy, while banks without global opera- tions are more affected by monetary policy than previously found. We provide direct evidence that internal capital markets are active in global banks and contribute to the international propagation of shocks. This feature was at play during the ﬁnancial crisis of 2007–2009. AS Financial Markets Have become increasingly globalized, banks have ex- panded their global operations, developing growing networks of physical branches and subsidiaries in foreign countries. We refer to such entities as “global” banks. This changing orientation in banking activity raises important questions about how banks manage their liquidity, how they react to liquidity shocks, and how these shocks may be transmitted across borders. We conjecture that global banks can respond to a domestic liquidity shock by activating a cross- border, internal capital market between the head ofﬁce and its foreign ofﬁces, thus reallocating funds on the basis of relative needs. Because of this potential access to internal capital markets with foreign ofﬁces, lending by global banks is likely to be more insul",

LVI, NO. 2 * April 2001 Banking Market Structure, Financial Dependence and Growth: International Evidence from Industry Data Nicola Cetorelli and Michele Gambera* Absteract This paper explores the empirical relevance of banking market structure on growth. There is substantial evidence of a positive relationship between the level of devel- opment of the banking sector of an economy and its long-run output growth. Little is known, however, about the role played by the market structure of the banking sector on the dynamics of capital accumulation. This paper provides evidence that bank concentration promotes the growth of those industrial sectors that are more in need of external finance by facilitating credit access to younger firms. However, we also find evidence of a general depressing effect on growth associated with a concentrated banking industry, which impacts all sectors and all firms indiscriminately. THE Importance OF Financial Development for economic growth has been ex- tensively analyzed in recent years. The amount of credit that the banking sector makes available for productive uses is one of the most significant measures of financial development. Such an indicator of size of the banking sector has been shown to have a significant, positive effect on growth. In this paper, we study whether, for a given size, the market structure of the banking sector has empirical relevance for economic growth. If it is agreed th",

    "title": "Banking on Deposits: Maturity Transformation",
    "abstract": "We show that maturity transformation does not expose banks to interest rate risk— it hedges it. The reason is the deposit franchise, which allows banks to pay deposit rates that are low and insensitive to market interest rates. Hedging the deposit fran- chise requires banks to earn income that is also insensitive, that is, to lend long term at ﬁxed rates. As predicted by this theory, we show that banks closely match the interest rate sensitivities of their interest income and expense, and that this insu- lates their equity from interest rate shocks. Our results explain why banks supply long-term credit. A Defining Function OF Banks is maturity transformation—borrowing short term and lending long term. This function is important because it sup- plies ﬁrms with long-term credit and households with short-term liquid de- posits. In textbook models, banks engage in maturity transformation to earn the average difference between long-term and short-term rates, that is, to earn the term premium. However, doing so exposes them to interest rate risk: an unexpected increase in the short rate increases banks’ interest expense are also with Nber. Philipp Schnabl is also with Nber and Cepr.

    "title": "Bankruptcy and the Collateral Channel",
    "abstract": "Do bankrupt ﬁrms impose negative externalities on their nonbankrupt competitors? We propose and analyze a collateral channel in which a ﬁrm’s bankruptcy reduces the collateral value of other industry participants, thereby increasing their cost of debt ﬁnancing. We identify the collateral channel using novel data of secured debt tranches issued by U.S. Airlines that include detailed descriptions of the underlying collateral pools. Our estimates suggest that industry bankruptcies have a sizeable impact on the cost of debt ﬁnancing of other industry participants. We discuss how the collateral channel may lead to contagion effects that amplify the business cycle during industry downturns. DO Bankrupt Firms affect their solvent nonbankrupt competitors? Although a and liquidations for those ﬁrms that actually ﬁle for court protection (e.g., Asquith, Gertner, and Scharfstein (1994), Hotchkiss (1995), and Str¨omberg (2000)), little is known about the externalities that bankrupt ﬁrms impose on other ﬁrms operating in the same industry. Any such externalities would be of particular concern, as they may give rise to self-reinforcing feedback loops that amplify the business cycle during industry downturns. Indeed, the potential for contagion effects was of particular concern during the ﬁnancial panic of 2007 to 2009, where insolvent bank liquidations and asset sell offs imposed “ﬁre-sale” externalities on the economy at large (see, e.g., Kashyap, Rajan, and Stein (2008)).

    "title": "Banks as Liquidity Providers:",
    "abstract": "What ties together the traditional commercial banking activities of deposit- taking and lending? We argue that since banks often lend via commitments, their lending and deposit-taking may be two manifestations of one primitive func- tion: the provision of liquidity on demand. There will be synergies between the two activities to the extent that both require banks to hold large balances of liquid assets: If deposit withdrawals and commitment takedowns are imperfectly correlated, the two activities can share the costs of the liquid-asset stockpile. We develop this idea with a simple model, and use a variety of data to test the model empirically. What ARE THE Defining Characteristics of a bank? Both the legal definition in the United States and the standard answer from economists is that com- mercial banks are institutions that engage in two distinct types of activities, one on each side of the balance sheet-deposit-taking and lending. More precisely, deposit-taking involves issuing claims that are riskless and de- mandable, that is, claims that can be redeemed for a fixed value at any time. Lending involves acquiring costly information about opaque borrowers, and extending credit based on this information. A great deal of theoretical and empirical analysis has been devoted to understanding the circumstances under which each of these two activities might require the services of an intermediary, as opposed to being imple- mented in arm's-length securities markets.

    "title": "Banks versus Venture Capital: Project",
    "abstract": "Why do some start-up firms raise funds from banks and others from venture cap- italists? To address this question, I study a model in which the venture capitalist can evaluate the entrepreneur’s project more accurately than the bank but can also threaten to steal it from the entrepreneur. Consistent with evidence regarding venture capital finance, the model implies that the characteristics of a firm financing through venture capitalists are relatively little collateral, high growth, high risk, and high profitability. The model also suggests that tighter protection of intellectual property rights encourages entrepreneurs to finance through venture capitalists. Since 1980 THE U.S. Venture capital industry has grown dramatically. Venture capitalists are known to play a crucial role in incubating new firms by sup- plying them with equity capital. Banks, too, are an important source of funds for new firms. But banks seem slower than venture capitalists in meeting the financial needs of new firms. According to Ueda (2002), indicators of bank lend- ing to small firms are constant or even fall after 1977, whereas venture capital investment is almost 100 times larger in 2001 than it was in 1977. To understand this trend in which venture capital financing has grown sig- nificantly relative to bank financing, I develop a simple model of the trade-offs involved between financing through a bank and through a venture capitalist.

    "abstract": "I study how the secular decline in interest rates affects banks’ intermediation spreads and credit supply. Following a permanent decrease in rates, bank lending may rise initially but contracts in the long run. As lower rates compress deposit spreads even well above the zero lower bound, banks’ retained earnings, equity, and lending fall un- til loan spreads have risen enough to offset the reduction in deposit spreads. A higher inﬂation target can support bank lending at the cost of higher liquidity premia. I ﬁnd support for the model’s predictions in U.S. Aggregate and bank-level data. This Paper Argues That THE secular decline in nominal interest rates tight- ens the long-run supply of bank credit, far before interest rates reach negative territory. Short-run and long-run effects differ: a decrease in interest rates stimulates lending initially, but if interest rates remain low for long, for in- stance, due to a decrease in the steady-state real rate r∗, then lending contracts in the long run. The central mechanism is that lower interest rates compress the deposit spreads earned by banks, due to the competition between money and deposits, which takes place even at positive rates. This implies that contractionary lend- ing effects can appear well before reaching negative rate territory: the thresh- old interest rate below which lower rates hurt lending is not 0%, but rather the positive nominal rate ¯i below which banks cannot earn enough income from deposit spreads to susta",

    "title": "Banks’ Advantage in Hedging Liquidity Risk:",
    "abstract": "Banks have a unique ability to hedge against market-wide liquidity shocks. Deposit inflows provide funding for loan demand shocks that follow declines in market liq- uidity. Consequently, banks can insure firms against systematic declines in liquidity at lower cost than other institutions. We provide evidence that when liquidity dries up and commercial paper spreads widen, banks experience funding inflows. These flows allow banks to meet loan demand from borrowers drawing funds from commer- cial paper backup lines without running down their holdings of liquid assets. We also provide evidence that implicit government support for banks during crises explains these funding flows. During THE Great Depression, investors responded to banking crises by con- verting deposits into currency: Between 1929 and 1933, the ratio of deposits to currency fell from about 12 to less than 5 (Friedman and Schwartz (1963)). This disintermediation resulted in a catastrophic contraction in credit (Bernanke (1983)). In contrast, when crises occur today, we observe reintermediation: In- stead of credit contracting destructively, it changes form. Funds flow from the market to banks (rather than to currency) as investors seek a safe haven for their wealth. At the same time, large firms that normally use commercial paper (CP) for short-term financing and the bond market for long-term credit turn to banks as their “liquidity provider of last resort.” This paper studies the role of banks in offering liquid",

    "abstract": "A large Brazilian agribusiness lender introduces a new contracting technology: grain warehouses. Using runner-up warehouse locations as a control group, I ﬁnd that construction of these warehouses permits a new debt contract, namely, barter credit repayable in grain. This contract increases borrowers’ debt capacity and reduces bor- rowing costs. The effects are stronger when grain price risk is higher, for municipali- ties with weaker courts, and for ﬁnancially constrained borrowers. These ﬁndings are consistent with barter credit reducing ﬁnancial market imperfections by mitigating borrowers’ output price risk. While Financial Markets Play A critical role in fostering economic growth, these markets are characterized by imperfections such as information asym- metry, moral hazard, and limited risk sharing. Existing literature exam- ines various policy interventions, product offerings, and incentive contracts designed to mitigate such market frictions.

Basis-momentum strongly outperforms benchmark characteristics in predicting commodity spot and term premiums in both the time se- ries and the cross section. Exposure to basis-momentum is priced among commodity- sorted portfolios and individual commodities. We argue that basis-momentum cap- tures imbalances in the supply and demand of futures contracts that materialize when the market-clearing ability of speculators and intermediaries is impaired, and that it represents compensation for priced risk. Our ﬁndings are inconsistent with alternative explanations based on storage, inventory, and hedging pressure. IN This Paper, WE Introduce a characteristic derived from the futures term structure, which we refer to as “basis-momentum.” Basis-momentum is directly observable ex ante and is the strongest predictor of commodity returns to date, in the cross section and time series as well as across maturities. A large liter- ature studies stock and bond risk premiums along these dimensions.

    "title": "Bayesian Alphas and Mutual Fund Persistence",
    "abstract": "We use daily returns to compare the performance predictability of Bayesian estimates of mutual fund performance with standard frequentist measures. When the returns on passive nonbenchmark assets are correlated with fund holdings, incorporating his- tories of these returns produces a performance measure that predicts future perfor- mance better than standard measures do. Bayesian alphas based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (capm) are particularly useful for predicting future standard Capm alphas. Over our sample period, priors consistent with moderate to diffuse beliefs in managerial skill dominate more skeptical prior beliefs, a result that is consistent with investor cash flows. Since THE 1960S, THE Academic Literature has analyzed mutual funds with an expanding array of performance measures. The majority of the measures are based on ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation of factor model regressions. In two early studies, Jensen (1968, 1969) uses the single-factor Capital Asset Pricing Model (capm). Subsequently, performance measures based on factor models have evolved along with the empirical asset pricing literature to incorpo- rate passive assets such as size, book-to-market (Fama and French (1993)), and momentum (Jegadeesh and Titman (1993)). See, for example, Ippolito (1989), Elton et al. (1993), and Carhart (1997). Besides relying on least squares re- gression to estimate performance, studies typically use passive asset returns that are contemporaneous with fund",

    "title": "Bayesian Solutions for the Factor Zoo: We Just",
    "abstract": "We propose a novel framework for analyzing linear asset pricing models: simple, robust, and applicable to high-dimensional problems. For a (potentially misspeci- ﬁed) stand-alone model, it provides reliable price of risk estimates for both trad- able and nontradable factors, and detects those weakly identiﬁed. For competing factors and (possibly nonnested) models, the method automatically selects the best speciﬁcation— if a dominant one exists—or provides a Bayesian model averaging– stochastic discount factor (bma-sdf), if there is no clear winner. We analyze 2.25 quadrillion models generated by a large set of factors and ﬁnd that the Bma-sdf outperforms existing models in- and out-of-sample.

    "abstract": "Using hand-collected biographical information on ﬁnancial analysts from 1983 to 2011, we ﬁnd that analysts making forecasts on ﬁrms in industries related to their preanalyst experience have better forecast accuracy, evoke stronger market reactions to earning revisions, and are more likely to be namedInstitutional Investor all-stars. Plausibly exogenous losses of analysts with related industry experience have real ﬁnancial market implications—changes in ﬁrms’ information asymmetry and price reactions are signiﬁcantly larger than those of other analysts. Overall, industry ex- pertise acquired from preanalyst work experience is valuable to analysts, consistent with the emphasis placed on their industry knowledge by institutional investors. Sell-side Analysts ARE AMONGthe most important information agents in cap- to the question of what makes a good sell-side analyst. The literature shows that a number of innate characteristics and external factors such as analysts’ forecasting experience, political views, portfolio complexity, and the prestige of their brokerage house are related to analysts’ performance (Clement (1999), Gilson et al.

    "title": "Behind the Scenes: The Corporate Governance",
    "abstract": "We survey institutional investors to better understand their role in the corporate governance of ﬁrms. Consistent with a number of theories, we document widespread behind-the-scenes intervention as well as governance-motivated exit. These gover- nance mechanisms are viewed as complementary devices, with intervention typically occurring prior to a potential exit. We further ﬁnd that long-term investors and in- vestors that are less concerned about stock liquidity intervene more intensively. Fi- nally, we ﬁnd that most investors use proxy advisors and believe that the information provided by such advisors improves their own voting decisions. Theoretical AND EMPIRICALresearch on corporate governance makes assump- tions and draws inferences about the role of institutional investors. Yet we have little direct knowledge regarding how institutional investors engage with port- folio companies, as many of these interactions occur behind the scenes—unless institutions publicly express their approval or disapproval of a ﬁrm’s activi- ties or management, their preferences and private engagements with portfolio at Austin.

    "abstract": "Using proprietary ﬁnancial data on millions of households, we show that likely- Republicans increased the equity share and market beta of their portfolios following the 2016 presidential election, while likely-Democrats rebalanced into safe assets. We provide evidence that this behavior was driven by investors interpreting public information based on different models of the world. We use detailed controls to rule out the main nonbelief-based channels such as income hedging needs, preferences, and local economic exposures. These ﬁndings are driven by a small share of investors making big changes, and are stronger among investors who trade more ex ante. THE Canonical Assumption IN Most economic models is that people have and the real world, people tend to report different probabilities for the same event, and report updating these beliefs differently in response to common information.1 A leading interpretation of this evidence is that people believe in different models of the world—they hold different and possibly dogmatic priors—which leads them to disagree about baseline probabilities and about the implications of common information for future outcomes.

    "title": "Belief Dispersion in the Stock Market",
    "abstract": "We develop a dynamic model of belief dispersion with a continuum of investors differ- ing in beliefs. The model is tractable and qualitatively matches many of the empirical regularities in a stock price and its mean return, volatility, and trading volume. We ﬁnd that the stock price is convex in cash-ﬂow news and increases in belief dis- persion, while its mean return decreases when the view on the stock is optimistic, and vice versa when pessimistic. Moreover, belief dispersion leads to higher stock volatility and trading volume. We demonstrate that otherwise identical two-investor heterogeneous-beliefs economies do not necessarily generate our main results. THE Empirical Evidence ON THEeffects of investors’ dispersion of beliefs on as- set prices and their dynamics is vast and mixed. For example, several studies ﬁnd a negative relation between belief dispersion and a stock’s mean return (Diether, Malloy, and Scherbina (2002), Chen, Hong, and Stein (2002), Goetz- mann and Massa (2005), Park (2005), Berkman et al. (2009), Yu (2011)). Others argue that the negative relation is valid only for stocks with certain charac- teristics (e.g., small, illiquid, worst-rated or short-sale constrained) and in fact ﬁnd a positive or no signiﬁcant relation (Qu, Starks, and Yan (2003), Doukas, Kim, and Pantzalis (2006), Avramov et al.

    "title": "Beliefs Aggregation and Return Predictability",
    "abstract": "We study return predictability using a model of speculative trading among competitive traders who agree to disagree about the precision of private informa- tion. Although traders apply Bayes’ Law consistently, returns are predictable. In ad- dition to trading on long-term fundamental value, traders also trade on perceived short-term opportunities arising from foreseen future disagreement, as in a Keyne- sian beauty contest. Contradicting conventional wisdom, this short-term speculation dampens price ﬂuctuations and generates time-series momentum. Model calibration shows quantitatively realistic patterns of return dynamics. Consistent with empiri- cal evidence, our model predicts more pronounced momentum for stocks with higher trading volume. Although Researchers Have Documented Short -RUN time-series mo- mentum in equity returns, they have found it notoriously difﬁcult to explain theoretically why this pattern can occur in a competitive market. We present a dynamic model of competitive trading based on ﬂows of new private informa- tion. The model generates time-series momentum endogenously by relaxing the rationality assumption in only a minimal way. As new information arrives, all traders apply Bayes’ Law consistently and optimize correctly, with the single exception that each trader symmetrically assigns a higher precision to his own signal than to other traders’ signals. As a result of this relative overconﬁdence, each trader anticipates that, upon ob- serving new informat",

    "abstract": "We characterize the role of benchmarks in price transparency of over-the-counter markets. A benchmark can raise social surplus by increasing the volume of beneﬁ- cial trade, facilitating more efﬁcient matching between dealers and customers, and reducing search costs. Although the market transparency promoted by benchmarks reduces dealers’ proﬁt margins, dealers may nonetheless introduce a benchmark to encourage greater market participation by investors. Low-cost dealers may also in- troduce a benchmark to increase their market share relative to high-cost dealers. We construct a revelation mechanism that maximizes welfare subject to search frictions, and show conditions under which it coincides with announcing the benchmark. AN Enormous Quantity OF Over-the-counter (OTC) trades are negotiated by counterparties who rely on the observation of benchmark prices. In this paper we explain how benchmarks affect pricing and trading behavior by reducing market opacity, we characterize the welfare impact of benchmarks, and we show how the incentives of regulators and dealers to support benchmarks depend on market structure. Trillions of dollars in loans are negotiated at a spread over Libor or Euri- BOR, benchmark interbank borrowing rates. Libor is the London Interbank Offered Rate.

These ﬁndings are con- sistent with the futures-cash basis reﬂecting liquidity demand that is common to futures and cash equity markets.

    "abstract": "We derive analytical relationships between shock responses and theory-implied causal effects (comparative statics) in dynamic settings with linear proﬁts and linear- quadratic stock accumulation costs. For permanent proﬁtability shocks, responses can have incorrect signs, undershoot, or overshoot depending on the size and sign of realized changes. For proﬁtability shocks that are i.i.d., uniformly distributed, bi- nary, or unanticipated and temporary, there is attenuation bias, which exceeds 50% under plausible parameterizations. We derive a novel sufﬁcient condition for prof- itability shock responses to equal causal effects: martingale proﬁtability. We estab- lish a battery of sufﬁcient conditions for correct sign estimation, including stochastic monotonicity. Simple extrapolation/error correction formulas are presented. IN Applied Microeconomics Fields such as corporate ﬁnance,theory-implied causal effects are generally derived using comparative statics. For instance, as Heckman (2000) writes, “Comparative statics exercises formalize Marshall’s notion of a ceteris paribus change which is what economists mean by a causal effect.” Athey, Milgrom, and Roberts (1998) similarly observe that “most of the testable implications of economic theory are comparative static predictions.” In assessing implications of tradeoff theory, Welch (2010) states that “The comparative statics analysis are simple and obvious: The ﬁrm should have more debt if the interest rate is higher, if the cor",

    "abstract": "We construct a neural network algorithm that generates price predictions for art at auction, relying on both visual and nonvisual object characteristics. We ﬁnd that higher automated valuations relative to auction house presale estimates are as- sociated with substantially higher price-to-estimate ratios and lower buy-in rates, pointing to estimates’ informational inefﬁciency. The relative contribution of machine learning is higher for artists with less dispersed and lower average prices. Further- more, we show that auctioneers’ prediction errors are persistent both at the artist and at the auction house level, and hence directly predictable themselves using in- formation on past errors. Auction Houses DO NOT Simply match consignors to bidders. They also act as brokers of information. In particular, they publicly communicate market value estimates of the lots for sale. While auction theory suggests that “hon- esty is the best policy” (Milgrom and Weber ( 1982)), at least for a monopolistic auctioneer, there are good reasons to think that presale estimates may not be unbiased. In particular, art and other collectibles’ illiquidity and hetero- geneity make the task of valuation far from obvious (Chambers, Dimson, and Spaenjers (2020)), and both behavioral frictions and strategic-competitive con- siderations can impact auction houses’ proclaimed valuations.

    "abstract": "We structurally estimate a model in which agents’ information processing biases can cause predictability in ﬁrms’ asset returns and investment inefﬁciencies. We gener- alize the neoclassical investment model by allowing for two biases—overconﬁdence and overextrapolation of trends—that distort agents’ expectations of ﬁrm productiv- ity. Our model’s predictions closely match empirical data on asset pricing and ﬁrm behavior. The estimated bias parameters are well identiﬁed and exhibit plausible magnitudes. Alternative models without either bias or with efﬁcient investment fail to match observed return predictability and ﬁrm behavior. These results suggest that biases affect ﬁrm behavior, which in turn affects return anomalies. There IS Disagreement Over how much predictability in ﬁrms’ asset returns comes from mispricing rather than risk premiums. On one side of this dispute, several researchers evaluate the merits of risk-based explanations usingstruc- tural modeling and estimation.1 On the other side, although numerous models of mispricing have been proposed, there have been no attempts to structurally estimate behavioral biases or link return anomalies to ﬁrm behavior. 2 Thus, we lack a clear answer to basic questions of model ﬁt, parameter identiﬁcation, parameter plausibility, and the economics of mispricing.

    "title": "Bidding into the Red: A Model of Post-Auction",
    "abstract": "This paper investigates auctions where bidders have limited liability. First, we analyze bidding behavior under different auction formats, showing that the second-price auc- tion induces higher prices, higher bankruptcy rates, and lower utilities than the first- price auction. Second, we show that the cost of bankruptcy critically affects the seller’s preference over the choice of auction. If bankruptcy is very costly, the seller prefers the first-price auction over the second-price auction. Alternatively, if the bankrupt assets are resold among the losers of the initial auction, the seller prefers the second-price auction. Auctions ARE Becoming AN Ever More Popular way to allocate important, large- scale property rights. A major concern in such large auctions is that agents may bid aggressively, anticipating that they can declare bankruptcy if the good is worth less than expected. This problem is frequently encountered when selling large assets. For example, ITV Digital went bankrupt after aggressively bid- ding for the right to broadcast Football League games, owing £178m. Default is also common in procurement auctions. For example, Connex’s rail franchise for southeast England was taken over by the government after it demanded ex- tra subsidies to continue operating. These examples illustrate the prevalence of post-auction bankruptcy and provide a cautionary tale: As auction mecha- nisms become an increasingly useful tool for both government and industry, the possibility o",

    "title": "Bids and Allocations in European IPO",
    "abstract": "This paper uses evidence from a data set of 27 European IPOs to analyze how investors bid and the factors that influence their allocations. We also make use of a unique ranking of investor quality, associated with the likelihood of flipping the IPO. We find that investors perceived to be long-term holders of the stock are consistently favored in allocation and in out-turn profits. In contrast to Cornelli and Goldreich (2001), we find little evidence that more informative bids receive larger allocations or higher profits. Our results cast doubt upon the extent of information production during the bookbuilding period. There remains very little evidence on how the bidding and allocation process operates in practice in book-built offerings. There is a very good reason for this: the information that would be required—on the individual bids submitted by each investor, as well as the allocations of shares to investors—is propri- etary information that investment banks are loathe to reveal. Indeed, recent investigations by the SEC and others into the allocation practices of certain in- vestment banks have only served to enhance the sensitivity of this information. Yet without such details of the IPO process, it remains difficult to test, at least in a direct way, the theoretical explanations of phenomena such as the system- atic underpricing of IPOs.

    "abstract": "We assess the impact of bank deregulation on the distribution of income in the United States. From the 1970s through the 1990s, most states removed restrictions on intrastate branching, which intensiﬁed bank competition and improved bank per- formance. Exploiting the cross-state, cross-time variation in the timing of branch deregulation, we ﬁnd that deregulation materially tightened the distribution of in- come by boosting incomes in the lower part of the income distribution while having little impact on incomes above the median. Bank deregulation tightened the distribu- tion of income by increasing the relative wage rates and working hours of unskilled workers. Income Distributional Considerations have played a central—if not the central—role in shaping the policies that govern ﬁnancial markets. For in- stance, Thomas Jefferson’s fears that concentrated banking power would help wealthy industrialists at the expense of others spurred him to ﬁght against the Bank of the United States, and similar anxieties fueled Andrew Jackson’s veto of the re-chartering of the Second Bank of the United States (Hammond (1957), Bodenhorn (2003)). During the 20th century, politicians in many U.S. States implemented and maintained restrictions on bank branching, arguing that the formation of large banks would disproportionately curtail the economic oppor- tunities of the poor (Southworth (1928), White (1982), Kroszner and Strahan (1999)).

    "abstract": "This paper analyzes how blockholders can exert governance even if they cannot inter- vene in a firm’s operations. Blockholders have strong incentives to monitor the firm’s fundamental value because they can sell their stakes upon negative information. By trading on private information (following the “Wall Street Rule”), they cause prices to reflect fundamental value rather than current earnings. This in turn encourages managers to invest for long-run growth rather than short-term profits. Contrary to the view that the U.S.’s liquid markets and transient shareholders exacerbate myopia, I show that they can encourage investment by impounding its effects into prices. The nature of competition has changed, placing a premium on investment in increasingly complex and intangible forms—the kinds of investment most penalized by the U.S. [capital allocation] system. —Porter (1992) This Paper ANALYZEShow outside blockholders can induce managers to undertake efficient real investment through their informed trading of the firm’s shares. By gathering information about a firm’s fundamental value and impounding it into prices, they encourage managers to undertake investment that increases long-run value even if it reduces interim profits. The model therefore addresses two broad issues. First, it introduces a potential solution to managerial myopia. Second, it demonstrates that shareholders can add significant value even if they cannot intervene in a firm’s operations. This may explain the pr",

    "abstract": "This study documents a new value-added role of venture capitalists and addresses important questions about how resources are combined to create firms. As part of the nexus of contracts surrounding a firm, strategic alliances can be viewed as relational contracts that blur firm boundaries. This paper provides evidence that alliances are more frequent among companies sharing a common venture capitalist. The effect is concentrated in alliances in which contracting problems are more pronounced, con- sistent with venture capitalists utilizing informational and other advantages in pro- viding resources to firms. Further, these alliances improve the probability of exit for venture-backed firms. Modern Corporate Finance Increasingly Recognizes the importance of under- standing the role of the theory of the firm as it relates to financing decisions. As relational contracts that lie between the boundaries of a single firm and market transactions, strategic alliances are part of the nexus of contracts that surround a firm and can be an important source of value (Jensen and Meckling (1976)). This paper provides evidence that strategic alliances are disproportion- ately more frequent between companies that share a common venture capital investor and that venture-backed portfolio firms with these strategic alliances are associated with a higher probability of successful exit.

    "title": "Board Seat Accumulation by Executives:",
    "abstract": "While reformers have argued that multiple directorships for executives can destroy value, we investigate firms with executives that accept an outside directorship and find negative announcement returns only when the executive’s firm has greater agency problems. When fewer agency concerns exist, additional directorships relate to increased firm value. Announcement returns are also higher when executives ac- cept an outside directorship in a financial, high-growth, or related-industry firm. Our results suggest that outside directorships for executives can enhance firm value, which has important implications for firms employing executives nominated for out- side boards and for policy recommendations restricting the number of directorships. Corporate Governance Failures have been blamed for the recent losses of share- holder value in a number of companies including Enron, Global Crossing, and MCI-Worldcom. One common criticism of the existing system is that corporate boards have too few independent outside directors. In a recent response to this criticism, the New York Stock Exchange has adopted listing requirements that require firms to have a majority of independent directors. According to a sur- vey by Spencer Stuart, active CEOs and other executives of publicly traded firms remain the most desired candidates for firms seeking new outside direc- tors (see Spencer Stuart Board Index (2003)). To the extent that an executive’s primary employer implicitly or explicitly permits the",

    "abstract": "We use novel data from a leading online job search platform to examine the impact of corporate distress on ﬁrms’ ability to attract job applicants. Survey responses suggest that job seekers accurately perceive ﬁrms’ ﬁnancial condition, as measured by companies’ credit default swap prices and accounting data. Analyzing responses to job postings by major ﬁnancial ﬁrms during the Great Recession, we ﬁnd that an increase in an employer’s distress results in fewer and lower quality applicants. These effects are particularly evident when the social safety net provides workers with weak A Company’s Financial CONDITIONhas far-reaching effects on the ﬁrm, including on its ability to attract and retain human capital. Corporate distress can lead current employees to search for more stable positions and new recruits to focus their searches elsewhere. Concerns about short-run solvency strain a ﬁrm’s reputation for treating employees fairly (Maksimovic and Titman (1991)), and corporate distress often leads ﬁrms to pay lower wages (Graham et al.

Average employment decreases by 10% around a bond covenant violation (Falato and Liang (2014)), by 27% around a bond default (Agrawal and Matsa (2013)), and by 50% or more around a bankruptcy ﬁling (Hotchkiss (1995)).

    "title": "Bond Insurance: What Is Special About Munis?",
    "abstract": "Close to 50% of municipal bonds are prepackaged with insurance at the time of issue. We offer a tax-based rationale for the emergence of third-party insurance of tax-exempt bonds. We argue that insurance adds value as it allows a third party to become, in a probabilistic sense, an issuer of tax-exempt securities. Insurance however reduces value by eliminating the possibility of a capital tax loss. While the net benefit from insurance increases with bond maturity, the benefit may not increase monoton- ically with default risk. We also provide empirical evidence supportive of the model’s predictions. AS With Security Markets Everywhere , new financial products and institutional arrangements have radically altered the nature of the municipal bond market. A major development is the explosive growth in insurance for municipal bonds, in which a third-party insurer promises to step in and make timely payments to the bondholder in the event of a default. From humble beginnings in the 1980s, insurance is now commonly provided and about 50% of municipal bonds are prepackaged with insurance at the time of issue. Insurance can also be purchased directly by investors. Our objective in the paper is to understand why it is attractive for municipalities to issue bonds bundled with third-party insurance. We show that the demand for insuring municipal bonds can be attributed, at least in part, to an indirect form of tax-arbitrage. Critical to our argument is the fact that unlike other forms of",

    "title": "Bondholder Wealth Effects in Mergers",
    "abstract": "We examine the wealth effects of mergers and acquisitions on target and acquiring firm bondholders in the 1980s and 1990s. Consistent with a coinsurance effect, below investment grade target bonds earn significantly positive announcement period re- turns. By contrast, acquiring firm bonds earn negative announcement period returns. Additionally, target bonds have significantly larger returns when the target’s rating is below the acquirer’s, when the combination is anticipated to decrease target risk or leverage, and when the target’s maturity is shorter than the acquirer’s. Finally, we find that target and acquirer announcement period bond returns are significantly larger in the 1990s. U.S. Companies Announced 8,309 mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in 2001. The value of these deals exceeded $700 billion. This actually represents a decline in M&A activity, which saw 10,833 deals worth $1.28 trillion in 2000 and total deals worth $1.4 trillion and $1.2 trillion in 1999 and 1998. 1 Given the signifi- cance of M&A activity, an important question is: Do mergers create value, and if so, for whom? The existing literature thoroughly documents the wealth effects experienced by target and acquirer stockholders, but there is limited evidence on the wealth effects experienced by bondholders. 2 The purpose of this study is to fill this gap by examining the effects of 940 mergers and acquisitions on the value of 3,901 target and acquirer bonds during the period from 1979 to 1997.

    "title": "Book-to-Market Equity, Distress Risk,",
    "abstract": "This paper examines the relationship between book-to-market equity, distress risk, and stock returns. Among firms with the highest distress risk as proxied by Ohl- son's (1980) 0-score, the difference in returns between high and low book-to- market securities is more than twice as large as that in other firms. This large return differential cannot be explained by the three-factor model or by differences in economic fundamentals. Consistent with mispricing arguments, firms with high distress risk exhibit the largest return reversals around earnings announcements, and the book-to-market effect is largest in small firms with low analyst coverage. ONE Prominent Explanation OF THE book-to-market equity premium in returns is that high book-to-market equity firms are assigned a higher risk premium because of the greater risk of distress.1 Consistent with this view, Fama and French (1995) and Chen and Zhang (1998) show that firms with high book- to-market equity (be/me) have persistently low earnings, higher financial leverage, more earnings uncertainty, and are more likely to cut dividends compared to their low Be/me counterparts. In contrast, Dichev (1998) uses measures of bankruptcy risk proposed by Ohlson (1980) and Altman (1968) to identify firms with a high likelihood of financial distress and finds that these firms tend to have low average stock returns. Dichev's results appear to be inconsistent with the view that firms with high Be/me earn high returns as a premium for distr",

    "title": "Bookbuilding and Strategic Allocation",
    "abstract": "In the bookbuilding procedure, an investment banker solicits bids for shares from institutional investors prior to pricing an equity issue. The banker then prices the issue and allocates shares at his discretion to the investors. We examine the books for 39 international equity issues. We find that the investment banker awards more shares to bidders who provide information in their bids. Regular investors receive favorable allocations, especially when the issue is heavily oversubscribed. The investment banker also favors revised bids and domestic investors. Investment Banks Commonly “build A Book ” before pricing an equity issue. In the United States, it has been standard practice for a number of years. In many other countries where fixed-price offerings were traditionally used, the bookbuilding procedure is becoming increasingly common, especially for international equity issues. Under the formal bookbuilding procedure, the investment banker solicits indications of interest from institutional investors. Such indications consist of a bid for a quantity of shares and might include a maximum price ~i.e., a limit price! Or other details. The investment banker uses the information to construct a demand curve. The issue price is not set according to any explicit rule, but rather based on the banker’s interpretation of investors’ indications of interest. He generally sets the price at a level at which demand exceeds supply, and then allocates shares to the bidders at his discretion",

    "abstract": "We examine the institutional bids submitted under the bookbuilding proce- dure for a sample of international equity issues. We find that information in bids which include a limit price, especially those of large and frequent bid- ders, affects the issue price. Oversubscription has a smaller but significant effect for IPOs. Public information affects the issue price to the extent that it is reflected in the bids. Oversubscription and demand elasticity are positively correlated with the first-day aftermarket return, and demand elasticity is negatively correlated with aftermarket volatility. Our results support the view that bookbuilding is designed to extract information from investors. Investment Banks Acting AS Underwriters in securities offerings conduct the pre- liminary analysis, choose the offer price, allocate the shares, and stabilize the aftermarket price. In this paper, we focus on one of the crucial roles of the under- writer, bookbuilding, and investigate its purpose. In the bookbuilding procedure, before setting the issue price for an equity of- fering, the investment bank announces an indicative price range and institu- tional investors submit bids for shares. Each bid is a request for a quantity of shares, and may include a limit price. Once the bookbuilding process is con- cluded, the investment bank aggregates the bids into a demand curve and chooses the issue price. Thus, the investment banker has a considerable amount of information available at the time he c",

    "title": "Borrow Cheap, Buy High? The Determinants",
    "abstract": "Private equity funds pay particular attention to capital structure when executing leveraged buyouts, creating an interesting setting for examining capital structure theories. Using a large, international sample of buyouts from 1980 to 2008, we ﬁnd that buyout leverage is unrelated to the cross-sectional factors, suggested by tradi- tional capital structure theories, that drive public ﬁrm leverage. Instead, variation in economy-wide credit conditions is the main determinant of leverage in buyouts. Higher deal leverage is associated with higher transaction prices and lower buyout fund returns, suggesting that acquirers overpay when access to credit is easier. “We buy stuff with cheap debt and arbitrage on the difference with equity markets.” (Guy Hands, founding partner of the private equity ﬁrm Terra Firma, Financial Times, November 15, 2007) Private Equity Investors are expert, repeat, and largely ﬁnancially moti- vated players in capital markets. Over a career executing leveraged buyouts (LBOs), they arguably make more decisions about ﬁrm capital structure than any other agents in the economy. 1 Hence, private equity investors’ ﬁnancing choices are potentially informative about theories of optimal capital structure. Yet, unlike publicly traded ﬁrms, we know little about what determines lever- age and pricing in these buyouts. In this paper, we ﬁll this gap by documenting the factors that affect the ﬁnancial structure of private equity–backed buyout ﬁrms in detail, and we con",

    "title": "Borrower Misreporting and Loan Performance",
    "abstract": "Borrower misreporting is associated with seriously adverse loan outcomes. Signiﬁ- cantly more residential mortgage borrowers reported personal assets just above round number thresholds than just below. Borrowers who reported above-threshold assets were almost 25 percentage points more likely to become delinquent (mean delin- quency was 20%). For applicants with unveriﬁed assets, the increase in delinquency was greater than 40 percentage points. Misreporting was most frequent in areas with low ﬁnancial literacy or social capital. Incorporating behavioral cues such as thresh- old effects into a risk assessment model improves its ability to uncover delinquencies, though at a cost of mischaracterizing some safe loans. Risk Assessment AND Control are core functions of ﬁnancial institutions. In transactions with retail clients, one strategy for loss mitigation is to identify behavioral patterns or cues associated with worse outcomes that can be in- corporated into risk models. The importance of better delinquency models in sectors such as the residential mortgage market has been brought into stark relief by the events of the recent ﬁnancial crisis. The use of new behavioral- based risk measurement tools may lead to more successful lending results and help support the long-run stability and performance of ﬁnancial institutions.

The effects are weaker when there are too many employees to mitigate free-riding.

Our instrumental variables estimates show that internet use causes a substantial increase in stock market participation, driven primarily by increased fund ownership. Existing investors tilt their portfolios toward funds, thereby obtain- ing more diversiﬁed portfolios and higher Sharpe ratios, and do not increase their trading activity in stocks. Overall, access to high-speed internet spurs a “democra- tization of ﬁnance,” with individuals making investment decisions that are more in line with the advice from portfolio theory .

    "abstract": "Using trade-level data, we study whether brokers play a role in spreading order ﬂow information in the stock market. We focus on large portfolio liquidations that result in temporary price drops, and identify the brokers who intermediate these trades. These brokers’ clients are more likely to predate on the liquidating funds than to provide liquidity. Predation leads to proﬁts of about 25 basis points over 10 days and increases the liquidation costs of the distressed fund by 40%. This evidence suggests a role of information leakage in exacerbating ﬁre sales. “large Institutional Orders” ARE Typically split into smaller amounts over time to avoid moving the market (see Garleanu and Pedersen (2013), Di Mascio, Lines, and Naik (2016)). One concern when executing an order over time is that other traders might anticipate the intent to trade the stock in the near future and trade in the same direction to beneﬁt from the future price impact. This problem is particularly pronounced in the case of ﬁre sales, during which the seller is forced to bring to the market a large quantity of assets in a limited amount of time (Coval and Stafford (2007), Ellul, Jotikasthira, and Lundblad (2011)). Moreover, if the liquidation occurs during a time of market stress, predatory trading can make the market more illiquid and amplify adverse shocks (Greenwood, Landier, and Thesmar (2015)).

    "abstract": "I study how brokers distort household investment decisions. Using a novel convert- ible bond data set, I ﬁnd that consumers often purchase dominated bonds—cheap and expensive otherwise-identical bonds coexist in the market. Brokers are incentivized to sell the dominated bonds, typically earning two times greater fees for selling them. I develop and estimate a broker-intermediated search model that rationalizes this behavior. The estimates indicate that costly search is a key friction in ﬁnancial mar- kets, but the effects of search costs are compounded when brokers are incentivized to direct the search of consumers toward high-fee inferior products.

    "title": "Business Groups and Tunneling: Evidence",
    "abstract": "We examine whether equity-linked private securities offerings are used as a mecha- nism for tunneling among firms that belong to a Korean chaebol. We find that chaebol issuers involved in intragroup deals set the offering prices to benefit their controlling shareholders. We also find that chaebol issuers (member acquirers) realize an 8.8% (5.8%) higher (lower) announcement return than do other types of issuers (acquirers) if they sell private securities at a premium to other member firms, and if the con- trolling shareholders receive positive net gains from equity ownership in issuers and acquirers. These results are consistent with tunneling within business groups. THE Widespread USE OF Pyramid Ownership structures and cross-holdings among firms that belong to a business group allows controlling shareholders to exer- cise full control over a firm despite holding a relatively small portion of its cash flow rights. 1 This divergence between ownership and control raises concerns about the degree to which the controlling shareholders of the business group siphon resources out of firms to increase their wealth, that is, the degree to which the controlling shareholders engage in tunneling (Johnson et al. (2000)). Although tunneling creates both a severe agency problem between controlling and minority shareholders and a serious friction that affects the efficient func- tioning of the capital market, systematic evidence of its existence is scarce.

    "abstract": "Business connections can mitigate agency conflicts by facilitating efficient informa- tion transfers, but can also be channels for inefficient favoritism. I analyze these two effects in the mutual fund industry and find that fund directors and advisory firms that manage the funds hire each other preferentially based on the intensity of their past interactions. I do not find evidence that stronger board-advisor ties correspond to better or worse outcomes for fund shareholders. These results suggest that the two effects of board-management connections on investor welfare—improved monitoring and increased potential for collusion—balance out in this setting. THE U.s.mutual Fund Industry manages more than $12 trillion on behalf of 44% of American households.1 While the importance of the industry has increased steadily since its regulation by the Investment Company Act of 1940, it still faces a fundamental principal-agent problem. In particular, the investment ad- visory firms that manage mutual funds’ money do not have the same incentives as the fund shareholders: Advisory firms’ profit is generated by collecting man- agement fees, which are typically a percentage of assets under management, whereas investors’ profit is generated by funds earning high returns. Recog- nizing this conflict of interests, the 1940 Act required that mutual funds have boards of directors that are elected by shareholders and responsible for moni- toring and negotiating with the management on behalf of in",

From the full text of 800,000Wall Street Journal articles for 1984 to 2017, we estimate a topic model that summarizes business news into inter- pretable topical themes and quantiﬁes the proportion of news attention allocated to each theme over time. News attention closely tracks a wide range of economic ac- tivities and can forecast aggregate stock market returns. A text-augmented vector autoregression demonstrates the large incremental role of news text in forecasting macroeconomic dynamics. We retrieve the narratives that underlie these improve- ments in market and business cycle forecasts. A Central Function OF THE economics profession is measuring the state of the economy and developing models that link these measurements to distri- butions of future outcomes. This arms consumers, investors, and policymakers with the information and structural context necessary to allocate resources efﬁciently . But the economy is a complex system whose current state deﬁes simple measurement: vast resources, both public and private, are devoted to measuring the many facets of economic activity .1 Researchers routinely discussions and comments from George-Marios Angeletos; Scott Baker; Nick Bloom; Steve Davis; Rob Engle; Xavier Gabaix; Will Goetzmann; Toby Moskowitz; Lasse Pedersen; Jesse Shapiro; Bob Shiller; Alp Simsek; and participants at many seminars and conferences.

    "abstract": "Firms in bilateral relationships are likely to produce or procure unique products— especially when they are in durable goods industries. Consistent with the arguments of Titman and Titman and Wessels, such firms are likely to maintain lower leverage. We compile a database of firms’ principal customers (those that account for at least 10% of sales or are otherwise considered important for business) from the Business Information File of Compustat and find results consistent with the predictions of this theory. Over THE Past TWO Decades , a literature has evolved to address how a firm’s relationship with its stakeholders affects overall corporate strategy, including its capital structure choice. An important aspect of that relationship is the interaction between a firm and its customers and suppliers. Titman (1984) and Titman and Wessels (1988) argue that a firm’s customers face switching costs in the event the firm is liquidated, and that these costs are especially high when the firm’s products are unique because they induce specific investments by the customers (see also Grinblatt and Titman (2002)). These costs affect the firm’s optimal capital structure. Maksimovic and Titman (1991) further argue that a firm’s incentive to maintain product quality is less if it faces the prospect of liquidation, and that this may cause the firm to lose customers concerned about product quality. To date, however, little empirical evidence exists on how buyer–supplier re- lationships shape the",

    "title": "Buyout Activity: The Impact of Aggregate",
    "abstract": "Buyout booms form in response to declines in the aggregate risk premium. We doc- ument that the equity risk premium is the primary determinant of buyout activity rather than credit-speciﬁc conditions. We articulate a simple explanation for this phe- nomenon: a low risk premium increases the present value of performance gains and decreases the cost of holding an illiquid investment. A panel of U.S. Buyouts conﬁrms this view. The risk premium shapes changes in buyout characteristics over the cy- cle, including their riskiness, leverage, and performance. Our results underscore the importance of the risk premium in corporate ﬁnance decisions. Since Their Emergence IN THE1980s, buyouts have been a powerful means to alter ﬁrm incentives. But the use of buyouts has varied widely over time. In the United States, peak years experience close to 100 public-to-private buyout transactions while trough years experience as few as 10. We propose a simple explanation for these ﬂuctuations: buyout activity responds to changes in the aggregate risk premium. The discount rate affects ﬁrm valuations and in turn the decision of whether to engage in a buyout deal. We document that this integrated view of capital markets provides a detailed and powerful account of buyout cyclicality. Our elementary explanation is in stark contrast to existing literature that focuses on the role of credit-speciﬁc conditions. Empirically, variation in buyout activity is better explained by changes in the risk premium",

    "title": "CEO Compensation and Board Structure",
    "abstract": "In response to corporate scandals in 2001 and 2002, major U.S. Stock exchanges issued new board requirements to enhance board oversight. We find a significant decrease in CEO compensation for firms that were more affected by these requirements, compared with firms that were less affected, taking into account unobservable firm effects, time-varying industry effects, size, and performance. The decrease in compensation is particularly pronounced in the subset of affected firms with no outside blockholder on the board and in affected firms with low concentration of institutional investors. Our results suggest that the new board requirements affected CEO compensation decisions. IN Modern Corporations, the decision of how to compensate the manager is dele- gated to the board of directors. In recent years, experts have debated the impor- tance of this delegation mechanism in affecting CEO compensation. On the one hand, many scholars point to the labor market for talent as the major force that determines the level and design of compensation contracts (e.g., Rosen (1990), Himmelberg and Hubbard (2000), Hubbard (2005), Gabaix and Landier (2008)). On the other hand, a number of scholars argue that the delegation mechanism has a crucial effect on CEO compensation, and that board decisions with re- spect to compensation can deviate considerably from labor market values (e.g., Fama (1980), Fama and Jensen (1983), Jensen (1993), Hall and Murphy (2003), Bebchuk and Fried (2003, 2004)).

    "abstract": "Chhaochharia and Grinstein estimate that CEO pay decreases 17% more in ﬁrms that were not compliant with the recent NYSE/Nasdaq board independence require- ment than in ﬁrms that were compliant. We document that 74% of this magnitude is attributable to two outliers of 865 sample ﬁrms. In addition, we ﬁnd that the compen- sation committee independence requirement increases CEO total pay, particularly in the presence of effective shareholder monitoring. Our evidence casts doubt on the effectiveness of independent directors in constraining CEO pay as suggested by the managerial power hypothesis. Whether Board Composition Affects executive pay has been the subject of debate for decades. Proponents of the managerial power hypothesis (e.g., Bebchuk, Fried, and Walker (2002)) argue that managers’ inﬂuence over their directors allows them to extract rents, for example, through excessive pay. An implication of the theory is that making boards more independent from man- agement is key to improving corporate governance. The spectacular rise in executive pay over the 1990s has made the managerial power hypothesis, with all its implications, a popular view among politicians, regulators, academics, and the media. In the wake of the accounting scandals that led to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Nyse and Nasdaq revised their listing standards to improve corporate governance.

    "abstract": "CEO compensation can influence the kinds of strategies that firms adopt. We argue that performance-related compensation creates an incentive to look for overly ambi- tious, hard to implement strategies. At a cost, shareholders can curb this tendency by precommitting to a regime of CEO overcompensation in highly changeable environ- ments. Alternatively shareholders can commit to low CEO pay, although this requires a commitment mechanism (either by the board of the individual company, or by the society as a whole) to counter the incentive to renegotiate upwards. We study the conditions under which the different policies for CEO compensation are preferred by shareholders. We have created a cult of leadership that far exceeds anything that ex- isted decades ago... What we are getting now, very dangerously, is what I call a dramatic style of managing; the great merger, the great down- sizing, the massive brilliant new strategy... So we get all these massive mergers, fire, brimstone and drama, because you can’t say to the stock an- alysts, “we’re getting our logistics all straightened out, we’re going to be much more efficient at throughput to the customer.” They start to yawn.

    "abstract": "We ﬁnd that connections CEOs develop with top executives and directors through their appointment decisions increase the risk of corporate fraud. Appointment-based CEO connectedness in executive suites and boardrooms increases the likelihood of committing fraud and decreases the likelihood of detection. Additionally, it de- creases the expected costs of fraud by helping conceal fraudulent activity, making CEO dismissal less likely upon discovery, and lowering the coordination costs of carrying out illegal activity. Connections based on network ties through past employ- ment, education, or social organization memberships have insigniﬁcant effects on fraud. Appointment-based CEO connectedness warrants attention from regulators, investors, and corporate governance specialists.

    "abstract": "This paper studies optimal contracts when managers manipulate their performance measure at the expense of ﬁrm value. Optimal contracts defer compensation. The manager’s incentives vest over time at an increasing rate, and compensation becomes very sensitive to short-term performance. This generates an endogenous horizon prob- lem whereby managers intensify performance manipulation in their ﬁnal years in of- ﬁce. Contracts are designed to encourage effort while minimizing the adverse effects of manipulation. We characterize the optimal mix of short- and long-term compensa- tion along the manager’s tenure, the optimal vesting period of incentive pay, and the dynamics of short-termism over the CEO’s tenure. Short-termism IS Prevalent Among Managers. Graham, Harvey, and Rajgopal (2005) ﬁnd that 78% of U.S. CEOs are willing to sacriﬁce long-term value to beat market expectations. For example, Dechow and Sloan (1991) argue that, by the end of their tenure, CEOs tend to cut R&D investment, which, though proﬁtable, has negative implications for the ﬁrm’s reported earnings. Managerial short-termism has been the suspect of concern for many years, but it has assumed a particularly prominent role in recent years following the Enron scandal and the ﬁnancial crisis in 2008. To understand this phenomenon, the theoretical literature has adopted two approaches. One approach studies CEO behavior, taking managerial incentives as given, and thus is silent about optimal incentives (see, e.g., Ste",

    "abstract": "Weargue that managerial overconfidence can account for corporate investment distor- tions. Overconfident managers overestimate the returns to their investment projects and view external funds as unduly costly. Thus, they overinvest when they have abun- dant internal funds, but curtail investment when they require external financing. We test the overconfidence hypothesis, using panel data on personal portfolio and corpo- rate investment decisions of Forbes 500 CEOs. We classify CEOs as overconfident if they persistently fail to reduce their personal exposure to company-specific risk. We find that investment of overconfident CEOs is significantly more responsive to cash flow, particularly in equity-dependent firms. IN This Paper , WE Argue That Personal characteristics of CEOs in large corpo- rations lead to distortions in corporate investment policies. In particular, we study the investment decisions of CEOs who overestimate the future returns of their companies, measured by a failure to divest company-specific risk on their personal accounts. We find that overconfident CEOs have a heightened sensitiv- ity of corporate investment to cash flow, particularly among equity-dependent firms. The two traditional explanations for investment distortions are the misalign- ment of managerial and shareholders interests (Jensen and Meckling (1976); Jensen (1986)) and asymmetric information between corporate insiders and the capital market (Myers and Majluf (1984)).

A strategy based on public information about managerial ownership delivers annual abnormal returns of 4% to 10%. The effect is strongest among ﬁrms with weak exter- nal governance, weak product market competition, and large managerial discretion, suggesting that CEO ownership can reverse the negative impact of weak governance. Furthermore, owner-CEOs are value increasing: they reduce empire building and run their ﬁrms more efﬁciently . Overall, our ﬁndings indicate that the market does not correctly price the incentive effects of managerial ownership, suggesting interesting feedback effects between corporate ﬁnance and asset pricing.

    "abstract": "Maintaining economic output during the Covid-19 pandemic results in beneﬁts for ﬁrm shareholders but comes at a potential cost to public health. Using store-level data, we examine how a CEO’s political leaning impacts this trade-off. We document that ﬁrms with a Republican-leaning CEO experience a relative increase in store visits compared to ﬁrms with a Democratic-leaning CEO. The increase in store visits is associated with higher sales and positive abnormal stock returns. However, we also document higher Covid-19 transmission rates and more employee safety complaints in communities where establishments with higher store trafﬁc are managed by a Republican-leaning CEO. THE Costs AND Benefits OF National , state, and local policies intended to inhibit the transmission of Covid-19 and protect public health are the sub- ject of ongoing debate in the United States. At the heart of this debate is the trade-off between the beneﬁts of opening up an economy and the potential risks to public health.

    "abstract": "This paper explores the impact of target CEOs’ retirement preferences on takeovers. Using retirement age as a proxy for CEOs’ private merger costs, we ﬁnd strong evi- dence that target CEOs’ preferences affect merger activity. The likelihood of receiving a successful takeover bid is sharply higher when target CEOs are close to age 65. Takeover premiums and target announcement returns are similar for retirement-age and younger CEOs, implying that retirement-age CEOs increase ﬁrm sales without sacriﬁcing premiums. Better corporate governance is associated with more acquisi- tions of ﬁrms led by young CEOs, and with a smaller increase in deals at retirement age. From 1990 TO 2012, Close TO 9,700 public U.S. ﬁrms were acquired. For the 6,418 target ﬁrms with available data, target shareholders received a median premium of 36% over the pre-announcement share price, and the total value increase for all target ﬁrms combined was about $1.7 trillion. These magnitudes suggest that the takeover market has great potential to create shareholder value. This paper provides evidence that the career concerns and retirement preferences of target ﬁrms’ CEOs affect takeover decisions, leading to outcomes that are unlikely to be in target shareholders’ best interest. Target ﬁrm CEOs are arguably among the most important actors in the takeover market. These CEOs play a key role in their ﬁrm’s decisions leading up to a bid (e.g., the decision to seek out a buyer, or to initiate merger talks), and,",

    "title": "CEO Turnover after Acquisitions: Are Bad",
    "abstract": "We examine the relation between bidder returns and the probability of chief executive officer (CEO) turnover in acquiring firms. Using a sample of 714 acquisitions during 1990 to 1998, we find that 47% of CEOs of acquiring firms are replaced within 5 years, including 27% by internal governance, 16% by takeovers, and 4% by bankruptcy. A significant inverse relation exists between bidder returns and the likelihood of CEO turnover. This relation is not associated with governance structure. It also is not sig- nificantly different in stock versus cash acquisitions, which appears to be inconsistent with Shleifer and Vishny’s theory of “stock market driven” acquisitions. This Paper Examines Whether Chief Executive Officer(ceo) turnover is related to the amount of value CEOs create or destroy through mergers and acquisitions. Mitchell and Lehn (1990) show that in the 1980s, the market for corporate con- trol disciplined managers who made value-destroying acquisitions. However, little is known about whether internal governance mechanisms have been ef- fective in providing this discipline or whether the takeover market continued to provide this discipline in the 1990s. While this issue is important in its own right, it is of particular interest in light of the decline in hostile takeover ac- tivity in recent years (Holmstrom and Kaplan (2001), Andrade, Mitchell, and Stafford (2001)).

    "abstract": "This paper shows that CEOs are ﬁred after bad ﬁrm performance caused by factors beyond their control. Standard economic theory predicts that corporate boards ﬁlter out exogenous industry and market shocks from ﬁrm performance before deciding on CEO retention. Using a hand-collected sample of 3,365 CEO turnovers from 1993 to 2009, we document that CEOs are signiﬁcantly more likely to be dismissed from their jobs after bad industry and, to a lesser extent, after bad market performance. A decline in industry performance from the 90th to the 10th percentile doubles the probability of a forced CEO turnover. Whether TO Retain OR Fire A CEO after bad stock price or accounting per- formance is one of the most important decisions made by corporate boards. Standard economic theory suggests that, when assessing the quality of its CEO, the board of directors should ignore components of ﬁrm performance that are caused by factors beyond the CEO’s control. Previous studies of the relation between (arguably exogenous) market or industry performance and CEO turnover ﬁnd evidence that is largely consistent with this hypothesis. However, using a larger data set that covers a more recent time period and a better methodology, we ﬁnd that CEOs are signiﬁcantly more likely to be ﬁred after negative performance shocks to their peer group. Speciﬁcally, using a new data set of 2,490 voluntary and 875 forced CEO turnovers in 3,042 ﬁrms from 1993 to 2009, we document that low industry stock returns and",

    "title": "CEOs’ Outside Employment Opportunities",
    "abstract": "Although agency theory suggests that firms should index executive compensation to remove market-wide effects (i.e., RPE), there is little evidence to support this theory. Oyer (2004,Journal of Finance 59, 1619–1649) posits that an absence of RPE is optimal if the CEO’s reservation wages from outside employment opportunities vary with the economy’s fortunes. We directly test and find support for Oyer’s (2004) theory. We argue that the CEO’s outside opportunities depend on his talent, as prox- ied by the CEO’s financial press visibility and his firm’s industry-adjusted ROA. Our results are robust to alternate explanations such as managerial skimming, oligopoly, and asymmetric benchmarking. Agency Theory Predicts That THE Market -wide Component of a firm’s returns should be removed from the compensation package since executives cannot affect the overall market by their actions and it is costly for an executive to bear the relative risks. Such market indexing of compensation is also referred to as relative performance evaluation (RPE).

    "abstract": "We study the performance of collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) to understand the market imperfections giving rise to these vehicles and their corresponding economic costs. CLO equity tranches earn positive abnormal returns from the risk-adjusted price differential between leveraged loans and CLO debt tranches. Debt tranches of- fer higher returns than similarly rated corporate bonds, making them attractive to banks and insurers that face risk-based capital requirements. Temporal variation in equity performance highlights the resilience of CLOs to market volatility due to their closed-end structure, long-term funding, and embedded options to reinvest princi- pal proceeds. Collateralized Loan Obligations (clos) Have Received a great deal of attention in recent years because of their rapid growth and broad reach. Standard & Poor’s ( 2020b) reports that two-thirds, or $2.1 trillion, of lever- aged loan issuance since the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis has been funded by CLOs. A broad array of ﬁnancial institutions invest in CLOs, including banks, insurers, drafting of this paper.

    "abstract": "Self-dealing is potentially important but difﬁcult to measure. In this paper, I study special servicers in commercial mortgage-backed securities (cmbs), which sell dis- tressed assets on behalf of bondholders. Around 2010, ownership changes of four major servicers raised concerns that they may direct beneﬁts to new owners’ afﬁli- ates (buyers and service providers). Loans liquidated after ownership changes have greater loss rates than before (8 percentage points (p.p.), $2.3 billion in losses), rela- tive to other (placebo) servicers. Together with a case study that tracks self-dealing purchases, the ﬁndings point to potential steering conﬂicts that could incentivize tunneling through fees to service providers. While Self-dealing HAS Been ALLEGEDto harm investors, it is difﬁcult to mea- sure (Shleifer and Vishny (1997)). The wave of foreclosures of securitized assets has put a spotlight on intermediaries that manage securitized assets on behalf of bondholders. Anecdotal evidence suggests that some intermediaries tunnel private beneﬁts to their afﬁliates at the expense of distant bondholders (Lee (2014)). However, it is challenging to quantify the extent of self-dealing for securitized assets because of the difﬁculty in tracking them after securitiza- tion. Moreover, self-dealing incentives are endogenous by nature and often confounded by omitted variables. The commercial mortgage-backed securities (cmbs) market provides a use- ful context to address the empirical challenges f",

    "title": "Can Brokers Have It All? On the Relation",
    "abstract": "We identify retail brokers that seemingly route orders to maximize order ﬂow pay- ments, by selling market orders and sending limit orders to venues paying large liquidity rebates. Angel, Harris, and Spatt argue that such routing may not always be in customers’ best interests. For both proprietary limit order data and a broad sample of trades from TAQ, we document a negative relation between several mea- sures of limit order execution quality and rebate/fee level. This ﬁnding suggests that order routing designed to maximize liquidity rebates does not maximize limit order execution quality and thus brokers cannot have it all. Today, Every U.S. Stock exchange levies fees or pays rebates that depend on an order’s attributes. In the standard model, exchanges charge liquidity- demanding orders (i.e., marketable orders) a “take fee” that exceeds the “make rebate” they offer liquidity-supplying orders (i.e., nonmarketable limit orders). More recently, a few exchanges began using inverted fee schedules, charging liquidity suppliers a fee that exceeds the rebate they pay to liquidity deman- ders.1 In this paper, we examine the impact of these differential fee schedules on broker routing decisions and limit order execution quality.

    "abstract": "We study whether R&D-intensive ﬁrms are more resilient to trade shocks. We correct for the endogeneity of R&D using tax-induced changes to R&D costs. While rising imports from China lead to slower sales growth and lower proﬁtability, these effects are signiﬁcantly smaller for ﬁrms with a larger stock of R&D (about half when moving from the bottom quartile to the top quartile of R&D). We provide evidence that this effect is explained by R&D allowing ﬁrms to increase product differentiation. As a result, while ﬁrms in import-competing industries cut capital expenditures and employment, R&D-intensive ﬁrms downsize considerably less. THE Rise OF China, Triggered BY ITS transition to a market-oriented economy and rapid integration into world trade, has been identiﬁed as a major source of disruption for high-income economies, igniting the long-standing debate re- garding the effect of trade with low-wage countries on ﬁrms and workers in the United States and Europe and regarding which ﬁrms are better able to absorb these stocks. In this context, innovation is often viewed as an effective shield against low-cost foreign competition by allowing ﬁrms to climb the quality lad- der and differentiate their products from low-wage countries’ exports. Because wage differences are so large, so the argument goes, competing on costs is bound to fail. Only ﬁrms that have invested in R&D and upgraded product quality are able to compete successfully against low-cost imports (e.g., Leamer (2007)).",

    "abstract": "We document that purchasing (selling short) stocks with the most (least) favorable consensus recommendations, in conjunction with daily portfolio rebalancing and a timely response to recommendation changes, yield annual abnormal gross returns greater than four percent. Less frequent portfolio rebalancing or a delay in react- ing to recommendation changes diminishes these returns; however, they remain significant for the least favorably rated stocks. We also show that high trading levels are required to capture the excess returns generated by the strategies ana- lyzed, entailing substantial transactions costs and leading to abnormal net returns for these strategies that are not reliably greater than zero. This Study Examines Whether Investors can profit from the publicly available recommendations of security analysts. Academic theory and Wall Street practice are clearly at odds regarding this issue. On the one hand, the semi- strong form of market efficiency posits that investors should not be able to trade profitably on the basis of publicly available information, such as ana- age houses spend large sums of money on security analysis, presumably because these firms and their clients believe its use can generate superior returns.

    "title": "Can Managers Forecast Aggregate",
    "abstract": "Previous studies have found that the proportion of equity in total new debt and equity issues is negatively correlated with future equity market returns. Researchers have interpreted this finding as evidence that corporate managers are able to predict the systematic component of their stock returns and to issue equity when the market is overvalued. In this article we show that the predictive power of the share of equity in total new issues stems from pseudo-market timing and not from any abnormal ability of managers to time the equity markets. A Controversial AND Important Issue among financial economists is whether corporate managers accurately time the market when they issue new securities. At the firm level, researchers typically address this question by examining the long-run performance of stocks following equity issues. Although there is empirical evidence supporting the idea that managers are able to sell overpriced securities during initial public offerings (IPOs) and seasoned equity offerings (SEOs) (see Ritter (1991), Loughran and Ritter (1995), and Spiess and Affleck- Graves (1995)), several recent studies challenge these results. Adding to this controversy, a recent article by Baker and Wurgler (2000) finds evidence that managers can time not only the idiosyncratic component of their returns but also the systematic component. Specifically, these authors find that, in-sample, the share of equity in total new issues (equity share) is strongly negatively correlated w",

    "title": "Can Managers Successfully Time the Maturity",
    "abstract": "This paper provides a rational explanation for the apparent ability of managers to suc- cessfully time the maturity of their debt issues. We show that a structural break in excess bond returns during the early 1980s generates a spurious correlation between the fraction of long-term debt in total debt issues and future excess bond returns. Con- trary to Baker, Taliaferro, and Wurgler (2006), we show that the presence of structural breaks can lead to nonsense regressions, whether or not there is any small sample bias. Tests using firm-level data further confirm that managers are unable to time the debt market successfully. AN Important Implication OF THE Efficient Markets Hypothesis is that corporate managers cannot, on average, successfully predict future market returns. While issue long-term debt when they believe that future long-term bond returns will be low, they cannot do so with any systematic success when capital mar- kets are complete and efficient. However, a number of recent studies argue that such forward-looking timing efforts may in fact correctly anticipate future mar- ket returns and lead firms to a lower cost of capital through successful market timing (see, for example, Ritter (1991), Loughran and Ritter (1995), Spiess and Affleck-Graves (1995), and Baker and Wurgler (2000)). Although most of the existing studies examine the ability of managers to time equity issues, recent evidence suggests that managers also time the maturity of their debt issues. For instan",

    "abstract": "We apply a new bootstrap statistical technique to examine the performance of the U.S. Open-end, domestic equity mutual fund industry over the 1975 to 2002 period. A bootstrap approach is necessary because the cross section of mutual fund alphas has a complex nonnormal distribution due to heterogeneous risk-taking by funds as well as nonnormalities in individual fund alpha distributions. Our bootstrap approach uncovers findings that differ from many past studies. Specifically, we find that a sizable minority of managers pick stocks well enough to more than cover their costs. Moreover, the superior alphas of these managers persist. WAS Peter Lynch, Former Manager of the Fidelity Magellan fund, a “star” stock- picker, or was he simply endowed with stellar luck? The popular press seems to assume that Mr. Lynch’s fund performed well due to his unusual acumen in identifying underpriced stocks. In addition, Marcus (1990) concludes that the prolonged superior performance of the Magellan fund is difficult to explain as a purely random outcome, that is, where Mr. Lynch and the other Magellan man- agers have no true stockpicking skills and are merely the luckiest of a large group of fund managers. More recently, the Schroder Ultra Fund topped the field of 6,000 funds (across all investment objective categories) with a return of 107% per year over the 3 years ending in 2001.

    "abstract": "How will banks evolve as competition increases from other banks and from the capital market? Will banks become more like capital market underwriters and offer passive transaction loans or return to their roots as relationship lending ex- perts? These are the questions we address. Our key result is that as interbank competition increases, banks inake more relationship loans, but each has lower added value for borrowers. Capital market competition reduces relationship lend- ing (and bank lending shrinks), but each relationship loan has greater added value for borrowers. In both cases, welfare increases for some borrowers but not neces- sarily for all. Rapid Changes IN Financial Services ARE threatening commercial banks. In the United States, mutual funds such as Fidelity and Merrill Lynch compete for banks' core deposits. Investment banks, armed with a variety of financial market innovations, challenge banks' traditional lending products. Banks also find themselves in greater competition with one another as globaliza- tion and deregulation weaken geographic boundaries and encourage cross- border (Europe) and interstate (U.S.) banking. These developments raise numerous fundamental questions. Will the relationship-oriented European bank system survive competitive pressures in this changing environment?

    "abstract": "For years, online retailers have maintained a price advantage over brick-and-mortar retailers by not collecting sales tax at the time of sale. Recently, several states have required that online retailer Amazon collect sales tax during checkout. Using transaction-level data, we document that households living in these states reduced their Amazon purchases by 9.4% following the implementation of the sales tax laws, implying elasticities of –1.2 to –1.4. The effect is stronger for large purchases, where purchases declined by 29.1%, corresponding to an elasticity of –3.9. Studying competi- tors in the electronics ﬁeld, we ﬁnd some evidence of substitution toward competing retailers. Over THE Past Decade , Online Retail transactions have increased dramatically in volume. According to the U.S. Census, online sales constituted 3.4% of retail sales in 2007 and 8.9% of retail sales in 2017, corresponding to $453 billion in online sales in 2017. 1 Many factors have contributed to the growth in online sales, one of which is that out-of-state online retailers generally do not charge sales tax, which has given them a price advantage over retailers with a pres- ence in the state. This sales tax collection loophole has not gone unnoticed by state governments or competing retailers.

    "title": "Can Time-Varying Risk of Rare Disasters Explain",
    "abstract": "Why is the equity premium so high, and why are stocks so volatile? Why are stock returns in excess of government bill rates predictable? This paper proposes an answer to these questions based on a time-varying probability of a consumption disaster. In the model, aggregate consumption follows a normal distribution with low volatility most of the time, but with some probability of a consumption realization far out in the left tail. The possibility of this poor outcome substantially increases the equity premium, while time-variation in the probability of this outcome drives high stock market volatility and excess return predictability. THE Magnitude OF THEexpected excess return on stocks relative to bonds (the equity premium) constitutes one of the major puzzles in ﬁnancial economics. As Mehra and Prescott (1985) show, the ﬂuctuations observed in the consumption growth rate over U.S. History predict an equity premium that is far too small, assuming reasonable levels of risk aversion.1 One proposed explanation is that the return on equities is high to compensate investors for the risk of a rare disaster (Rietz (1988)). An open question has therefore been whether the risk is sufﬁciently high, and the rare disaster sufﬁciently severe, to quantitatively explain the equity premium. Recently, however, Barro (2006) shows that it is possible to explain the equity premium using such a model when the probability of a rare disaster is calibrated to international data on large economic decl",

    "abstract": "We hypothesize that investors partially think about stock price changes in dollar rather than percentage units, leading to more extreme return responses to news for lower-priced stocks. Consistent with such non-proportional thinking, we ﬁnd a dou- bling in price is associated with a 20% to 30% decline in volatility and beta (con- trolling for size/liquidity). To identify a causal price effect, we show that volatility jumps following stock splits and drops following reverse splits. Lower-priced stocks also respond more strongly to ﬁrm-speciﬁc news. Non-proportional thinking helps explain asset pricing patterns such as the size-volatility/beta relation, the leverage effect puzzle, and return drift and reversals. When Evaluating HOW A Piece of news should affect stock prices, rational investors should think in percentage terms rather than nominal dollar terms.

    "abstract": "We study the effects of capital account liberalization on ﬁrm capital allocation and ag- gregate productivity in 10 Eastern European countries. Using a large ﬁrm-level data set, we show that capital account liberalization decreases the dispersion in the return to capital across ﬁrms, particularly in sectors more dependent on external ﬁnance. We provide evidence that capital account liberalization improves capital allocation by allowing ﬁnancially constrained ﬁrms to demand more capital and produce at a more efﬁcient level. Finally, using a model of misallocation we document that capital account liberalization increases aggregate productivity through more efﬁcient capital allocation by 10% to 16%. IN THE Last Three Decades, Many developing countries have opened their cap- ital accounts, lifting legal restrictions imposed on international capital trans- actions. There is a growing consensus that capital account liberalization leads to higher economic growth (Quinn and Toyoda (2008)). Higher growth can be the result of factor accumulation or higher productivity. Recent cross-country studies show that ﬁnancial openness affects growth primarily through higher productivity (Bonﬁglioli (2008), Bekaert, Harvey, and Lundblad (2011)).

    "title": "Capital Budgeting versus Market Timing:",
    "abstract": "Using demand shifts induced by demographics, we evaluate capital budgeting and market timing. Capital budgeting implies that industries anticipating positive de- mand shifts in the near future should issue more equity to ﬁnance greater capacity. To the extent that demand shifts in the distant future are not incorporated into eq- uity prices, market timing implies that industries anticipating positive shifts in the distant future should issue less equity due to undervaluation. The evidence supports both theories: new listings and equity issuance respond positively to demand shifts during the next 5 years and negatively to demand shifts further in the future. THE Determinants OF EQUITYissuance are the subject of an ongoing debate in corporate ﬁnance. Are initial public offerings (IPOs) and seasoned offerings best explained by the demands for external ﬁnance, or are they driven by market timing in response to company misvaluation? Capital budgeting holds that ﬁrms issue equity (and debt) to invest the pro- ceeds in positive net present value (NPV) projects, for example, to expand production when demand is high (Modigliani and Miller (1958)). Market tim- ing instead holds that ﬁrms issue equity to take advantage of mispricing by investors (Stein (1996),Baker, Ruback, and Wurgler (2007)). One crucial difﬁculty in evaluating these theories is the lack of exogenous proxies for investment opportunities, on the one hand, and for misvaluation, on the other hand. For instance, the relat",

    "abstract": "Twelve trillion dollars are allocated to private market funds that require outside investors to commit to transferring capital on demand. We show within a novel dynamic portfolio allocation model that ex-ante commitment has large effects on investors’ portfolios and welfare, and we quantify those effects. Investors are under- allocated to private market funds and are willing to pay a larger premium to adjust the quantity committed than to eliminate other frictions, like timing uncertainty and limited tradability. Perhaps counterintuitively, commitment risk premiums increase with secondary market liquidity, and they do not disappear when investments are spread over many funds. Institutional Investors ’exposure TO Private market funds amounts to over $12 trillion. 1 These funds span a wide range of investments from real estate to leveraged buyouts, private debt, and venture capital. A deﬁning fea- ture of private market funds, irrespective of their focus, is that they require investors to commit capital to fund managers before it is used (“called”), and anonymous referee for their guidance.

    "abstract": "We study trading costs and dealer behavior in U.S. Corporate bond markets from 2006 to 2016. Despite a temporary spike during the ﬁnancial crisis, average trade execution costs have not increased notably over time. However, dealer capital commitment, turnover, block trade frequency, and average trade size decreased during the ﬁnancial crisis and thereafter. These declines are attributable to bank-afﬁliated dealers, as nonbank dealers have increased their market commitment. Our evidence indicates that liquidity provision in the corporate bond markets is evolving away from the commitment of bank-afﬁliated dealer capital to absorb customer imbalances, and that postcrisis banking regulations likely contribute. THE Liquidity OF THE CORPORATEbond market has attracted substantial atten- tion from practitioners, regulators, and academics in recent years. The ﬁnancial crisis of 2007 to 2009 saw the broad deterioration of liquidity in both equity (e.g., Anand, Irvine, Puckett, and Venkataraman (2013)) and corporate bond Star Conference, Notre Dame 2016 Conference on Current Topics in Financial Regulation, 2016 and comments.

    "title": "Capital Gains Tax Overhang and Price Pressure",
    "abstract": "I study whether the capital gains tax is an impediment to selling by some investors and if so, to what degree associated delayed selling affects stock prices. I find that sell- ing decisions by institutions serving tax-sensitive clients are sensitive to cumulative capital gains, a pattern not observed for institutions with predominantly tax-exempt clients. Moreover, tax-related underselling impacts stock prices during large earnings surprises for stocks held primarily by tax-sensitive investors. The corresponding price reactions are less negative (more positive) with higher cumulative capital gains. This price pressure pattern is more severe when arbitrage is more costly. When Investors Sell Stock AT A Profit they realize capital gains and pay related taxes that they could otherwise defer indefinitely if they chose instead not to sell. The capital gains tax poses a cost of selling that can be an order of magnitude greater than the conventional transaction costs such as commissions and bid–ask spreads. In general, a considerable literature provides evidence that barriers to trading affect the willingness of investors to trade and, in turn, asset prices. Here, I investigate whether the capital gains tax is, in fact, an impediment to selling and, if it is, to what degree stock prices are affected by investors’ delayed selling. The first half of the paper explores whether institutions that serve tax- sensitive clients are sensitive to those clients’ cumulative capital gains when",

    "abstract": "This paper demonstrates that the equilibrium impact of capital gains taxes reflects both the capitalization effect (i.e., capital gains taxes decrease demand) and the lock-in effect (i.e., capital gains taxes decrease supply). Depending on time periods and stock characteristics, either effect may dominate. Using the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 as our event, we find evidence supporting a dominant capitalization effect in the week following news that sharply increased the probability of a reduction in the capital gains tax rate and a dominant lock-in effect in the week after the rate reduction became effective. This Paper Jointly Tests two effects of capital gains taxation on equity trading: a demand-side capitalization effect and a supply-side lock-in effect. While pre- vious studies have tested these effects separately, to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to evaluate them jointly and empirically document the relative dominance of each effect surrounding a change in a tax rate. Employing an equilibrium approach, we show that these effects’ net tax impact on asset prices is ambiguous. Evaluating returns and trading volume around the 1997 reduction in the capital gains tax rate, we find evidence that the capitalization and the lock-in effects jointly affect trading. In particular, the capitalization effect dominates the lock-in effect in the week following an increase in the probability of a reduction in the capital gains tax rate, as buyers respond to informati",

    "abstract": "One explanation for the negative relationship between short-horizon stock re- turns and inflation is that inflation proxies (inversely) for expected future real output. In this paper, I examine the possibility that inflation also proxies for variation in real price/dividend ratios (excess returns). I show that when the covariance between real price/dividend ratios and inflation is nonzero, the re- lationship between returns and expected inflation differs for the two compo- nents of returns: dividend yields and capital gains returns. My empirical evidence demonstrates that dividend yields and capital gains are related dif- ferently to expected inflation in U.S. And foreign markets. Prior Studies Find that short-horizon stock returns are negatively related to both anticipated and unanticipated inflation in post-1953 data.1 These studies focus on the relationship between total returns and inflation for aggregate stock mar- ket and industry portfolios. I extend the literature by examining the relation- ships between expected inflation and the two components of stock returns: dividend yields and capital gains returns. I interpret my results in the context of Fama's (1981) \"proxy hypothesis\" Fama (1981) proposes that inflation proxies for real activity.

The traditional real op- tions view is that ﬁrms undertake capital investment to conve rt growth options into assets-in- place (AIP), with an attendant negative relation between cap ital investment and subsequent short-run expected returns (e.g., Berk, Green, and Naik (BGN, 1 999), Carlson, Fisher, and Giammarino (CFG, 2006)). This view is an apt description of te chnologically mature in- dustries. However, in many industries with rich possibilities for innovation, ﬁrms undertake capital investment to develop innovative capacity (IC) to ge nerate and commercialize po- tential future innovations (see Furman, Porter, and Stern (2 002)). For example, setting up long-range research facilities and acquiring patents can he lp generate growth options because innovation-related activities are often sources of new idea s and opportunities (Schumpeter (1942) and Maclaurin (1953)). In this paper, we model unique features of IC investment and em pirically test refutable predictions on the dynamic eﬀects of IC investment on future st ock returns, investment, and proﬁtability. Distinct from traditional option-exercising investment, IC investment helps develop innovations (or new growth options), but with signiﬁc ant uncertainty in their gen- eration and exercise given the nature of the innovation discov ery and commercial",

    "title": "Capital Share Dynamics When Firms",
    "abstract": "Although the aggregate capital share of U.S. ﬁrms has increased, capital share at the ﬁrm-level has decreased. This divergence is due to mega-ﬁrms that produce a larger output share without a proportionate increase in labor compensation. We develop a model in which ﬁrms insure workers against ﬁrm-speciﬁc shocks, with more productive ﬁrms allocating more rents to shareholders, while less productive ﬁrms endogenously exit. Increasing ﬁrm-level risk delays exit and increases the mea- sure of mega-ﬁrms, raising (lowering) the aggregate (average) capital share. An in- crease in the level of rents magniﬁes this effect. We present evidence that supports this mechanism. Over THE Last Several Decades, publicly traded U.S. ﬁrms have experienced large increases in the ﬁrm-speciﬁc volatility of both ﬁrm-level cash ﬂows and returns (see, for example, Campbell et al. (2001), Comin and Philippon (2005), Xiaolan (2014), Bloom (2014), and Herskovic et al. (2016)). At the same time, the share of total value added (VA) that accrues to the owners of these ﬁrms (i.e., the aggregate capital share) has also increased (see, for example, Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014) and Piketty and Zucman (2014)).

    "abstract": "Using a data set of East Asian nonfinancial companies, we examine a firm's choice between local, foreign, and synthetic local currency (hedged foreign currency) debt. We find evidence of unique as well as common factors that de- termine each debt type's use, indicating the importance of examining debt at a disaggregated level. We exploit the Asian financial crisis as a natural experi- ment to investigate the role of debt type in firm performance. Surprisingly, we find that the use of synthetic local currency debt is associated with the biggest drop in market value, possibly due to currency derivative market illiquidity during the crisis. Capital markets, both debt and equity, are becoming more global. For example, in 2000, 434 foreign companies from 51 different countries had listed shares on the New York Stock Exchange. This compares to only 60 foreign listings from a dozen and cross-listing by non-U. S.

    "abstract": "I analyze the strategic use of debt ﬁnancing to improve a ﬁrm’s bargaining position with an important supplier—organized labor. Because maintaining high levels of cor- porate liquidity can encourage workers to raise their wage demands, a ﬁrm with external ﬁnance constraints has an incentive to use the cash ﬂow demands of debt service to improve its bargaining position with workers. Using both ﬁrm-level collec- tive bargaining coverage and state changes in labor laws to identify changes in union bargaining power, I show that strategic incentives from union bargaining appear to have a substantial impact on corporate ﬁnancing decisions.

    "abstract": "This study uses a new data set to assess whether capital structure theory is por- table across countries with different institutional structures. We analyze capital structure choices of firms in 10 developing countries, and provide evidence that these decisions are affected by the same variables as in developed countries. How- ever, there are persistent differences across countries, indicating that specific coun- try factors are at work. Our findings suggest that although some of the insights from modern finance theory are portable across countries, much remains to be done to understand the impact of different institutional features on capital struc- ture choices. OUR Knowledge OF Capital Structures has mostly been derived from data from developed economies that have many institutional similarities. The pur- pose of this paper is to analyze the capital structure choices made by com- panies from developing countries that have different institutional structures. The prevailing view, for example Mayer ~1990!, seems to be that financial decisions in developing countries are somehow different. Mayer is the most recent researcher to use aggregate flow of funds data to differentiate be- tween financial systems based on the “Anglo-Saxon” capital markets model and those based on a “Continental-German-Japanese” banking model.

    "abstract": "We document how a positive shock to investment opportunities at one plant (“treated plant”) spills over to other plants within the same ﬁrm, but only if the ﬁrm is ﬁ- nancially constrained. To provide the treated plant with resources, the ﬁrm’s head- quarters withdraws capital and labor from other plants, especially plants that are relatively less productive, not part of the ﬁrm’s core industries, and located far away from headquarters. As a result of the resource reallocation, aggregate ﬁrm-wide pro- ductivity increases. We do not ﬁnd evidence of capital or labor spillovers among plants of ﬁnancially unconstrained ﬁrms. The “efﬁcient internal capital markets hypothesis” postulates that corporate headquarters, by virtue of its control rights, can create value by actively re- allocating scarce resources across projects (see, for example, Alchian ( 1969), Williamson ( 1975), Stein ( 1997)). By contrast, an external lender, such as a bank, does not possess the authority to reallocate scarce resources across borrowers. This fundamental idea—that headquarters can create value by actively re- allocating scarce resources—is testable.

    "abstract": "The pricing of carbon transition risk is central to the debate on climate-aware invest- ments. Emissions are tightly linked to sales and are available to investors only with signiﬁcant lags. The positive carbon return, or brown-minus-green return differen- tial, documented in previous studies arises from forward-looking ﬁrm performance information contained in emissions rather than a risk premium in ex ante expected returns. After accounting for the data release lag, carbon returns turn negative in the United States and insigniﬁcant globally. Developed markets experience lower carbon returns due to intense climate concern shocks, while countries with stringent climate policies exhibit higher carbon returns. The pricing of carbon transition risk is a central question as investors consider climate-aware investments. Theoretically, brown ﬁrms are more exposed to policy risk during the transition to net zero and should earn higher expected returns in equilibrium (Hsu, Li, and Tsou, 2023). Green ﬁrms, however, can outperform when policy shocks kick in, consumer attention turns, and investor tastes shift in transition to net-zero (Pastor, Stambaugh, and Taylor, 2021).

Furthermore, we show that volatility risk dominates liquidity risk and our volatility risk proxy also performs well for pricing returns of other portfolios. This Paper Studies THE risk-return proﬁle of a popular trading strategy that borrows in currencies with low interest rates and invests in currencies with high interest rates. This trading strategy is called “carry trade.” According to uncovered interest parity (UIP), if investors are risk neutral and form expecta- tions rationally, exchange rate changes will eliminate any gain arising from the differential in interest rates across countries.

    "abstract": "We develop a new approach to modeling dynamics in cash ﬂows extracted from daily ﬁrm-level dividend announcements. We decompose daily cash ﬂow news into a persis- tent component, jumps, and temporary shocks. Empirically, we ﬁnd that the persistent cash ﬂow component is a highly signiﬁcant predictor of future growth in dividends and consumption. Using a log-linearized present value model, we show that news about the persistent dividend growth component predicts stock returns consistent with asset pricing constraints implied by this model. News about the daily dividend growth process also helps explain concurrent return volatility and the probability of jumps in stock returns. ONM O S TD A Y S, A MULTITUDEof ﬁrms announces cash ﬂow news, but the number of ﬁrms, as well as the industries they belong to, can vary greatly over time. Such variation gives rise to a highly irregular cash ﬂow news process, which complicates investors’ attempt to infer the underlying growth rate of cash ﬂows for individual ﬁrms, industries, and the economy as a whole. This is important because cash ﬂow news is a key determinant of investors’ forecasts of future cash ﬂows and of their risks, and hence ultimately of how stocks are priced.1 sociate Editor, and two anonymous referees for many valuable suggestions on our paper.

    "title": "Cash Flow, Consumption Risk, and the",
    "abstract": "I link an asset’s risk premium to two characteristics of its underlying cash flow: covari- ance and duration. Using empirically novel estimates of both cash flow characteristics based exclusively on accounting earnings and aggregate consumption data, I examine their dynamic interaction in a two-factor cash flow model and find that they are able to explain up to 82% of the cross-sectional variation in the average returns on size, book-to-market, and long-term reversal-sorted portfolios for the period 1964 to 2002. This finding highlights the importance of fundamental cash flow characteristics in determining the risk exposure of an asset. Differences IN Expected Return Across assets are determined by differences in the assets’ exposure to systematic risk. This key insight in financial economics is reflected in the standard consumption-based asset pricing model (ccapm, see Rubinstein (1976), Lucas (1978), and Breeden (1979)). Ccapm predicts that an asset’s consumption beta—a measure of the comovement between asset re- turn and aggregate consumption—determines its expected return. Yet despite its intuitive appeal, many early empirical tests have not supported this pre- diction (see Breeden, Gibbons, and Litzenberger (1989)). Beginning with the seminal work of Bansal and Yaron (2004), advances in our understanding of “long-run” consumption risk may validate this theoretical position after all. Indeed, papers such as Parker and Julliard (2005), Bansal, Dittmar, and Lund- blad (2005",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the relation between corporate liquidity and diversiﬁcation. The key ﬁnding is that multidivision ﬁrms hold signiﬁcantly less cash than stand-alone ﬁrms because they are diversiﬁed in their investment opportunities. Lower cross- divisional correlations in investment opportunity and higher correlations between investment opportunity and cash ﬂow correspond to lower cash holdings, even after controlling for cash ﬂow volatility. The effects are strongest in ﬁnancially constrained ﬁrms and in well-governed ﬁrms, and correspond to efﬁcient fund transfers from low- to high-productivity divisions. Taken together, these results bring forth an efﬁcient link between diversiﬁcation and corporate liquidity. Cash Holdings OF U.S. Companies are enormous and growing over time. As of ﬁscal year 2006, nonﬁnancial and nonutility ﬁrms in the Compustat universe reported aggregate cash holdings of over 1.7 trillion dollars, representing 9.2% of the total market value of these ﬁrms’ equity.1 The growth in cash holdings is equally impressive. According to Bates, Kahle, and Stulz (2009, BKS hence- forth), listed U.S. Industrial ﬁrms’ average ratio of cash to assets increased from 10.5% in 1980 to 23.2% in 2006.

    "title": "Cash and Corporate Control",
    "abstract": "The takeover market is often suggested as appropriate for containing the agency problems of excessive corporate cash holdings. However, recent studies report con- tradictory evidence. I focus on the takeover-deterrence effects of corporate liquidity and suggest the proxy contest as an effective alternative control mechanism. I find that proxy fight targets hold 23% more cash than comparable firms, and that the probability of a contest is significantly increasing in excess cash holdings. Proxy fight announcement return also is positively related to excess cash. Following a contest, ex- ecutive turnover and special cash distributions to shareholders increase, while cash holdings significantly decline. Quite Often, THE Takeover Market is suggested as ideal for containing the agency problems of corporate free cash flow. Contrary to this, however, Harford (1999) and Pinkowitz (2002) both find that the likelihood of a firm becoming a takeover target is significantly negatively related to the holding of excess cash. This result could be explained in terms of the takeover-deterrence effects of corporate liquidity. Excess cash enhances the ability of a hostile target to defend itself against an unwanted bid. Such defenses include repurchasing stock, acquiring a competitor of the bidder and filing private antitrust litigation, or turning around to acquire the suitor itself (Bagwell (1991), Stulz (1988), and Dann and DeAngelo (1988)). In addition, excess cash increases the bidder’s unce",

    "abstract": "We provide a model of the effects of catastrophic risk on real estate financing and prices and demonstrate that insurance market imperfections can restrict the supply of credit for catastrophe-susceptible properties. Using unique micro-level data, we find that earthquake risk decreased commercial real estate bank loan provision by 22% in California properties in the 1990s, with more severe effects in African–American neighborhoods. We show that the 1994 Northridge earthquake had only a short-term disruptive effect. Our basic findings are confirmed for hurricane risk, and our model and empirical work have implications for terrorism and political perils. Catastrophic Events CAN DRAMATICALLYaffect the well-being of people throughout entire regions. Episodes such as September 11, 2001, the December 26, 2004 tsunami in Asia, and Hurricane Katrina in August 2005 highlight the risks borne by individuals, particularly those with limited financial resources. Fi- nancial markets can help to manage these risks by playing two crucial roles. First, markets provide a mechanism through which risk is allocated efficiently. Second, financial markets can serve as a stable source of funding during post- catastrophe periods. Little is known, however, about how well financial markets perform these functions. In this paper, we provide a model of the effects of catas- trophe risk on the financing and pricing of properties and find corroborating evidence for the model using unique micro-level data o",

    "title": "Catering through Nominal Share Prices",
    "abstract": "We propose and test a catering theory of nominal stock prices. The theory predicts that when investors place higher valuations on low-price firms, managers respond by supplying shares at lower price levels, and vice versa. We confirm these predictions in time-series and firm-level data using several measures of time-varying catering incentives. More generally, the results provide unusually clean evidence that catering influences corporate decisions, because the process of targeting nominal share prices is not well explained by alternative theories. IN Frictionless AND Efficient stock markets, there is no optimal nominal (per- share) stock price. A firm’s board of directors may choose to split to manage the nominal share price and number of shares outstanding but cannot change its overall market value through these means. Yet boards typically do manage their firms’ nominal share price, rather than watch it passively drift with re- turns. Theories offered to explain share price management include arguments that trading costs depend on nominal prices (Dolley (1933), Angel (1997)), that splits signal inside information (Brennan and Copeland (1988), Asquith, Healy, and Palepu (1989), and Ikenberry, Rankine, and Stice (1996)), or that prices in certain ranges simply constitute a market norm from which there is little gain to deviating (Rozeff (1998), Weld et al.

    "abstract": "Despite their mediocre mean performance, actively managed mutual funds are dis- tinct from passive funds in their return distributions. Active value funds better hedge downside risk, while active growth funds better capture upside potential. Since such performance features may appeal to investors with tail-overweighting preferences, we show that preferences for downside protection and upside potential estimated from the empirical pricing kernel can help explain active fund ﬂows in the value and growth categories, respectively. This effect of investor risk preferences varies sig- niﬁcantly with funds’ downside-hedging and upside-capturing ability, with levels of active management, and across retirement and retail funds. Despite THE Mediocre Performance of actively managed mutual funds rela- tive to their passively managed counterparts, assets under active management continue to signiﬁcantly outweigh those of index funds.1 This puzzle has at- tracted considerable interest in the mutual fund literature. While some stud- ies attempt to rationalize investments in actively managed funds by modeling state-dependent managerial effort or skill, in this paper we explore components in the demand for active management that stem from investor preferences for upside potential or downside risk protection. We show that, compared with pas- sive benchmarks, active value funds achieve greater downside hedging while Ken Singleton (the Editor); the anonymous Associate Editor; two anonymous refere",

    "abstract": "We analyze the reliability of voluntary disclosures of ﬁnancial information, focusing on widely-employed publicly-available hedge fund databases. Tracking changes to statements of historical performance recorded between 2007 and 2011, we ﬁnd that historical returns are routinely revised. These revisions are not merely random or corrections of earlier mistakes; they are partly forecastable by fund characteristics. Funds that revise their performance histories signiﬁcantly and predictably underper- form those that have never revised, suggesting that unreliable disclosures constitute a valuable source of information for investors. These results speak to current debates about mandatory disclosures by ﬁnancial institutions to market regulators. IN January 2011, THE Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposed a rule requiring U.S.-based hedge funds to provide regular reports on their performance, trading positions, and counterparties to a new ﬁnancial stability panel established under the Dodd-Frank Act. A modiﬁed version of this pro- posal was voted for in October 2011, and was phased in starting late 2012. The rule requires detailed quarterly reports (using new Form PF) for 200 or so large hedge funds, those managing over U.S.$1.5 billion, which collectively account for over 80% of total hedge fund assets under management (AUM); for smaller hedge funds, the reports are less detailed, and are required only annually.

    "title": "Changing Names with Style: Mutual Fund Name",
    "abstract": "We examine whether mutual funds change their names to take advantage of current hot investment styles, and what effects these name changes have on inflows to the funds, and to the funds’ subsequent returns. We find that the year after a fund changes its name to reflect a current hot style, the fund experiences an average cumulative abnormal flow of 28%, with no improvement in performance. The increase in flows is similar across funds whose holdings match the style implied by their new name and those whose holdings do not, suggesting that investors are irrationally influenced by cosmetic effects. Mutual Funds Offer A Unique Opportunity to study the behavior of individual investors via the examination of mutual fund flow data. This is important, since investors’ asset allocation decisions across mutual funds may ultimately affect asset returns. For example, Goetzmann, Massa, and Rouwenhorst (2002) document that factors extracted from the covariance matrix of mutual fund flows provide incremental information beyond broad-based asset class returns in explaining returns in the cross-section. In this paper, we provide striking new evidence of seemingly irrational be- havior by mutual fund investors when they allocate assets across mutual funds. We also provide evidence of timing behavior on the part of fund managers who appear to take advantage of the suboptimal behavior of investors. Specifically, we analyze fund flow patterns around conditional name changes in the mutual fund ind",

    "title": "Characteristics of Risk and Return",
    "abstract": "This paper analyzes 4,750 mergers from 1963 to 1998 to characterize the risk and return in risk arbitrage. Results indicate that risk arbitrage returns are positively correlated with market returns in severely depreciating markets but uncorrelated with market returns in flat and appreciating markets. This suggests that returns to risk arbitrage are similar to those obtained from selling uncovered index put options. Using a contingent claims analysis that controls for the nonlinear rela- tionship with market returns, and after controlling for transaction costs, we find that risk arbitrage generates excess returns of four percent per year. After THE Announcement OF A Merger or acquisition, the target company’s stock typically trades at a discount to the price offered by the acquiring company. The difference between the target’s stock price and the offer price is known as the arbitrage spread. Risk arbitrage, also called merger arbi- trage, refers to an investment strategy that attempts to profit from this spread. If the merger is successful, the arbitrageur captures the arbitrage spread. However, if the merger fails, the arbitrageur incurs a loss, usually much greater than the profits obtained if the deal succeeds. In this paper, we provide estimates of the returns to risk arbitrage investments, and we also describe the risks associated with these returns. Risk arbitrage commonly invokes images of extraordinary profits and in- credible implosions. Numerous articles in the popul",

    "abstract": "We study the investment analyses of 67 portfolio investments by 11 venture capital (VC) firms. VCs describe the strengths and risks of the investments as well as expected postinvestment actions. We classify the risks into three categories and relate them to the allocation of cash flow rights, contingencies, control rights, and liquidation rights between VCs and entrepreneurs. The risk results suggest that agency and hold-up problems are important to contract design and monitoring, but that risk sharing is not. Greater VC control is associated with increased management intervention, while greater VC equity incentives are associated with increased value-added support. Most Financial Contracting Theories Address how conflicts between a principal/ investor and an agent/entrepreneur affect ex ante information collection, con- tract design, and ex post monitoring. In this paper, we empirically test the predictions of financial contracting theories using investments by venture cap- italists (VCs) in early stage entrepreneurs—real world entities that arguably closely approximate the principals and agents of theory. VCs face four generic (agency) problems in the investment process. First, the VC is concerned that the entrepreneur will not work hard to maximize value after the investment is made. In such a case, when the entrepreneur’s effort is unobservable to the VC, the traditional moral hazard approach, pioneered by Holmstr¨om (1979), predicts that the VC will make the entrepreneur",

    "abstract": "The provision of subsidized credit to ﬁnancial institutions is an important and fre- quently used policy tool of governments and central banks. To assess its effectiveness, we exploit changes in international bilateral political relationships that generate shocks to the cost of ﬁnancing for microﬁnance institutions (MFIs). MFIs that experi- ence politically driven reductions in total borrowing costs hire more staff and increase administrative expenses. Cheap credit leads to greater proﬁtability for MFIs and pro- motes a shift toward noncommercial loans but has no effect on total overall lending. Instead, the additional resources are either directed to promoting future growth or dissipated. THE Provision OF CREDITto ﬁnancial institutions at below-market interest rates is one of the primary tools used by governments and central banks to regu- late and stimulate the broad economy. When cheap ﬁnancing is provided, the beneﬁts of injecting capital must be balanced against the costs of distorting market incentives for ﬁnancial institutions to operate efﬁciently. Despite the widespread use of low-priced credit, however, empirically analyzing its conse- quences is difﬁcult. The allocation of subsidized ﬁnancing may be endogenously related to countrywide economic conditions or to unobserved characteristics of the ﬁnancial institutions receiving the inﬂux of capital.

    "title": "Choosing to Disagree: Endogenous",
    "abstract": "The psychology literature documents that individuals derive current utility from their beliefs about future events. We show that, as a result, investors in ﬁnancial markets choose to disagree about both private information and price information. When objective price informativeness is low , each investor dismisses the private sig- nals of others and ignores price information. In contrast, when prices are sufﬁciently informative, heterogeneous interpretations arise endogenously: most investors ignore prices, while the rest condition on it. Our analysis demonstrates how observed devi- ations from rational expectations (e.g., dismissiveness, overconﬁdence) arise endoge- nously , interact with each other, and vary with economic conditions. THE Standard Approach IN Economics assumes that market participants have rational expectations and learn efﬁciently from the information in prices. Yet there is ample evidence that people do not behave this way: returns ex- hibit excess predictability and volatility , investors are overconﬁdent and trade too often, and individuals appear to underreact to prices in some settings but overreact in others.1 To explain this evidence, existing literature explores how sity of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.

    "abstract": "This paper analyzes the early exercise of exchange-traded options by different classes of investors over the 1996 to 1999 period. A large number of exercises are identified as clearly irrational without invoking any model of market equi- librium. Customers of discount brokers and customers of full-service brokers both engage in a significant number of irrational exercises while traders at large investment houses exhibit no irrational early exercise behavior. Rational and irrational exercise is triggered for discount and full-service customers by the underlying stock price attaining its highest level over the past year and by high returns on the underlying stock. IT IS Well-known That in the absence of market frictions, it is irrational to exercise American call options early except in some circumstances just before the under- lying stock goes ex-dividend. Even in the presence of market frictions, it is possi- ble to identify-without the imposition of any model of market equilibrium call exercises that are clearly irrational. In this paper, we employ a previously unavailable data set to analyze the rationality of early exercises of Chicago Board Option Exchange (cboe) calls over the 1996 to 1999 period by customers of dis- count brokers (discount customers), customers of full-service brokers (full-ser- vice customers), and traders at large investment houses trading for their firms' own accounts (firm proprietary traders).

What types of securities and trades are best suited for electronic trading? We study these questions by focusing on an innovation in electronic trading technology that enables investors to simultaneously search many bond dealers. We show that periodic one-sided electronic auctions are a viable and important source of liquidity even in inactively traded instruments. These mechanisms are a natural compromise between bilateral search in OTC markets and continuous double auctions in electronic limit order books. Over-the-counter (OTC) markets are characterized by off-exchange, bilateral negotiations with dealers.

    "abstract": "We propose a new measure of private information in decentralized markets— connections—which exploits the time variation in the number of dealers with whom a client trades in a time period. Using trade-level data for the U.K. Government bond market, we show that clients perform better when having more connections as their trades predict future price movements. Time variation in market-wide connections also helps explain yield dynamics. Given our novel measure, we present two appli- cations suggesting that (i) dealers pass on information, acquired from their informed clients, to their afﬁliates, and (ii) informed clients better predict the orderﬂow inter- mediated by their dealers. A Main Role OF Financial markets is to aggregate private information held by economic agents. Trading activity and subsequent adjustments in asset prices release this information to the wider public, thereby making markets more efﬁcient and increasing the welfare of society. The main challenge facing any scientiﬁc study of this mechanism is that neither private information nor the identities of its owners are readily observable. Our paper proposes a proxy for private information.

    "abstract": "I examine the motivation for, and effect of, including a collar in a merger agreement. The most important cross-sectional determinants of the bid structure (cash vs. Stock, and whether to include a collar) are the market-related stock return standard devia- tions for the bidder and target. This evidence supports the hypothesis that the method of payment is dependent on the sensitivities of the bidder and target to market-related risk because either has the incentive to demand renegotiation of the merger terms if the value of the bidder’s offer changes materially relative to the value of the target during the bid period. AN Important Decision Made during merger or takeover negotiations is the method of payment to be offered to target shareholders. Takeover bids can be made in cash and/or some combination of securities issued by the bidding firm. A considerable number of papers in the finance literature provide empir- ical evidence on the determinants of the choice between stock and cash as the method of payment, including Carleton et al.

Collateral value, therefore, creates deviations from the Law of One Price. The spread between collateralizeable and noncollateralizeable assets is signiﬁcant and quantitatively close to theoretical predictions. THE 2008 Financial Crisis Highlighted THE limited understanding of the role of leverage in ﬁnancial markets among both academics and practitioners. 1As a result, in the years following the crisis, a strand of the theoretical ﬁnan- cial literature focused on the impact of leverage on asset prices. 2 During the crisis, it also became apparent that cross-sectional differences in asset prices were related to heterogeneity in asset collateral capacities. Several theoret- ical papers study the cross-sectional implications of collateralized borrowing in a world where agents are heterogeneous and markets are incomplete: for instance, Fostel and Geanakoplos ( 2008) in a collateral general equilibrium model, Garleanu and Pedersen ( 2011) in a Capm model, and Brumm et al.

    "abstract": "We show that institutions that promote ﬁnancial development ease borrowing con- straints by lowering the collateral spread and shifting the composition of acceptable collateral towards ﬁrm-speciﬁc assets. Collateral spread is deﬁned as the difference in collateralization rates between high- and low-risk borrowers. The average collat- eral spread is large but declines rapidly with improvements in ﬁnancial development driven by stronger institutions. We also show that the composition of collateralizable assets shifts towards non-speciﬁc assets (e.g., land) with borrower risk. However, the shift is considerably smaller in developed ﬁnancial markets, enabling risky borrowers to use a larger variety of assets as collateral. THE Demand FOR Collateralizable Assets is the fundamental cost of ﬁnancing in many models of ﬁnancial constraints (e.g., Bernanke and Gertler (1989), Kiyotaki and Moore (1997), and Banerjee and Newman (1993) among others). Most theoretical models postulate that the availability of collateral is a binding constraint on ﬁnancing, and that this constraint binds harder in more under- developed ﬁnancial markets. However, despite this theoretical emphasis, not much is known about the effect of ﬁnancial development on the collateral cost of capital. One of the reasons for a lack of empirical work is data availability. Information on the value and type of collateral offered by a borrower is difﬁcult to obtain in practice. It is even more difﬁcult to get this kind of in",

    "abstract": "Collateral constraints imply that ﬁnancing and risk management are fundamentally linked. The opportunity cost of engaging in risk management and conserving debt capacity to hedge future ﬁnancing needs is forgone current investment, and is higher for more productive and less well-capitalized ﬁrms. More constrained ﬁrms engage in less risk management and may exhaust their debt capacity and abstain from risk management, consistent with empirical evidence and in contrast to received theory. When cash ﬂows are low, such ﬁrms may be unable to seize investment opportunities and be forced to downsize. Consequently, capital may be less productively deployed in downturns. Financing AND Risk Management are fundamentally linked as both involve promises to pay that are limited by collateral constraints. Engaging in risk management and conserving debt capacity have an opportunity cost—current investment is forgone. This cost is higher for more constrained ﬁrms. This in- sight has important implications for the extent of corporate risk management. We provide a dynamic model of collateralized ﬁrm ﬁnancing in which ﬁrms have access to complete markets, subject to collateral constraints due to lim- ited enforcement, and hence are able to engage in risk management. Firms may choose to conserve debt capacity to take advantage of future investment opportunities.

We thus explain why banks are senior lenders and quantify the value of claimant priority. Collateral Reduces THE RISKof debt in two important ways.

    "title": "Collective Risk Management in a Flight",
    "abstract": "Severe flight to quality episodes involve uncertainty about the environment, not only risk about asset payoffs. The uncertainty is triggered by unusual events and untested financial innovations that lead agents to question their worldview. We present a model of crises and central bank policy that incorporates Knightian uncertainty. The model explains crisis regularities such as market-wide capital immobility, agents’ disen- gagement from risk, and liquidity hoarding. We identify a social cost of these behav- iors, and a benefit of a lender of last resort facility. The benefit is particularly high because public and private insurance are complements during uncertainty-driven crises. Policy practitioners operating under a risk-management para- digm may, at times, be led to undertake actions intended to provide in- surance against especially adverse outcomes... When confronted with uncertainty, especially Knightian uncertainty, human beings invariably attempt to disengage from medium to long-term commitments in favor of safety and liquidity... The immediate response on the part of the central bank to such financial implosions must be to inject large quantities of liquidity... ” Alan Greenspan (2004).",

    "abstract": "High commissions in the U.S. Residential real estate agency market pose a puzzle for economic theory because brokerage is not a concentrated industry. We model brokered markets as a game in which agents post prices for customers and then choose which other agents to work with. We show that there exists an equilibrium in which each agent conditions working with other agents on those agents’ posted prices. Prices can therefore be meaningfully higher than the competitive level (for a ﬁxed discount factor), regardless of the number of agents. Thus, brokered markets can remain un- competitive even with low concentration and easy entry. THE Real Estate Industry IN the United States is characterized by widespread price coordination: The brokerage fee is typically 6%, with half of the fee going to the buyer’s agent and half going to the seller’s agent. There is little evidence that the 6% fee represents the true cost of facilitating a real estate transaction as it has been constant for decades (despite substantial changes in the technology used), varies with neither market conditions nor the price of the house being sold, and is appreciably higher than in many other Austin.

We develop a general equilibrium model of international trade and currency pricing where countries have an advantage in producing either basic inputs or ﬁnal goods. In the model, domestic production insulates commodity-producing countries from global productivity shocks, forcing ﬁnal-good producers to absorb them.

    "abstract": "We test the doubly stochastic assumption under which firms’ default times are corre- lated only as implied by the correlation of factors determining their default intensi- ties. Using data on U.S. Corporations from 1979 to 2004, this assumption is violated in the presence of contagion or “frailty” (unobservable explanatory variables that are correlated across firms). Our tests do not depend on the time-series properties of default intensities. The data do not support the joint hypothesis of well-specified default intensities and the doubly stochastic assumption. We find some evidence of default clustering exceeding that implied by the doubly stochastic model with the given intensities. WHY DO Corporate Defaults Cluster IN Time ? Several explanations have been ex- plored. First, firms may be exposed to common or correlated risk factors whose co-movements cause correlated changes in conditional default probabilities. Second, the event of default by one firm may be “contagious,” in that one such event may directly induce other corporate failures, as with the collapse of Penn Central Railway in 1970. Third, learning from default may generate default correlation. For example, to the extent that the defaults of Enron and World- Com revealed accounting irregularities that could be present in other firms, they may have had a direct impact on the conditional default probabilities of other firms. Our primary objective is to examine whether cross-firm default correlation that is associa",

We consider a comprehensive list of price- and market-related return predictors in the stock market and construct their cryptocurrency counterparts. Ten cryptocurrency characteristics form success- ful long-short strategies that generate sizable and statistically signiﬁcant excess re- turns, and we show that all of these strategies are accounted for by the cryptocur- rency three-factor model. Lastly, we examine potential underlying mechanisms of the cryptocurrency size and momentum effects. THE Cryptocurrency Market HAS Experienced rapid growth. This mar- ket allows companies to raise money without engaging with venture capitalists and to be traded without being listed on stock exchanges.1 The entire set of coins in the crypto market ranges from well-known currencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple to much more obscure coins. There are two views on the cryptocurrency market. The ﬁrst is that most and perhaps all of the coins represent bubbles and fraud. The second is that the blockchain technology em- bodied in coins may become an important innovation and that at least some coins may be assets that represent a stake in the future of this technology. If the latter case is true, analyzing the cryptocurrency market from the empirical asset pricing point of view is important for two reasons: ﬁrst, to establish a set of empirical regularities that",

Given a set of candidate traded factors, we develop a related test procedure that permits the computation of model probabilities for the collection of all possible pricing models that are based on subsets of the given factors. We ﬁnd that the recent models of Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015a, 2015b) and Fama and French (2015, 2016) are dominated by a variety of models that include a momentum factor, along with value and proﬁtability factors that are updated monthly. Given THE Variety OF Portfolio-based factors that have been examined by re- searchers, it is important to understand how best to combine them in a parsi- monious asset pricing model for expected returns, one that excludes redundant factors. Although there are standard econometric techniques for evaluating the adequacy of a single model, a satisfactory statistical methodology for identi- fying the best factor pricing model(s) is conspicuously lacking in investment procedure that allows us to compute model probabilities for the collection of all possible pricing models that can be formed from a given set of factors.

    "abstract": "We propose a labor market model in which ﬁnancial ﬁrms compete for a scarce supply of workers who can be employed as either bankers or traders. While hiring bankers helps create a surplus that can be split between a ﬁrm and its trading counterparties, hiring traders helps the ﬁrm appropriate a greater share of that surplus away from its counterparties. Firms bid defensively for workers bound to become traders, who then earn more than bankers. As counterparties employ more traders, the beneﬁt of employing bankers decreases. The model sheds light on the historical evolution of compensation in ﬁnance. Compensation IN THE FINANCIALsector has been a controversial topic in recent years. One particular group of workers who tend to earn extraordinary rewards for their expertise are traders in over-the-counter (OTC) markets. For instance, before the recent crisis, managing directors trading exotic credit derivatives earned on average $3.4 million per year.1 More recently, average salaries paid to various types of traders (e.g., commodities, securitized-products) grew by 10% in 2014 alone.2 Karp and Jessica Lee from Options Group for sharing their statistics on Wall Street compensa- tion and for discussing the ideas in the paper.

    "abstract": "The common folklore that giving options to agents will make them more willing to take risks is false. In fact, no incentive schedule will make all expected utility maximizers more or less risk averse. This paper finds simple, intuitive, necessary and sufficient conditions under which incentive schedules make agents more or less risk averse. The paper uses these to examine the incentive effects of some common structures such as puts and calls, and it briefly explores the duality between a fee schedule that makes an agent more or less risk averse, and gambles that increase or decrease risk. With THE Growing Interest in executive compensation and agency problems, there is a folklore about the relation between the shape of the fee schedule received by an agent and the agent’s attitudes toward risk that deserves fur- ther study. As an illustration, many authors take it for granted that giving op- tions to executives makes them more willing to take risks. DeFusco, Johnson, and Zorn (1990, p. 618), for example, note that “The asymmetric payoffs of call options make it more attractive for managers to undertake risky projects.” In fact, contrary to their intuition, my intuition, and that of most observers, without further conditions on utility functions beyond monotonicity and risk aversion, this is not correct. Surprisingly, it is not the case that a convex com- pensation schedule makes an agent more willing to take risks, that is, less risk averse; nor does a concave compensation sc",

Although analyst behavior was influenced by economic incentives, we find no evidence that aggressive analyst behavior increased their bank’s probability of winning an under- writing mandate.

    "abstract": "This paper explores the competition between two trading venues, Electronic Communication Networks (ECNs) and Nasdaq market makers. ECNs offer the advantages of anonymity and speed of execution, which attract informed tra- ders. Thus, trades are more likely to occur on ECNs when information asym- metry is greater and when trading volume and stock-return volatility are high. ECN trades have greater permanent price impacts and more private informa- tion is revealed through ECN trades than though market-maker trades. How- ever, ECN trades have higher ex ante trading costs because market makers can preference or internalize the less informed trades and offer them better execu- tions. Technological innovations that enable high-speed, low-cost electronic trading systems are dramatically changing the structure of financial markets. Ex- changes and markets around the world are merging or forming alliances to im- prove liquidity and reduce costs in the face of increased competition from each other and from these computerized trading systems.

    "abstract": "This paper studies the decision of lead investment banks to organize hybrid syndicates (commercial banks participating as co-managers) versus pure investment bank syn- dicates. The findings show that hybrid underwriting issues are more challenging to float. Compared to pure investment bank syndicates, hybrid syndicates serve clients that are smaller, have lower common stock rankings and less prior access to the capi- tal markets, rely more on bank loans, and invest less capital but issue larger amounts, which indicates that commercial banks’ participation enhances hybrid services. More- over, lead investment banks tend to invite banks’ participation when clients exhibit higher loyalty in reusing their services. This Paper Utilizes A Unique opportunity created by the Federal Reserve Board to empirically examine the economics of syndicate formation. In 1989, the Board granted five commercial banks permission to underwrite corporate bonds through the so-called “Section 20 Subsidiaries” (Federal Reserve (1989)). Dur- ing the process of repealing the Glass–Steagall Act, which separated commer- cial banking and investment banking in the United States, incumbent invest- ment banks (IB) were the major opponents of the repeal.

    "abstract": "We study the rivalry between Euronext and the London Stock Exchange (LSE) in the Dutch stock market to test hypotheses about the effect of market fragmentation. As predicted by our theory, the consolidated limit order book is deeper after entry of the LSE. Moreover, cross-sectionally, we find that a higher trade-through rate in the en- trant market coincides with less liquidity supply in this market. These findings imply that (i) fragmentation of order flow can enhance liquidity supply and (ii) protecting limit orders against trade-throughs is important. THE Proliferation OF Electronic Trading venues raises new questions about the benefits and costs of market fragmentation. In the United States, this evolution triggered several debates on the organization of equity markets and culminated in new SEC rules, known as Regulation NMS. 1 This paper addresses two ques- tions central in these debates: (i) Does centralization of order flow improve liquidity and (ii) should limit orders be protected against violations of price priority? To this end, we study the entry of the London Stock Exchange into the Dutch equity market with the launch of EuroSETS, an electronic limit order market.

    "abstract": "In this study, we show that the effect of diversification on performance is not homo- geneous across industries and explore analytically and empirically the implications of this finding for the diversification literature. Diversified firms perform better in industries with a small number of nondiversified competitors or, equivalently, when specialized firms have a small combined market share, but worse as the presence of specialized firms increases in the industries in which they compete. The results are robust to the use of methods that alleviate the self-selection problem and call for a reassessment of the diversification–performance relationship. Firm diversification has been widely researched both theoretically and empir- ically in the fields of Corporate Finance, Industrial Organization, and Strategic Management for more than 30 years. The main common goal of this work has been to determine the effect of diversification on the creation or destruction of diversifiers versus specialized firms (i.e., nondiversifiers that operate only in one industry). However, few studies directly address the fundamental ques- tion of how the diversification–performance linkage varies across industries. The underlying argument in our paper is that diversification strategies could systematically create shareholder value in some industries but destroy it in others. Previous studies overlook this point focusing on the estimation of an aver- age effect of diversification on performance that is",

    "abstract": "This paper examines the effect of recent market reforms on the competitive struc- ture of the Nasdaq. Our results show that changes in inventory and information costs cannot explain the post-reform decrease in bid-ask spreads. We interpret this as evidence that the reforms have reduced Nasdaq dealers' rents. Additionally, we find that the difference between Nyse and Nasdaq spreads have been greatly diminished with the new rules. Further, the reforms have resulted in an exit, ceteris paribus, from the industry for market making. Overall, our results provide strong evidence that the reforms have improved competition on the Nasdaq. ON January 20, 1997, the Securities and Exchange Commission began im- plementing a new set of regulations that have drastically changed the way the Nasdaq handles orders. These regulations were formulated in response to evidence of imperfect competition under the Nasdaq's previous trading rules. The avoidance of odd-eighth quotes documented by Christie and Schultz (1994) and the large difference in trading costs compared to the Nyse, re- ported by Huang and Stoll (1996), have led some researchers and policy- makers to question the efficiency of the Nasdaq's dealer market structure. One result of this intensified scrutiny of the Nasdaq has been the imposition of a new set of trading rules aimed at reducing investors' trading costs and promoting greater competition without adversely affecting market quality. The purpose of this study is to investigate h",

    "title": "Competition, Market Structure, and Bid-Ask",
    "abstract": "This paper examines the effects of competition and market structure on equity option bid-ask spreads from 1986 to 1997. Options listed on multiple exchanges have narrower spreads than those listed on a single exchange, but the difference diminishes as option volume increases. Option spreads become wider when a com- peting exchange delists the option. Options traded under a \"Designated Primary Marketmaker\" (DPM) have narrower quoted spreads than those traded in a tradi- tional open outcry crowd. Effective spreads are found to be slightly narrower under the DPM than in the crowd, but only since 1992, and only on low-volume options. As WE Enter THE 21ST Century, securities exchanges and regulators around the world face many challenges. Given the current trends toward liberaliza- tion and globalization of capital markets, the democratization of information technology, the development of new lower-cost trading mechanisms, and the expansion of derivatives markets in developed and emerging economies, the need to understand the relationship between competition, market structure, and market quality is greater than ever. The exchange-traded options market in the United States is a natural ture of the industry affect market quality. Options trade under both open outcry and specialist mechanisms, in some cases within the same exchange. Moreover, there have been several regulatory regime changes affecting the level of competition between exchanges. Compared to the vast empirical mar- ket",

    "abstract": "Investors’ individual arbitrage models introduce idiosyncratic risk into complex as- set strategies, driving up average returns and Sharpe ratios. However, despite the attractive risk-return trade-off, participation is limited. This is because effective Sharpe ratios in complex asset markets vary with investors’ expertise. Investors with higher expertise, better models, and lower resulting idiosyncratic risk exposures re- alize higher Sharpe ratios. Their demand deters entry by less sophisticated investors. As predicted by our model, market dislocations are characterized by an increase in idiosyncratic risk, investor exit, and persistently elevated alphas and Sharpe ratios. The selection effect from higher expertise agents’ more favorable Sharpe ratios is unique to our model and key to our main results. Complex Assets Have Limited Direct participation, despite their attrac- tive risk-return trade-offs. Duarte, Longstaff, and Yu ( 2006) rank ﬁve relative- value ﬁxed income strategies needing more versus less intellectual capital, and show that more sophisticated strategies have higher returns and Sharpe ra- tios. Haddad and Muir ( 2021) show that assets that are more intermediated have higher excess returns normalized by volatility. The puzzle in these mar- kets is not that limited participation leads to higher returns or Sharpe ratios. Instead, it is the converse: Why is participation low in asset classes with more attractive risk-return trade-offs? A related puzzle is: Why i",

    "title": "Concentrating on Governance",
    "abstract": "This paper develops a novel trade-off view of corporate governance. Using a model that integrates agency costs and bargaining beneﬁts of management-friendly provisions, we identify the economic determinants of the resulting trade-offs for shareholder value. Consistent with the theory, our empirical analysis shows that provisions that allow managers to delay takeovers have signiﬁcant bargaining effects and a positive relation with shareholder value in concentrated industries. By contrast, non-delay provisions have an unambiguously negative relation with value, particularly in con- centrated industries. Our analysis suggests that there are governance trade-offs for shareholders and that industry concentration is an important determinant of their severity. THE Importance OF Corporate governance has long been recognized among ﬁnancial economists, institutional investors, and practitioners, as well as policy makers. However, as Shleifer and Vishny (1997, p. 737) note, “even in advanced market economies, there is a great deal of disagreement on how good or bad the existing governance mechanisms are.” To further our understanding of existing governance mechanisms, this paper takes a novel approach. We develop a uniﬁed account of the costs and beneﬁts of external governance and explore the economic determinants of the resulting trade-offs for shareholder value. Our novel perspective explains shareholder governance trade-offs, why they arise, and how they vary across ﬁrms and industri",

    "title": "Conditional Skewness in Asset Pricing Tests",
    "abstract": "If asset returns have systematic skewness, expected returns should include re- wards for accepting this risk. We formalize this intuition with an asset pricing model that incorporates conditional skewness. Our results show that conditional skewness helps explain the cross-sectional variation of expected returns across assets and is significant even when factors based on size and book-to-market are included. Systematic skewness is economically important and commands a risk premium, on average, of 3.60 percent per year. Our results suggest that the mo- mentum effect is related to systematic skewness. The low expected return momen- tum portfolios have higher skewness than high expected return portfolios. Lintner (1965) has come under recent scrutiny. Tests indicate that the cross- asset variation in expected returns cannot be explained by the market beta alone. For example, a growing number of studies show that \"fundamental\" variables such as size, book-to-market value, and price to earnings ratios account for a sizeable portion of the cross-sectional variation in expected returns (see, e.g., Chan, Hamao, and Lakonishok (1991) and Fama and French (1992)). Fama and French (1995) document the importance of SMB (the dif- ference between the return on a portfolio of small size stocks and the return on a portfolio of large size stocks) and HML (the difference between the return on a portfolio of high book-to-market value stocks and the return on a portfolio of low book-to-market valu",

    "abstract": "I develop and estimate a model of cash auction bankruptcy using data on 205 Swedish firms. The results challenge arguments that cash auctions, as compared to reorganizations, are immune to conflicts of interest between claimholders but lead to inefficient liquidations. I show that a sale of the assets back to incumbent management is a common bankruptcy outcome. Sale-backs are more likely when they favor the bank at the expense of other creditors. On the other hand, ineffi- cient liquidations are frequently avoided through sale-backs when markets are illiquid, that is, when industry indebtedness is high and the firm has few nonspe- cific assets. THE Problem OF Designing an efficient bankruptcy law has received consid- erable attention in the last decade. Much of the debate has centered around the optimality of two different stylized bankruptcy procedures: cash auc- tions, such as the U.S. Chapter 7 code, and structured bargaining, repre- sented by the U.S. Chapter 11 reorganization code. Recently, several European countries (including France, Germany, and Great Britain) have changed their bankruptcy regulation by introducing reorganization procedures similar to Chapter 11. At the same time, the Chapter 11 code has been criticized by academics, including Baird (1986), emphasizing that the bargaining proce- dure frequently results in long and wasteful negotiations. These critics ar- gue that Chapter 11 should instead be replaced with a mandatory auction procedure. Other research",

    "abstract": "Do behavioral biases of executives matter for corporate investment decisions? Using segment-level capital allocation in multisegment ﬁrms (“conglomerates”) as a labora- tory, we show that capital expenditure is increasing in the expected skewness of seg- ment returns. Conglomerates invest more in high-skewness segments than matched stand-alone ﬁrms, and trade at a discount, which indicates overinvestment that is detrimental to shareholder wealth. Using geographical variation in gambling norms, we ﬁnd that the skewness-investment relation is particularly pronounced when CEOs are likely to ﬁnd long shots attractive. Our ﬁndings suggest that CEOs allocate capital with a long-shot bias. Making Investment Decisions that maximize shareholder value is the central task of corporate managers, and every MBA curriculum features state-of-the- art valuation tools prominently. Nevertheless, making investment decisions in the real world is difﬁcult because even the best valuation tools rely to a consid- erable extent on assumptions that are subjective.1 Consistent with substantial residual uncertainty around true project value, about half of the CEOs sur- veyed in Graham, Harvey, and Puri (2015) mention “gut feel” as an important or very important factor in their investment and capital allocation decisions.

    "abstract": "We connect stocks through their common active mutual fund owners. We show that the degree of shared ownership forecasts cross-sectional variation in return correlation, controlling for exposure to systematic return factors, style and sector similarity, and many other pair characteristics. We argue that shared ownership causes this excess comovement based on evidence from a natural experiment—the 2003 mutual fund trading scandal. These results motivate a novel cross-stock-reversal trading strategy exploiting information contained in ownership connections. We show that long-short hedge fund index returns covary negatively with this strategy, suggesting these funds may exacerbate this excess comovement. Barberis and Shleifer (2003) and Barberis, Shleifer, and Wurgler (2005)a r - gue that institutional features may play an important role in the movement of stocks’ discount rates, causing returns to comove above and beyond the comove- ment implied by their fundamentals. In this paper, we propose a new approach to document that type of institutional-based comovement. Based on mounting evidence since Coval and Stafford (2007) that mutual fund ﬂows result in price pressure, we focus on connecting stocks through active mutual fund owner- ship. Speciﬁcally, we forecast cross-sectional variation in return correlation for stock pairs using the degree of common ownership by active mutual funds.

    "abstract": "Why do negative credit events lead to long-term borrowing constraints? Exploiting banking regulations in Peru and utilizing currency movements, we show that con- sumers who face a credit rating downgrade due to bad luck experience a three-year reduction in ﬁnancing. Consumers respond to the shock by paying down their most troubled loans, but nonetheless end up more likely to exit the credit market. For a set of borrowers who experience severe delinquency, we ﬁnd that the associated credit reporting downgrade itself accounts for 25% to 65% of their observed decline in borrowing at various horizons over the following several years. THE Recovery From THE Recession OF 2008 has been anemic.

What explains the power and duration of these ﬁnan- cial constraints? While it is clear that many households experienced negative credit events during the recession, what is less apparent is precisely why these events might have had such long-lasting consequences for access to loans.

    "title": "Consumer Ruthlessness and Mortgage Default",
    "abstract": "From 2007 to 2009 U.S. House prices plunged and mortgage defaults surged. While os- tensibly consistent with widespread “ruthless default,” analysis of detailed mortgage and house price data indicates that borrowers do not walk away until they are deeply underwater—far deeper than traditional models predict. The evidence suggests that lender recourse is not the major driver of this result. We argue that emotional and behavioral factors play an important role in decisions to continue paying. Borrower reluctance to walk away implies that the moral hazard cost of default as a form of social insurance may be lower than suspected. From 2007 TO 2009 House Prices in the United States plunged, especially in many areas of Arizona, California, Florida, and Nevada (Figure 1). At roughly the same time, mortgage defaults surged, consistent with the predictions of option-theoretic models of mortgage pricing where borrowers “ruthlessly” de- fault to maximize their wealth (Foster and Van Order ( 1984, 1985)). Numerous media anecdotes suggest that ruthless defaults were widespread, and the pre- sumed wave of such defaults has led economists and policy makers to propose ways to address ruthless or strategic defaulters. In this paper, we assess how closely borrower behavior conforms to neoclassical models of default using rich microdata where we know the precise timing of defaults and the evolution of house prices at the ZIP code level. We ﬁnd that home equity has to turn deeply negative before",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel consumption-based variable, cyclical consumption, and examines its predictive properties for stock returns. Future expected stock returns are high (low) when aggregate consumption falls (rises) relative to its trend and marginal utility from current consumption is high (low). We show that the empiri- cal evidence ties consumption decisions of agents to time variation in returns in a manner consistent with asset pricing models based on external habit formation. The predictive power of cyclical consumption is not conﬁned to bad times and subsumes the predictability of many popular forecasting variables. IN This Paper , WE Take a new approach to linking stock return predictability to both bad and good economic times. Consider an economy in which investors exhibit external habit formation as in, for example, Campbell and Cochrane (1999), and as a result, risk premia vary over time through variation in risk aversion. In good times, when consumption rises above its trend and hence the marginal utility of present consumption is low, investors are willing to give up current consumption and invest. This, in turn, forces stock prices to increase and future expected returns to decrease. Conversely, in bad times, when consumption falls below its trend and hence the marginal utility of current consumption is high, expected returns in the future need to be high in order to induce investors to postpone the valuable present consumption and to invest and consume",

    "abstract": "We show that time variation in macroeconomic uncertainty affects asset prices. Con- sumption volatility is a negatively priced source of risk for a wide variety of test portfo- lios. At the ﬁrm level, exposure to consumption volatility risk predicts future returns, generating a spread across quintile portfolios in excess of 7% annually. This premium is explained by cross-sectional differences in the sensitivity of dividend volatility to consumption volatility. Stocks with volatile cash ﬂows in uncertain aggregate times require higher expected returns. IT HAS Long Been recognized that the volatility of macroeconomic quantities, such as consumption and output, varies over time.1 Surprisingly, the impact of consumption growth volatility on asset prices has received little attention in empirical tests of consumption-based pricing models2—most papers use only the ﬁrst moment of consumption growth (e.g., Lettau and Ludvigson (2001), Parker and Julliard (2005), and Yogo (2006)). The contribution of this paper is to show that exposure to time-varying consumption volatility leads to a risk premium that can be explained by cross-sectional differences in cash ﬂow loadings.

    "abstract": "This paper studies the role of fluctuations in the aggregate consumption-wealth ratio for predicting stock returns. Using U.S. Quarterly stock market data, we find that these fluctuations in the consumption-wealth ratio are strong predictors of both real stock returns and excess returns over a Treasury bill rate. We also find that this variable is a better forecaster of future returns at short and intermediate horizons than is the dividend yield, the dividend payout ratio, and several other popular forecasting variables. Why should the consumption-wealth ratio forecast asset returns? We show that a wide class of optimal models of consumer behavior imply that the log consumption-aggregate wealth (human capital plus asset hold- ings) ratio summarizes expected returns on aggregate wealth, or the market port- folio. Although this ratio is not observable, we provide assumptions under which its important predictive components for future asset returns may be expressed in terms of observable variables, namely in terms of consumption, asset holdings and labor income. The framework implies that these variables are cointegrated, and that deviations from this shared trend summarize agents' expectations of future returns on the market portfolio. Understanding THE Empirical Linkages between macroeconomic variables and financial markets has long been a goal of financial economics. One reason for the interest in these linkages is that expected excess returns on common stocks appear to vary w",

    "abstract": "We show that aggregate consumption risks embodied in cash flows can account for the puzzling differences in risk premia across book-to-market, momentum, and size- sorted portfolios. The dynamics of aggregate consumption and cash flow growth rates, modeled as a vector autoregression, are used to measure the consumption beta of discounted cash flows. Differences in these cash flow betas account for more than 60% of the cross-sectional variation in risk premia. The market price for risk in cash flows is highly significant. We argue that cash flow risk is important for interpreting differences in risk compensation across assets. THE Idea That Differences IN Exposure to systematic risk should justify differ- ences in risk premia across assets is central to asset pricing. The static Capm (capital asset-pricing model) (see Sharpe (1964) and Lintner (1965)) implies that assets’ exposures to aggregate wealth should determine cross-sectional differences in risk premia. The work of Lucas (1978) and Breeden (1979) ar- gues that the risk premium on an asset is determined by its ability to insure against consumption fluctuations. Hence, the exposure of asset returns to move- ments in aggregate consumption (i.e., the consumption betas) should determine cross-sectional differences in risk premia. Evidence presented in Hansen and Singleton (1982) for the consumption-based models, and in Fama and French (1992) for the Capm, shows that these models have considerable difficulty in justifying the",

    "abstract": "Financial contagion is described as a wealth effect in a continuous-time model with two risky assets and three types of traders. Noise traders trade randomly in one market. Long-term investors provide liquidity using a linear rule based on funda- mentals. Convergence traders with logarithmic utility trade optimally in both mar- kets. Asset price dynamics are endogenously determined (numerically) as functions of endogenous wealth and exogenous noise. When convergence traders lose money, they liquidate positions in both markets. This creates contagion, in that returns become more volatile and more correlated. Contagion reduces benefits from port- folio diversification and raises issues for risk management. During THE Financial Panic Associated with the default of the Russian govern- ment in August 1998 and the subsequent collapse of the hedge fund Long Term Capital Management, numerous hedge funds, banks, and securities firms tried simultaneously to reduce exposures to a variety of financial instruments, such as Russian bonds, Brazilian stocks, U.S. Mortgages, spreads between on-the- run and off-the-run government securities, and spreads between swaps and U.S. Treasuries. Although the fundamental values of these positions would appear to have little correlation, during this financial crisis, the asset prices in these markets exhibited the following common empirical pattern: 1.

    "abstract": "I survey and assess the development of continuous-time methods in finance during the last 30 years. The subperiod 1969 to 1980 saw a dizzying pace of development with seminal ideas in derivatives securities pricing, term structure theory, asset pricing, and optimal consumption and portfolio choices. During the period 1981 to 1999 the theory has been extended and modified to better explain empirical reg- ularities in various subfields of finance. This latter subperiod has seen significant progress in econometric theory, computational and estimation methods to test and implement continuous-time models. Capital market frictions and bargaining is- sues are being increasingly incorporated in continuous-time theory. THE Roots OF Modern Continuous-time Methods in finance can be traced back to the seminal contributions of Merton (1969, 1971, 1973b) in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Merton (1969) pioneered the use of continuous-time modeling in financial economics by formulating the intertemporal consumption and port- folio choice problem of an investor in a stochastic dynamic programming set- ting. Merton (1973b) also showed how such a framework can be used to develop equilibrium asset pricing implications, thereby significantly extending the as- set pricing theory to richer dynamic settings and expanding the scope of ap- plications of continuous-time methods to study problems in financial economics.'

    "abstract": "We consider multiagent multiﬁrm contracting when agents benchmark their wages to those of their peers, using weights that vary within and across ﬁrms. When a single principal commits to a public contract, optimal contracts hedge relative wage risk without sacriﬁcing efﬁciency . But compensation benchmarking undoes performance benchmarking, causing wages to load positively on peer output, and asymmetries in peer effects can be exploited to enhance proﬁts. With multiple principals, a “rat race” emerges: agents are more productive, with effort that can exceed the ﬁrst best, but higher wages reduce proﬁts and undermine efﬁciency . Wage transparency and disclosure requirements exacerbate these effects. Contract AND Incentive Theory HAS provided powerful insight into the optimal design of compensation schemes. Chief among them, for instance, is the idea that contracts should provide higher compensation when output suggests that the agent was more likely to have engaged in desired behavior.

    "title": "Convertible Bond Design and Capital",
    "abstract": "If firms issue convertible securities to facilitate sequential investment, the securities should be engineered to give sufficient flexibility to accommodate timing of follow-on investment. We examine call provisions in convertible bonds and argue that firms with investment options expected to expire sooner (later) will offer weaker (stronger) call protection. We find that issues with weak or no call protection are offered by firms that invest greater amounts soon after issuance than those issuing convertibles with strong protection. Moreover, capital expenditure levels during the 5-year period following issuance are inversely related to the length of call-protection periods. Most Convertible Bonds AND Notes have call provisions, and most provisions have important qualifications or protection. Broadly speaking, convertibles may have absolute protection (not callable), hard call protection (noncallable for a specified period), provisional or soft call protection (callable if certain conditions on stock price are met), or no protection (callable anytime). In this study, we investigate the relations between the strength and length of call protection and firms’ subsequent investment behavior. Our hypothesis is a natural implication of the sequential financing motive for convertible debt financing. For example, in Mayers (1998), firms finance their planned multistage investment programs with convertibles. Besides Mayers’ sequential financing motive, other explanations for convertib",

    "abstract": "This paper offers a new explanation for the prevalent use of convertible secu- rities in venture capital finance. Convertible securities can be used to endo- genously allocate cash-flow rights as a function of the state of the world and the entrepreneur's effort. This property can be used to induce the entrepreneur and the venture capitalist to invest efficiently into the project. The result is robust to renegotiation and to changes in the timing of investments and infor- mation flows. The model is consistent with the observations that conversion is often automatic and that convertible securities are rarely used by outside investors.",

    "title": "Conﬂicting Family Values in Mutual Fund",
    "abstract": "We analyze the investment behavior of afﬁliated funds of mutual funds (AFoMFs), which are mutual funds that can only invest in other funds in the family, and are offered by most large families. Though never mentioned in any prospectus, we discover that AFoMFs provide an insurance pool against temporary liquidity shocks to other funds in the family. We show that, though the family beneﬁts because funds can avoid ﬁre sales, the cost of this insurance is borne by the investors in the AFoMFs. The paper thus uncovers some of the hidden complexities of ﬁduciary responsibility in mutual fund families. A Major Reason FOR the existence of conglomerates or business groups is to create internal capital markets to promote the efﬁciency of the group. One of many efﬁciency measures that internal capital markets can offer is an insur- ance pool, which provides temporary liquidity to the members of the group in the event of adverse shocks.1 If mutual fund families, which are a collection of legally independent entities tied together by the sponsoring management company, are regarded as groups, it seems reasonable to assume that there would be a group interest. 2 If so, it seems natural to ask whether insurance pools could exist in these families where cash-rich mutual funds direct capital to family funds that are facing thank the Editor (Cam Harvey), the Associate Editor, an anonymous referee, Sudheer Chava, Nishant Dass, Nandini Gupta, Cam Harvey, Mike Hemler, Ravi Jagannathan, Sreenivas Ka",

We assume that, as in practice, covenants convey the right to accelerate if violated, but the new secured debt retains its priority even if issued in violation of covenants. We ﬁnd that such covenants are nonetheless useful: They provide state- contingent ﬁnancing ﬂexibility , balancing over- and underinvestment incentives. The optimal debt structure is multilayered, combining secured and unsecured debt with and without covenants.

    "abstract": "Agency theories predict that older ﬁrms make value-destroying acquisitions to ben- eﬁt managers. Neoclassical theories predict instead that such ﬁrms make wealth- increasing acquisitions to exploit underutilized assets. Using IPO cohorts, we estab- lish that, while younger ﬁrms make more related and diversifying acquisitions than mature ﬁrms, the acquisition rate follows a U-shape over ﬁrms’ life cycle. Consistent with neoclassical theories, we show that acquiring ﬁrms have better performance and growth opportunities and create wealth through acquisitions of nonpublic ﬁrms throughout their life. Consistent with agency theories, older ﬁrms experience negative stock price reactions for acquisitions of public ﬁrms. Existing Theories ON THE Role OF Acquisitions and diversiﬁcation over the life cycle of ﬁrms offer two very different views. Agency theories predict that ﬁrms make wealth-destroying acquisitions and diversify when they are mature because their cash ﬂow outstrips their internal growth opportunities and man- agement becomes more entrenched, so that it pursues growth at the expense of shareholders (e.g., Mueller ( 1972) and Jensen ( 1986, 1993)). Neoclassical theories predict, instead, that ﬁrms pursue acquisitions in an effort to make the best use of their valuable scarce assets (see Maksimovic and Phillips ( 2013) for a review). As a result, better-performing ﬁrms and ﬁrms with better growth opportunities create value through acquisitions, including diversifying acqui-",

However, penalties for dissent appeared to have little impact on the experimental outcomes. Consider THE Situation OF Owners of a corporation when they entrust the fate of their institution to groups of insiders. Because the owner-preferred allocation may be contingent on private information possessed by the insiders, owners need a mechanism to mitigate conflicts of interest with insiders. In practice, owners entrust the governance of corporations and other institutions to boards and com- mittees consisting of a mix of insiders and outsiders. Corporate boards are in- creasingly being dominated by independent outside directors (see, e.g., Spencer Stuart (1997)), a trend mirroring the recommendations of the National Associa- tion of Corporate Directors and The Business Roundtable.1 The advocacy of independent outsider-dominated boards is surprising as re- search has produced weak or mixed results on the effectiveness of outsiders on boards.

    "title": "Corporate Bond Market Transaction Costs",
    "abstract": "Using a complete record of U.S. Over-the-counter (OTC) secondary trades in corporate bonds, we estimate average transaction costs as a function of trade size for each bond that traded more than nine times between January 2003 and January 2005. We find that transaction costs decrease significantly with trade size. Highly rated bonds, recently issued bonds, and bonds close to maturity have lower transaction costs than do other bonds. Costs are lower for bonds with transparent trade prices, and they drop when the Trace system starts to publicly disseminate their prices. The results suggest that public traders benefit significantly from price transparency. Secondary Transaction Costs IN THE Corporate bond markets are not widely known outside of the community of professional fixed income traders. Given the importance of bond financing in our economy—the aggregate values of corpo- rate bonds and equities are roughly equal in the United States—it is somewhat surprising that so little is known about the costs of trading bonds. This study characterizes these costs using a record of every corporate bond trade reported between January 2003 and January 2005. Bond transaction costs are not well known because corporate bond markets are not nearly as transparent as are equity markets. 1 Dealers provide public ∗Amy Edwards is a Financial Economist in the Office of Economic Analysis of the U.S. Se- curities and Exchange Commission.

    "abstract": "We study corporate control tracing controlling shareholders for thousands of listed ﬁrms from 127 countries over 2004 to 2012. Government and family control is per- vasive in civil-law countries. Blocks are commonplace, but less so in common-law countries. These patterns apply to large, medium, and small ﬁrms. In contrast, the development-control nexus is heterogeneous; strong for large but absent for small ﬁrms. Control correlates strongly with shareholder protection, the stringency of employment contracts and unions power. Conversely, the correlations with creditor rights, legal formalism, and entry regulation appear weak. These patterns support both legal origin and political theories of ﬁnancial development. Understanding THE Determinants AND consequences of the various types of corporate control is of ﬁrst-order importance in corporate ﬁnance (La Porta, Lopez-de Silanes, and Shleifer (1999), Tirole (2006)). Although most theory distinguishes between widely held corporations with dispersed ownership and ﬁrms in which a dominant shareholder exerts control (Shleifer and Vishny (1997)), corporate structures are complex (Laeven and Levine (2008)). For instance, equity blocks can be found in most widely held corporations (Edmans and Holderness (2017)). In addition, pyramids that allow shareholders to inﬂu- ence decisions over their cash ﬂow rights and cross-holdings of equity in busi- ness groups are widespread (Dyck and Zingales (2004)).

    "abstract": "Prior literature finds that diversified firms sell at a discount relative to the sum of the imputed values of their business segments. We explore this documented dis- count and argue that it stems from risk-reducing effects of corporate diversifica- tion. Consistent with this risk-reduction hypothesis, we find that (a) shareholder losses in diversification are a function of firm leverage, (b) all equity firms do not exhibit a diversification discount, and (c) using book values of debt to compute excess value creates a downward bias for diversified firms. Overall, the results indicate that diversification is insignificantly related to excess firm value. A Stream OF Literature Suggests that corporate diversification is associated with a substantial reduction in firm value. An underlying theme of this literature is that conglomerates tend to misallocate their investment funds by cross subsidizing poorly performing divisions. Berger and Ofek (1995), for example, document that conglomerates are prone to cross-subsidize invest- ments in divisions with poor growth opportunities. Consistent with this find- ing, Rajan, Servaes, and Zingales (2000) model the presence of power struggles among the firm's divisions and show that diversification causes resources to flow to inefficient investments. Similarly, Scharfstein and Stein (2000) dem- onstrate how rent-seeking divisional managers can subvert the internal cap- ital allocation decision. These studies depict conglomerates as organizati",

    "abstract": "We examine whether organizational form matters for a ﬁrm’s cost of capital. Con- trary to the conventional view, we argue that coinsurance among a ﬁrm’s business units can reduce systematic risk through the avoidance of countercyclical deadweight costs. We ﬁnd that diversiﬁed ﬁrms have, on average, a lower cost of capital than comparable portfolios of stand-alone ﬁrms. In addition, diversiﬁed ﬁrms with less correlated segment cash ﬂows have a lower cost of capital, consistent with a coinsur- ance effect. Holding cash ﬂows constant, our estimates imply an average value gain of approximately 5% when moving from the highest to the lowest cash ﬂow correlation quintile. The conventional view among practitioners and researchers is that organi- zational form does not matter for a ﬁrm’s cost of capital because, while the imperfect correlation of business unit cash ﬂows may help reduce idiosyncratic risk, this should have no effect on systematic risk. Long a part of mainstream thought, the conventional view is widely disseminated through standard ﬁ- nance textbooks and classroom teaching. The notion that corporate diversiﬁca- tion cannot affect systematic risk is usually covered explicitly in the mergers and acquisitions chapter1 or implicitly through the stand-alone principle in the capital budgeting chapter.

    "abstract": "We assemble a sample of over 10,000 customer–supplier relationships and determine whether the customer owns equity in the supplier. We find that factors related to both contractual incompleteness and financial market frictions are important in the decision of a customer firm to take an equity stake in their supplier. Evidence on the variation in the size of observed equity positions suggests that there are limits to the size of optimal ownership stakes in many relationships. Finally, we find that relationships accompanied by equity ownership last significantly longer than other relationships, suggesting that ownership aids in bonding trading parties together. Corporations Often Hold Equity Blocks in other corporations. Despite the fre- quency of this occurrence, the motivation for these holdings is not well under- stood. In the context of product market relationships, partial equity ownership represents an organizational form that is potentially quite different both from no ownership and from complete vertical integration. Recent work by Allen and Phillips (2000) suggests that there may be some unique benefits to this alternative organizational form; however, the picture is far from complete. In this paper, we study the decision to take an equity stake in a trading partner in a sample of over 10,000 customer–supplier pairs from 1988 to 2001.

    "abstract": "We examine the cross-sectional variation in the marginal value of corporate cash hold- ings that arises from differences in corporate financial policy. We begin by providing semi-quantitative predictions for the value of an extra dollar of cash depending upon the likely use of that dollar, and derive a set of intuitive hypotheses to test empirically. By examining the variation in excess stock returns over the fiscal year, we find that the marginal value of cash declines with larger cash holdings, higher leverage, better access to capital markets, and as firms choose greater cash distribution via dividends rather than repurchases. What Value DO Shareholders Place ON THE Cash That Firms Hold , and how does that value differ across firms? While an extensive literature attempts to estimate the value of adding debt to a firm’s capital structure, the search for estimates of the value of additional cash has not received nearly as much attention. This is a non-trivial oversight considering that corporate liquidity enables firms to make investments without having to access external capital markets, and to thereby avoid both transaction costs on either debt or equity is- suance and information asymmetry costs that are often associated with equity issuances. Moreover, corporate liquidity reduces the likelihood of incurring fi- nancial distress costs if the firm’s operations do not generate sufficient cash flow to service obligatory debt payments.

Through a process of evolutionary selection, each agent gravitates toward strategies that generate the highest payoffs. Despite the fact that markets are perfect and agents maximize value, a financing hierarchy emerges in which straight debt dominates other financing choices.

In general, the smaller the probability of loss to outside investors, the more likely the firm is to issue the security and the smaller the security's underpricing. Terns. To explain security issuance preferences, researchers have extended the Modigliani and Miller (1958) analysis by allowing for the presence of market fric- tions such as transactions costs, taxes, and informational differences among agents (DeAngelo and Masulis (1980), Castanias (1983), and Myers and Majluf (1984)). These extensions, however, maintain the assumption that the security payoff structure is common knowledge. The assumption of common knowledge places extraordinary demands on the abilities and knowledge of agents (Simon (1972), Russell and Thaler (1985), and Thaler (1992)).

Fraud propensity increases with the level of investor beliefs about industry prospects but decreases when beliefs are extremely high. We ﬁnd that two mechanisms are at work: monitoring by investors and short-term executive compensation, both of which vary with investor beliefs about industry prospects.

Our starting point is the recent theoretical literature on fraud and investor beliefs about business conditions.

    "abstract": "We examine whether corporate governance mechanisms, especially the market for corporate control, affect the profitability of firm acquisitions. We find that acquir- ers with more antitakeover provisions experience significantly lower announcement- period abnormal stock returns. This supports the hypothesis that managers at firms protected by more antitakeover provisions are less subject to the disciplinary power of the market for corporate control and thus are more likely to indulge in empire-building acquisitions that destroy shareholder value. We also find that acquirers operating in more competitive industries or separating the positions of CEO and chairman of the board experience higher abnormal announcement returns. Following A String OF Corporate Scandals in the United States, legislators and regulators rushed to enact corporate governance reforms, which resulted in the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Yet, these reforms were in- stituted with little scientific evidence to support their purported benefits. As the impact of these reforms continues to be strongly felt, with further reforms likely in the future, it is of great economic import to understand how major corporate governance mechanisms affect shareholder wealth.

    "abstract": "We develop a dynamic tradeoff model to examine the importance of manager– shareholder conﬂicts in capital structure choice. In the model, ﬁrms face taxation, reﬁnancing costs, and liquidation costs. Managers own a fraction of the ﬁrms’ equity, capture part of the free cash ﬂow to equity as private beneﬁts, and have control over ﬁnancing decisions. Using data on leverage choices and the model’s predictions for different statistical moments of leverage, we ﬁnd that agency costs of 1.5% of eq- uity value on average are sufﬁcient to resolve the low-leverage puzzle and to explain the dynamics of leverage ratios. Our estimates also reveal that agency costs vary signiﬁcantly across ﬁrms and correlate with commonly used proxies for corporate governance. A Central Theme IN ﬁnancial economics is that incentive conﬂicts within the ﬁrm lead to distortions in corporate policy choices and to lower corporate perfor- mance. Because debt limits managerial ﬂexibility (Jensen (1986)), a particular objectives in capital structure choice. A prevalent view in the literature is that self-interested managers do not make capital structure decisions that maximize shareholder wealth. The capital structure of a ﬁrm should then be determined not only by market frictions such as taxes, bankruptcy costs, or reﬁnancing costs (as in Fisher, Heinkel, and Zechner (1989) ), but also by the severity of manager–shareholder conﬂicts.

We find that the announcement of these rules has a significant effect on firm value. Firms that are less compliant with the provisions of the rules earn positive abnormal returns compared to firms that are more compliant. We also find variation in the response across firm size. Large firms that are less compliant earn positive abnormal returns but small firms that are less compliant earn negative abnormal returns, suggesting that some provisions are detrimental to small firms.

For example, SOX imposes higher penalties on officers who are charged with forging documents and requires more timely disclosure of equity transac- tions by corporate insiders.

    "title": "Corporate Governance and Risk-Taking",
    "abstract": "Better investor protection could lead corporations to undertake riskier but value- enhancing investments. For example, better investor protection mitigates the taking of private benefits leading to excess risk-avoidance. Further, in better investor protection environments, stakeholders like creditors, labor groups, and the government are less effective in reducing corporate risk-taking for their self-interest. However, arguments can also be made for a negative relationship between investor protection and risk- taking. Using a cross-country panel and a U.S.-only sample, we find that corporate risk-taking and firm growth rates are positively related to the quality of investor protection. A Central Theme OF Corporate governance studies is how constraints on cor- porate decision makers’ pursuit of self-interest lead to firm value-maximizing behavior. In this paper we focus on how these mechanisms affect managerial risk choices in corporate investment decisions and their consequent implica- tions for growth. Building on the seminal work of La Porta et al. (1997, 1998), recent finance literature focuses on the effect of investor protection on the cost of capital (e.g., Shleifer and Wolfenzon (2002), Lombardo and Pagano (2002), and Castro, Clementi, and MacDonald (2004)). Poor investor protection creates the need for dominant owners (Burkart, Panunzi, and Shleifer (2003)).

    "title": "Corporate Governance, Idiosyncratic Risk,",
    "abstract": "We study the relationship of corporate governance policy and idiosyncratic risk. Firms with fewer antitakeover provisions display higher levels of idiosyncratic risk, trading activity, private information flow, and information about future earnings in stock prices. Trading interest by institutions, especially those active in merger arbitrage, strengthens the relationship of governance to idiosyncratic risk. Our results indicate that openness to the market for corporate control leads to more informative stock prices by encouraging collection of and trading on private information. Consistent with an information-flow interpretation, the component of volatility unrelated to gov- ernance is associated with the efficiency of corporate investment. THE Effect OF Corporate Governance on equity prices and the distribution of returns is an important issue in corporate finance. Gompers, Ishii, and Metrick (2003) and Cremers and Nair (2005) find that governance can directly influ- ence equity prices. These and other authors generally posit that management constraints and incentives are the mechanisms through which governance in- fluences prices. Any systematic effect on returns, however, also requires a link between governance provisions and investors’ expectations or information. For instance, Gompers et al. (2003) argue that in the early 1990s, investors might not have fully appreciated the agency costs engendered by weak governance. This paper extends the current understanding by showi",

    "abstract": "This paper examines whether ﬁrms in noncompetitive industries beneﬁt more from good governance than do ﬁrms in competitive industries. We ﬁnd that weak gov- ernance ﬁrms have lower equity returns, worse operating performance, and lower ﬁrm value, but only in noncompetitive industries. When exploring the causes of the inefﬁciency, we ﬁnd that weak governance ﬁrms have lower labor productivity and higher input costs, and make more value-destroying acquisitions, but, again, only in noncompetitive industries. We also ﬁnd that weak governance ﬁrms in noncompeti- tive industries are more likely to be targeted by activist hedge funds, suggesting that investors take actions to mitigate the inefﬁciency. Economists Often Argue THATmanagers of ﬁrms in competitive industries have strong incentives to reduce slack and maximize proﬁts, or else the ﬁrm will go out of business.1 Accordingly, the need to provide managers with incentives through good governance—and thus the beneﬁts of good governance—should be smaller for ﬁrms in competitive industries. In contrast, ﬁrms in noncompetitive industries, where lack of competitive pressure fails to enforce discipline on managers, should beneﬁt relatively more from good governance. That ﬁrms with good governance have better performanceon averageis well established. In a seminal article, Gompers, Ishii, and Metrick (2003, GIM) ﬁnd that a hedge portfolio that is long in good governance ﬁrms (“Democracy ﬁrms”) and short in weak governance ﬁrms (“Dictat",

Further, technological overlap between ﬁrm pairs has a positive effect on transaction incidence, and this effect is reduced for ﬁrm pairs that overlap in product markets.

    "abstract": "We present a rational theory of SEOs that explains a pre-issuance price run-up, a negative announcement effect, and long-run post-issuance underperformance. When SEOs finance investment in a real options framework, expected returns decrease endogenously because growth options are converted into assets in place. Regard- less of their risk, the new assets are less risky than the options they replace. Although both size and book-to-market effects are present, standard matching proce- dures fail to fully capture the dynamics of risk and expected return. We calibrate the model and show that it closely matches the primary features of SEO return dynamics. THE Atypical Stock Market Performance of public firms that issue seasoned eq- uity raises an important challenge for financial theory. Summarizing an exten- sive empirical literature,1 Ritter (2003) reports average stock market returns of 72% in the year prior to a seasoned equity offering (SEO), an announcement effect of −2%, and five-year post-issuance abnormal returns of about −30% relative to seemingly reasonable benchmarks.

    "title": "Corporate Investment and Asset Price Dynamics:",
    "abstract": "We show that corporate investment decisions can explain the conditional dynamics in expected asset returns. Our approach is similar in spirit to Berk, Green, and Naik (1999), but we introduce to the investment problem operating leverage, reversible real options, fixed adjustment costs, and finite growth opportunities. Asset betas vary over time with historical investment decisions and the current product market demand. Book-to-market effects emerge and relate to operating leverage, while size captures the residual importance of growth options relative to assets in place. We estimate and test the model using simulation methods and reproduce portfolio excess returns comparable to the data. Corporate Investment Decisions are often evaluated in a real options context, 1 and option exercise can change the riskiness of a firm in various ways. For example, if growth opportunities are finite, the decision to invest changes the ratio of growth options to assets in place. Additionally, the resulting increase in physical capital may generate operating leverage through long-term obliga- tions, including the fixed operating costs of a larger plant, wage contracts, and commitments to suppliers. It is natural to conclude that expected returns might be related to current and historical investment decisions of the firm. The empirical literature has long recognized a need to account for the dynamic structure of risk when testing asset pricing models. 2 A small but growing literature that endog",

We construct variables that measure the extent of ﬁrm support for candidates. We ﬁnd that these measures are positively and signiﬁcantly correlated with the cross-section of future returns. The effect is strongest for ﬁrms that support a greater number of candidates that hold ofﬁce in the same state that the ﬁrm is based. In addition, there are stronger effects for ﬁrms whose contributions are slanted toward House candidates and Democrats. Despite A Spate OF Recent events concerning lobbyists and other special in- terest groups and their alleged undue inﬂuence on elected ofﬁcials,1 the U.S. Political system is viewed by many as a relatively fair and impartial form of gov- ernment, especially when compared to other governments (Kaufmann, Kraay, and Mastruzzi (2003)).

    "abstract": "This paper extends the theory of non-cash auctions by considering the revenue and suggests using non-cash auctions to increase cash-constrained bidder participa- tion. We examine this proposal and demonstrate that securities may lead to higher revenue. However, bidders pool unless bids include debt, which results in possible repossession by the seller. This suggests all-equity outcomes are unlikely and ex- plains the high debt of reorganized firms. Securities also inefficiently determine bidders' incentive contracts and the firm's capital structure. Therefore, we recom- mend a new cash auction for an incentive contract. Two Important Papers in the legal literature, Baird (1986) and Jackson (1986), suggest that a bankrupt firm's assets should be auctioned off. Their ratio- nale is that a cash auction is an efficient procedure for selling assets and the role of bankruptcy procedures is not to reallocate claims but rather to allow for efficient liquidation.1 Subsequently, in an influential paper, Aghion, Hart, and Moore (1992) (henceforth AHM) call for the replacement of the reorganization process (Chap- ters 7 and 11 in the United States Bankruptcy Code) by a two-stage proce- dure that separates the valuation decision (price of the firm, who should manage it, and with what capital structure) from the allocation decision for old claimants (which security gets what allocation).2 In particular, for the allocation decision, AHM propose a version of a scheme due to Bebchuk (1988).

    "title": "Corporate Scandals and Household Stock Market",
    "abstract": "We show that, after the revelation of corporate fraud in a state, household stock mar- ket participation in that state decreases. Households decrease holdings in fraudulent as well as nonfraudulent ﬁrms, even if they do not hold stocks in fraudulent ﬁrms. Within a state, households with more lifetime experience of corporate fraud hold less equity. Following the exogenous increase in fraud revelation due to Arthur Ander- sen’s demise, states with more Arthur Andersen clients experience a larger decrease in stock market participation. We provide evidence that the documented effect is likely to reﬂect a loss of trust in the stock market. THE Ability TO Reap Equity Returns IS OF Central importance for household welfare and hence is the subject of a growing literature in ﬁnance and economics (Campbell (2006)). A number of inﬂuential papers rely on ﬁxed participation costs and nonstandard preferences and expectations to explain why households do not participate in the stock market to the extent that standard portfolio models would predict (e.g., Mankiw and Zeldes (1991), Poterba and Samwick (1995), Vissing-Jørgensen (2002)).

    "title": "Corporate Taxes and Securitization",
    "abstract": "Most banks pay corporate income taxes, but securitization vehicles do not. Our model shows that, when a bank faces strong loan demand but limited deposit market power, this tax asymmetry creates an incentive to sell loans despite less-efﬁcient screening and monitoring of sold loans. Moreover, loan-selling increases as a bank’s corporate income tax rate and capital requirement rise. Our empirical tests show that U.S. Commercial banks sell more of their mortgages when they operate in states that impose higher corporate income taxes. A policy implication is that tax-induced loan- selling will rise if banks’ required equity capital increases. Prior TO THE 2007 to 2009 ﬁnancial crisis, securitization grew rapidly for sev- eral decades.1 Securitization is a process whereby banks and nonbank lenders sell mortgages or other loans to special purpose vehicles that issue mortgage- or asset-backed securities. Securitization permits a bank to originate loans and then transfer their interest rate and credit risks to mortgage- and asset- backed security investors. A potential beneﬁt to the banking system is reduced exposure to risks that threaten its stability. For example, banks that securitize long-duration ﬁxed-rate mortgages can avoid the extreme interest rate risk that decimated U.S. Thrift institutions during the 1980s. However, the recent revelation of mortgage-backed securities’ poor credit quality has highlighted problems with the securitization process.2 mental side effects. Model",

    "title": "Corporate Yield Spreads and Bond Liquidity",
    "abstract": "We find that liquidity is priced in corporate yield spreads. Using a battery of liquidity measures covering over 4,000 corporate bonds and spanning both investment grade and speculative categories, we find that more illiquid bonds earn higher yield spreads, and an improvement in liquidity causes a significant reduction in yield spreads. These results hold after controlling for common bond-specific, firm-specific, and macroeco- nomic variables, and are robust to issuers’ fixed effect and potential endogeneity bias. Our findings justify the concern in the default risk literature that neither the level nor the dynamic of yield spreads can be fully explained by default risk determinants. A Number OF Recent Studies (Collin-Dufresne, Goldstein, and Martin (2001) and Huang and Huang (2003)) indicate that neither levels nor changes in the yield spread of corporate bonds over Treasury bonds can be fully explained by credit risk determinants proposed by structural form models. Longstaff, Mithal, and Neis (2005) suggest that illiquidity may be a possible explanation for the failure of these models to more properly capture the yield spread variation. Yet much of the current literature abstracts from liquidity’s influence (Elton et al. (2001), focuses on aggregate liquidity proxies (Grinblatt (1995), Duffie and Singleton (1997), Collin-Dufresne et al. (2001), and Campbell and Taksler (2003) or as- sumes that simply the unexplained portion of the yield spread is liquidity based (Duffee (19",

    "title": "Corporate Yield Spreads: Default Risk",
    "abstract": "We use the information in credit default swaps to obtain direct measures of the size of the default and nondefault components in corporate spreads. We find that the majority of the corporate spread is due to default risk. This result holds for all rating categories and is robust to the definition of the riskless curve. We also find that the nondefault component is time varying and strongly related to measures of bond-specific illiquidity as well as to macroeconomic measures of bond market liquidity. HOW DO Financial Markets Value Corporate Debt? What portion of corporate yield spreads is directly attributable to default risk? How much of the spread stems from other factors such as liquidity and taxes? These issues are of fundamental importance from an investment perspective since corporate debt outstanding in the United States now approaches $5 trillion, making it one of the largest asset classes in the financial markets. These issues are also of key importance from a corporate finance perspective because the presence of nondefault components in corporate spreads could directly affect capital structure decisions as well as the timing of debt and equity issuances. A number of articles have studied the determinants of corporate yield spreads.

    "abstract": "Financial intermediation naturally arises when knowing how loan payoffs are corre- lated is valuable for managing investments but lenders cannot easily observe that relationship. I show this result using a costly enforcement model in which lenders need ex post incentives to enforce payments from defaulted loans and borrowers’ pay- offs are correlated. When projects have correlated outcomes, learning the state of one project (via enforcement) provides information about the states of other projects. A large correlated portfolio provides ex post incentives for enforcement. Thus, inter- mediation dominates direct lending, and intermediaries are ﬁnanced with risk-free deposits, earn positive proﬁts, and hold systemic default risk. AS IS Well Known , Banks AND Other ﬁnancial intermediaries frequently hold assets whose risks are correlated and hard to value. Thus, while loans are jointly correlated, either it is unclear how they correlate with easily observable information or that information has low explanatory power. Moreover, banks do not simply pool risk: banks’ balance sheets are risky and banks produce information to efﬁciently monitor investments, yet banks can nonetheless pro- duce safe deposits from their assets. This paper proposes a mechanism that would explain intermediation with this risk exposure. 1 The key contribution of this paper is to show that ﬁnancial intermediation with correlated risks naturally arises when knowing how loan payoffs are correlated is valuable f",

    "abstract": "This paper analyzes the trading behavior of stock market investors. Purchases and sales are highly correlated when we divide investors geographically. Investors who live near a firm’s headquarters react in a similar manner to releases of public information. We are able to make this identification by exploiting a unique feature of individual brokerage accounts in the People’s Republic of China. The data allow us to pinpoint an investor’s location at the time he or she places a trade. Our results are consistent with a simple, rational expectations model of heterogeneously informed investors. Over THE Past Decade, financial economists have become increasingly fascinated with the trading decisions of investors. Does a well-defined subset of investors tend to buy or sell the same securityen masse? What drives this behavior? Are investors choosing their investment strategies by observing the investment decisions of others around them? Are investors driven by some sort of group psychology? Does the presence of a herd mentality affect asset prices? Alternatively, investors might simply be reacting to the dissemination of in- formation. If subgroups of investors react similarly, financial economists would also measure correlated trading behavior. In this alternative view, it is possible that stock prices and trading patterns are jointly determined as equilibrium outcomes.

    "abstract": "A German broker’s clients place similar speculative trades and therefore tend to be on the same side of the market in a given stock during a given day, week, month, and quarter. Aggregate liquidity effects, short sale constraints, the systematic execution of limit orders (coordinated through price movements) or the correlated trading of other investors who pick off retail limit orders do not fully explain why retail investors trade similarly. Correlated market orders lead returns, presumably due to persistent speculative price pressure. Correlated limit orders also predict subsequent returns, consistent with executed limit orders being compensated for accommodating liquidity demands. Across ALL Market Participants , trades net to zero in each stock: There is a buyer for every seller. However, subgroups of investors may be net buyers or sellers in a given stock during a given period.

The clients’ complete daily transaction records, available from February 1998 to May 2000, allow us to address three related questions.

Optimal portfolios include distinct hedging components against both stochastic volatility and correlation risk. We ﬁnd that the hedging demand is typically larger than in univari- ate models, and it includes an economically signiﬁcant covariance hedging compo- nent, which tends to increase with the persistence of variance–covariance shocks, the strength of leverage effects, the dimension of the investment opportunity set, and the presence of portfolio constraints. This Paper Develops A NEW Multivariate Modeling FRAMEWORKfor intertempo- ral portfolio choice under a stochastic variance–covariance matrix. We consider an incomplete market economy, in which stochastic volatilities and stochastic correlations follow a multivariate diffusion process. In this setting, volatili- ties and correlations are conditionally correlated with returns, and optimal portfolio strategies include distinct hedging components against volatility and correlation risk. We solve the optimal portfolio problem and provide simple closed-form solutions that allow us to study the volatility and covariance hedg- ing demands in realistic asset allocation settings.

    "abstract": "We design an experiment to study the implications of information networks for incen- tives to acquire costly information, market liquidity, investors’ earnings, and asset price characteristics in a ﬁnancial market. Social communication crowds out infor- mation production as a result of an agent’s temptation to free ride on the signals purchased by her neighbors. Although information exchange among traders increases trading volume, improves liquidity, and enhances the ability of asset prices to reﬂect the available information in the market, it fails to improve price informativeness. Net earnings and social welfare are higher with information sharing due to reduced acquisition of costly signals. Knowledge About Fundamentals Influences Security prices. The acquisition of such costly information is one of the central topics in economics. A long line investigates the incentives to acquire costly information and its implications for ﬁnancial markets. Using the principle of rational expectations, this literature shows that investors’ diverse information is reﬂected in asset prices and that individuals incorporate the information content of prices into their trading decisions.

    "title": "Countercyclical Income Risk and Portfolio",
    "abstract": "Using Swedish administrative panel data, we document that workers facing higher left-tail income risk when equity markets perform poorly have lower portfolio equity share. In line with theory, the relationship between cyclical skewness and stock hold- ings increases with the share of human capital in a worker’s total wealth and van- ishes as workers get closer to retirement. Cyclical skewness also predicts portfolio differences within pairs of identical twins. Our ﬁndings show that households hedge against correlated tail risks, an important mechanism in asset pricing and portfolio choice models. HOW Does Future Labor Income affect portfolios? One view is that human capital increases the demand for equity because labor income risk is largely uncorrelated with stock returns (Viceira ( 2001), Cocco, Gomes, and Maenhout (2005)). However, this prediction is at odds with the reluctance of young work- ers to buy stocks and makes it more difﬁcult to explain the equity premium. An alternative view is that, although uncorrelated with stock returns, la- bor income risk is countercyclical, in particular, its skewness ﬂuctuates over the business cycle. Life-cycle models with countercyclical risk explain the level and cross section of stock holdings better (Storesletten, Telmer, and Yaron ( 2007), Lynch and Tan ( 2011), Catherine ( 2022)). Countercyclical in- come risk also helps asset pricing models match the level, volatility, and cross section of prices (Constantinides and Dufﬁe ( 1996",

    "title": "Counterparty Risk and the Pricing",
    "abstract": "Motivated by recent financial crises in East Asia and the United States where the downfall of a small number of firms had an economy-wide impact, this paper gen- eralizes existing reduced-form models to include default intensities dependent on the default of a counterparty. In this model, firms have correlated defaults due not only to an exposure to common risk factors, but also to firm-specific risks that are termed \"counterparty risks.\" Numerical examples illustrate the effect of counter- party risk on the pricing of defaultable bonds and credit derivatives such as de- fault swaps. IT HAS Been Well Documented in Moody's reports on historical default rates of corporate bond issuers that the number of defaults, the number of credit rating downgrades, and credit spreads are all strongly correlated with the business cycle. This has motivated reduced-form models such as Duffie and Singleton (1999) and Lando (1994, 1998), which assume that the intensity of default is a stochastic process that derives its randomness from a set of state variables such as the short-term interest rate. This approach has the con- venient features that conditioning on the state variables, defaults become independent events, and default correlation arises due to the common influ- ence of these state variables. On the other hand, a default intensity that depends linearly on a set of smoothly varying macroeconomic variables is unlikely to account for the clustering of defaults around an economic reces- si",

    "abstract": "Differences in real interest rates across developed economies are puzzlingly large and persistent. I propose a simple explanation: bonds issued in the currencies of larger economies are expensive because they insure against shocks that affect a larger fraction of the world economy. I show that, indeed, differences in the size of economies explain a large fraction of the cross-sectional variation in currency returns. The data also support additional implications of the model: the introduction of a currency union lowers interest rates in participating countries, and stocks in the nontraded sector of larger economies pay lower expected returns. International Investors Earn High expected returns by borrowing in low in- terest rate currencies and lending in high interest rate currencies. I propose a simple explanation for this fact: bonds issued in the currencies of economies that account for a larger share of world wealth are a better hedge against consumption risk. As a consequence, larger economies have permanently lower real and nominal interest rates than smaller economies, resulting in persistent violations of uncovered interest parity (UIP). Consider a world in which there are two countries, call them the United States and Denmark (where the United States accounts for most of the world’s wealth). Households in both countries consume a mixture of traded and non- traded goods. In this world, bonds are country-speciﬁc consumption insurance: the U.S. Risk-free bond promises to",

    "title": "Cream-Skimming in Financial Markets",
    "abstract": "We propose a model in which investors may choose to acquire costly information that identiﬁes good assets and purchase these assets in opaque (OTC) markets. Un- informed investors access an asset pool that has been cream-skimmed by informed investors. When the quality composition of assets for sale is ﬁxed, there is too much information acquisition and the ﬁnancial industry extracts excessive rents. In the presence of moral hazard in origination, the social value of information varies in- versely with information acquisition. Low quality origination is associated with large rents in the ﬁnancial sector. Equilibrium acquisition of information is generically inefﬁcient. What Does THE FINANCIALindustry add to the real economy? What is the optimal organization of ﬁnancial markets, and how much talent is required in the ﬁnancial industry? We revisit these fundamental questions in light of recent events and criticisms of the ﬁnancial industry. The core issue underlying these questions is whether the ﬁnancial industry extracts excessively high rents from the provision of ﬁnancial services and whether these rents attract too much talent.1 Figure V , Panel B, from Philippon and Reshef (2012, p. 1569) plots the evolution of U.S. Wages (relative to average nonfarm wages) for three subsegments of the ﬁnancial services industry: credit, insurance, and “other ﬁnance.” “Credit” refers to banks, S&Ls, and similar institutions; “insurance” to life and P&C insurers and “other ﬁnance” to the ﬁn",

    "title": "Credit Contagion from Counterparty Risk",
    "abstract": "Standard credit risk models cannot explain the observed clustering of default, some- times described as “credit contagion.” This paper provides the first empirical analysis of credit contagion via direct counterparty effects. We find that bankruptcy announce- ments cause negative abnormal equity returns and increases in CDS spreads for credi- tors. In addition, creditors with large exposures are more likely to suffer from financial distress later. This suggests that counterparty risk is a potential additional channel of credit contagion. Indeed, the fear of counterparty defaults among financial institu- tions explains the sudden worsening of the credit crisis after the Lehman bankruptcy in September 2008. Recent Years Have Witnessed Technical Advances in portfolio credit risk models, in theory allowing financial institutions to measure the distribution of their potential credit losses at the top level of the institution. Such information can be used to infer economic capital, which is the amount of equity capital the institution should carry to absorb a large loss over a specified horizon with a high level of confidence. These new credit models are in widespread use in the financial industry. For instance, they are employed in the structuring of Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs). 1 These models are also the basis for the recently established regulatory capital charges for commercial banks.2 Calibration of these models, however, is notoriously difficult. This is in large",

    "title": "Credit Rating Inﬂation and Firms’ Investments",
    "abstract": "We analyze credit rating effects on ﬁrm investments in a rational bond ﬁnancing game that features a feedback loop. The credit rating agency (CRA) inﬂates the rat- ing, providing a biased but informative signal to creditors. Creditors’ response to the rating affects the ﬁrm’s investment decision and thus its credit quality , which is re- ﬂected in the rating. The CRA might reduce ex ante economic efﬁciency , which results solely from its strategic effect: the CRA assigns more ﬁrms high ratings and allows them to gamble for resurrection. We derive empirical predictions on the determinants of rating standards and inﬂation and discuss policy implications. Credit Rating Agencies (cras) Have Been criticized for playing a central role in ﬁnancial failures, such as the collapse of Enron and WorldCom in 2002 and the 2007–2009 ﬁnancial crisis that led the Financial Crisis Inquiry Re- port to conclude that “the failures of CRAs were essential cogs in the wheel of ﬁnancial destruction.” Critics claim that CRAs assign overgenerous ratings, and several empirical studies ﬁnd support for this view .1 These studies argue that the documented credit rating inﬂation may be due to conﬂicts of interest arising from the use of an “issuer-pays” business model, whereby CRAs are Xiong (Editor), an anonymous Associate Editor, and two anonymous referees for insightful com- ments and suggestions.

    "title": "Credit Ratings and Capital Structure",
    "abstract": "This paper examines to what extent credit ratings directly affect capital structure de- cisions. The paper outlines discrete costs (benefits) associated with firm credit rating level differences and tests whether concerns for these costs (benefits) directly affect debt and equity financing decisions. Firms near a credit rating upgrade or downgrade issue less debt relative to equity than firms not near a change in rating. This behavior is consistent with discrete costs (benefits) of rating changes but is not explained by traditional capital structure theories. The results persist within previous empirical tests of the pecking order and tradeoff capital structure theories. Managers Appear TO Take Credit Ratings into account when making capital struc- ture decisions. For example, theWall Street Journal(WSJ) (2004) reported that EDS was issuing more than $1 billion in new shares, “hoping to forestall a credit-rating downgrade,” Barron’s (2003) reported that Lear Corp. Reduced its debt because they were “striving to win an investment-grade bond rating above the current BB-plus from Standard & Poor’s,” and the WSJ (2002) reported that Fiat was “racing” to reduce the company’s debt because it was “increasingly wor- ried about a possible downgrade of its credit rating.” More formally, Graham and Harvey (2001) find that credit ratings are the second highest concern for CFOs when determining their capital structure, with 57.1% of CFOs saying that credit ratings were important or very i",

    "abstract": "We examine the role of borrower concerns about future credit availability in mitigating the effects of adverse selection and income misrepresentation in the mortgage market. We show that the majority of additional risk associated with “low-doc” mortgages originated prior to the Great Recession was due to adverse selection on the part of borrowers who could verify income but chose not to. We provide novel evidence that these borrowers were more likely to inﬂate or exaggerate their income. Our analysis suggests that recent regulatory changes that have essentially eliminated the low-doc loan product would result in credit rationing against self-employed borrowers. During THE Great Recession OF 2007 to 2008, the United States experienced a massive increase in residential mortgage defaults and foreclosures not seen since the Great Depression. For example, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Com- mission reports that 9.7% of all mortgages were in default by the end of 2009, compared to approximately 1% at the start of the decade. 1 While the decline in house prices between 2007 and 2009 is obviously one of the primary causes for the signiﬁcant number of mortgage defaults registered during the crisis, ﬁnancial economists have only recently begun to examine the role of mortgage fraud and adverse selection in exacerbating the consequences of the 2007 to 2009 housing bust. Evidence is mounting that the great mortgage expansion that accompanied the rise in home prices coincided with increases",

    "title": "Creditor Control Rights and Board Independence",
    "abstract": "We ﬁnd that the number of independent directors on corporate boards increases by approximately 24% following ﬁnancial covenant violations in credit agreements. Most of these new directors have links to creditors. Firms that appoint new directors after violations are more likely to issue new equity, and to decrease payout, operational risk, and CEO cash compensation, than ﬁrms without such appointments. We conclude that a ﬁrm’s board composition, governance, and policies are shaped by current and past credit agreements. After A Loan Covenant Violation, creditors can use the threat of accelerating loan payments and/or terminating credit agreements to extract concessions from borrowers in exchange for contract renegotiation. In practice, creditors rarely need to carry out such threats; most covenant violations lead to con- tract renegotiation (Roberts (2015)). Covenant violations enhance creditors’ bargaining position in renegotiations, as shown by the empirical literature on the impact of violations on ﬁrm policies (e.g., Chava and Roberts (2008), Roberts and Suﬁ (2009), Nini, Smith, and Suﬁ (2009, 2012), Falato and Liang (2016)).

    "title": "Creditor Rights, Enforcement, and Bank Loans",
    "abstract": "We examine whether differences in legal protection affect the size, maturity, and inter- est rate spread on loans to borrowers in 48 countries. Results show that banks respond to poor enforceability of contracts by reducing loan amounts, shortening loan maturi- ties, and increasing loan spreads. These effects are both statistically significant and economically large. While stronger creditor rights reduce spreads, they do not seem to matter for loan size and maturity. Overall, we show that variation in enforceability of contracts matters a great deal more to how loans are structured and how they are priced. THE Extent TO Which Property Rights are protected in a country is an impor- tant consideration in determining what loans are offered to firms, how these loans are structured, and how they are priced. Property rights protection af- fects a lender’s incentives to monitor and its ability to recontract. Declining credit quality often results in lenders raising interest rates, demanding more collateral, shortening loan maturity, and further restricting future activities. This recontracting is costly when property rights are poorly enforced. Poor en- forcement lowers recovery rates and increases the time spent in repossessing collateral following default. In addition to enforcement, the legal rights that lenders have in reorgani- zation and liquidation procedures are also important. Differences in creditor rights matter to loan contracting because laws determine who controls the",

    "abstract": "We model the optimal resolution of insolvent ﬁrms in general equilibrium. Collateral- constrained banks lend to (i) solvent ﬁrms to ﬁnance investments and (ii) distressed ﬁrms to avoid liquidation. Liquidations create negative ﬁre-sale externalities. Liqui- dations also relieve bank balance–sheet congestion, enabling new ﬁrm loans that gen- erate positive collateral externalities by lowering bank borrowing rates. Socially opti- mal interventions encourage liquidation when ﬁrms have high operating losses, high leverage, or low productivity .

    "abstract": "In practice, heterogeneously informed speculators combine private information about multiple stocks with information in prices, taking into account how their trades in- fluence the inferences of other speculators via prices. We show how this speculation causes prices to be more correlated than asset fundamentals, raising price volatility. The covariance structure of asset fundamentals drives that of prices, while the co- variance structure of liquidity trade drives that of order flows. We characterize how speculator profits vary with the distributions of information and liquidity trade across assets and speculators, and relate the cross-asset factor structure of order flows to that of returns. Stock Markets ARE Characterized by many stocks and many traders. Specula- tors, especially institutional traders, often interact strategically in many stocks simultaneously. When asset values are correlated, private information about one stock may well provide a speculator information about other stocks that he will incorporate in his trading. For example, a speculator with private informa- tion about a new drug from Merck that affects the value of Glaxo Smith Kline may trade both stocks. But strategic interactions are far richer than just this observation suggests. In practice, speculators also observe prices and use that information when trad- ing. Concretely, traders may use information in the price of Glaxo to adjust trades of Merck. Speculators also understand that their trades con",

    "abstract": "We examine the contribution of cross-listings to price discovery for a sample of Canadian stocks listed on both the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE) and a U.S. Exchange. We find that prices on the TSE and U.S. Exchange are cointe- grated and mutually adjusting. The U.S. Share of price discovery ranges from 0.2 percent to 98.2 percent, with an average of 38.1 percent. The U.S. Share is directly related to the U.S. Share of trading and to the ratio of proportions of informative trades on the U.S. Exchange and the TSE, and inversely related to the ratio of bid-ask spreads. With THE Enhanced Globalization of financial markets, the number of non-U.S. Firms cross-listing shares on a U.S. Exchange has substantially increased. At- tracting non-U.S. Listings is now a top priority of the U.S. Stock exchanges. At the end of 2000, 420 non-U.S. Firms were listed on the New York Stock Exchange (nyse). The number of foreign firms listed on Nasdaq was even higher. The popu- larity of international cross-listings has prompted many academic studies on the topic.1 Most of these studies focus on the benefits of international cross-listings, including the reduced cost of capital and the enhanced liquidity of a firm's stock. Studies such as Alexander, Eun, and Janakiramanan (1987,1988) and Foerster and Karolyi (1993) suggest that the cost of capital declines because the portion of the risk premium that compensates for cross-border investment barriers dissi- pates.

    "abstract": "This paper studies the interaction between dealer markets and a relatively new form of exchange, passive crossing networks, where buyers and sellers trade di- rectly with one another. We find that the crossing network is characterized by both positive (\"liquidity\") and negative (\"crowding\") externalities, and we analyze the effects of its introduction on the dealer market. Traders who use the dealer market as a \"market of last resort\" can induce dealers to widen their spread and can lead to more efficient subsequent prices, but traders who only use the crossing network can provide a counterbalancing effect by reducing adverse selection and inventory holding costs. Competition Between Exchanges for order flow is a growing phenomenon in financial markets. From London to Paris to Tel Aviv, exchanges and trad- ing systems are introducing new trading mechanisms that compete for or- der flow. In the United States, the SEC promulgated new rules that redefine the regulation of Alternative Trading Systems and intensify the competi- tion between existing exchanges and new electronic markets. Indeed, new electronic trading venues are cited as the reason for a decline in the value of seats on major exchanges, even though trading volumes are growing rapidly. What will be the impact of new trading mechanisms on market partici- pants and on existing dealer markets (DMs)?

    "title": "Currency Orders and Exchange Rate Dynamics: An",
    "abstract": "This paper documents clustering in currency stop-loss and take-profit orders, and uses that clustering to provide an explanation for two familiar predic- tions from technical analysis: (1) trends tend to reverse course at predictable support and resistance levels, and (2) trends tend to be unusually rapid after rates cross such levels. The data are the first available on individual currency stop-loss and take-profit orders. Take-profit orders cluster particularly strongly at round numbers, which could explain the first prediction. Stop-loss orders cluster strongly just beyond round numbers, which could explain the second prediction. Technical analysis is useful for predicting short-run exchange rate dynamics. This is true for a wide variety of technical trading tools, including visual pat- terns, trend identification formulas, trend reversal signals, and genetic algo- rithms.1 The one potential explanation for this phenomenon familiar to exchange-rate economists- central bank intervention--does not survive rigor- ous scrutiny (Neely (2000) and Osler (2002)). The ability of some technical meth- ods to predict high-frequency exchange rate movements contrasts with the predictive difficulties of structural exchange-rate models. Beginning with Meese and Rogoff (1983), researchers have consistently found that structural models fail to outperform random walk models at predicting short-run exchange rate move- ments out of sample (Frankel and Rose (1995), Faust, Rogers and Wright (200",

    "title": "Currency Returns, Intrinsic Value,",
    "abstract": "We decompose currency returns into (permanent) intrinsic-value shocks and (tran- sitory) expected-return shocks. We explore interactions between these shocks, cur- rency returns, and institutional-investor currency flows. Intrinsic-value shocks are: dwarfed by expected-return shocks (yet currency returns overreact to them); unrelated to flows (although expected-return shocks correlate with flows); and related positively to forecasted cumulated-interest differentials. These results suggest flows are related to short-term currency returns, while fundamentals better explain long-term returns and values. They also rationalize the long-observed poor performance of exchange-rate models: by ignoring the distinction between permanent and transitory exchange-rate changes, prior tests obscure the connection between currencies and fundamentals. What Drives Exchange -rate Values?i ti sa nage-old question, with a heritage of rich modeling and important theoretical insights. There has been frustration with the data, however, which generally have not held up their part of the bargain. A generation after Meese and Rogoff (1983), traditional exchange- rate fundamentals specified by theory continue to forecast more poorly than a random walk. There are some important exceptions—such as the evidence at long horizons presented by Mark (1995)—but by and large there remains no well-accepted “traditional” model of exchange-rate determination. This frustration has led to a search for alternatives tha",

    "abstract": "Focusing on the 10 most traded currencies, we provide empirical evidence regarding a signiﬁcant heterogeneous exposure to global growth news shocks. We incorporate this empirical fact in a frictionless risk-sharing model with recursive preferences, multiple countries, and multiple consumption goods whose supply features both global and local short- and long-run shocks. Since news shocks are priced, heterogeneous exposure to long-lasting global growth shocks results in a relevant reallocation of international resources and currency adjustments. Our uniﬁed framework replicates the properties of the Hml-fx and Hml-nfa carry-trade strategies studied by Lustig, Roussanov, and Verdelhan and Della Corte, Riddiough, and Sarno. A Growing Empirical Literature INinternational ﬁnance examines the struc- ture of risk in the cross section of currency returns (see, among others, Lustig and Verdelhan (2007), Lustig, Roussanov, and Verdelhan (2014), Della Corte, Riddiough, and Sarno (2016)). These studies sort currencies on various criteria and highlight the empirical relevance of several economic and ﬁnancial factors. In this paper, we provide novel empirical evidence in support of a structural dynamic equilibrium model that can account for these factor structures in the context of a news shocks–based asset-pricing model.

    "title": "Dealer Networks",
    "abstract": "Dealers in the over-the-counter municipal bond market form trading networks with other dealers to mitigate search frictions. Regulatory data show that this network has a core-periphery structure with 10 to 30 hubs and over 2,000 peripheral broker- dealers in which bonds ﬂow from periphery to core and partially back. Central dealers charge investors up to double the round-trip markups compared to peripheral dealers. In turn, central dealers provide immediacy by matching buyers with sellers more directly and prearranging fewer trades, especially during stress times. Investors thus face a trade-off between execution cost and speed, consistent with network models of decentralized trade. Dealers Play A Pivotal Role in price formation and liquidity in over-the- counter (OTC) ﬁnancial markets. In frictionless markets, buyers and sellers ﬁnd each other immediately and realize gains from trade at competitive prices. This is not the case, however, in decentralized markets. In particular, the opaque nature of bilateral OTC transactions creates frictions in ﬁnding coun- terparties that can reduce price and allocation efﬁciency (Dufﬁe, G ˆarleanu, and Pedersen ( 2005)). To address these search and matching frictions, broker- dealers match buyers with sellers not only among their own clients, but also warehouse securities and form trading networks with other dealers. The trad- ing networks allow the dealers to ﬁnd counterparties more quickly and real- locate securities more efﬁciently. Giv",

    "title": "Debt Dynamics",
    "abstract": "We develop a dynamic trade-off model with endogenous choice of leverage, distri- butions, and real investment in the presence of a graduated corporate income tax, individual taxes on interest and corporate distributions, financial distress costs, and equity flotation costs. We explain several empirical findings inconsistent with the static trade-off theory. We show there is no target leverage ratio, firms can be savers or heavily levered, leverage is path dependent, leverage is decreasing in lagged liq- uidity, and leverage varies negatively with an external finance weighted average Q. Using estimates of structural parameters, we find that simulated model moments match data moments. THE Miller (1977) Perpetual TAX Shield Formula has served as one of the major references for those evaluating whether taxes can explain observed financing patterns. This formula is a cornerstone of the static trade-off theory, which posits that firms weigh the tax benefits of debt against costs associated with fi- nancial distress and bankruptcy. This benchmark model has provided intuition and guidance for much of the empirical literature on corporate capital struc- ture, which has uncovered several patterns in the data that are inconsistent with the static trade-off theory. For example, Graham (2000) finds that, “Paradoxically, large, liquid, prof- itable firms with low expected distress costs use debt conservatively.” By debt “conservatism,” Graham means that firms fail to issue sufficient debt",

    "abstract": "We test the implications of Flannery’s (1986) and Diamond’s (1991) models concerning the effects of risk and asymmetric information in determining debt maturity, and we examine the overall importance of informational asymmetries in debt maturity choices. We employ data on over 6,000 commercial loans from 53 large U.S. Banks. Our results for low-risk firms are consistent with the predictions of both theoretical models, but our findings for high-risk firms conflict with the predictions of Diamond’s model and with much of the empirical literature. Our findings also suggest a strong quantitative role for asymmetric information in explaining debt maturity. WHY DO Firms With Long -term Projects often borrow on a short-term basis? One answer from the debt maturity literature emphasizes the importance of risk under conditions of asymmetric information. Flannery (1986), Diamond (1991), and others provide intuitive models that rely on low-risk and high-risk firms with long-term projects choosing different maturities to reduce their financing costs or liquidity risks. Although other theories of debt maturity focus on the roles of agency costs (e.g., Myers (1977), Barnea, Haugen, and Senbet (1980)), taxes (e.g., Brick and Ravid (1985), Lewis (1990)), and other market imperfec- tions, we concentrate on the role of asymmetric information and how it interacts with firm risk.

    "abstract": "This paper presents empirical evidence that the maturity structure of ﬁnancial lever- age affects the cross-section of equity returns. We ﬁnd that short-term leverage is associated with a positive premium, whereas long-term leverage is not. The premium for short-term compared to long-term leverage reﬂects higher exposure of equity to systematic risk. To rationalize our ﬁndings, we show that the same patterns emerge in a model of debt rollover risk with endogenous leverage and debt maturity choice. Our results suggest that analyses of leverage effects in asset prices and corporate ﬁnancial applications should account for the maturity structure of debt. Financial Leverage Plays A Central role in corporate ﬁnance and as- set pricing. In this paper, we empirically revisit the cross-sectional relation between market leverage and equity returns from a novel perspective.

    "title": "Debt Specialization",
    "abstract": "This paper examines debt structure using a new and comprehensive database on types of debt employed by public U.S. ﬁrms. We ﬁnd that 85% of the sample ﬁrms borrow predominantly with one type of debt, and the degree of debt specialization varies widely across different subsamples—large rated ﬁrms tend to diversify across multiple debt types, while small unrated ﬁrms specialize in fewer types. We suggest several explanations for why debt specialization takes place, and show that ﬁrms employing few types of debt have higher bankruptcy costs, are more opaque, and lack access to some segments of the debt markets. Much Attention HAS BEENdevoted to the questions of why ﬁrms choose to issue debt over equity, and how optimal capital structure is designed to minimize a ﬁrm’s cost of ﬁnancing (see Graham and Leary (2011) for a survey of the voluminous literature on capital structure). In this paper, we focus on a related but much less studied topic in corporate ﬁnance, namely, debt structure. Our goals are to explore the types of debt commonly employed by publicly listed U.S. ﬁrms, and to understand why some ﬁrms tend to use relatively few debt types while others display a more diversiﬁed debt structure. To our knowledge, our paper is one of the ﬁrst to provide large sample evidence on ﬁrms’ debt structure. ∗Paolo Colla is at Universit`a Bocconi; Filippo Ippolito is at Universitat Pompeu Fabra; and Kai Cam Harvey (Editor), Miguel Ferreira, Mark Flannery, Emilia Garcia, Vidhan Goyal, Rob",

    "title": "Decentralization through Tokenization",
    "abstract": "We examine decentralization of digital platforms through tokenization as an in- novation to resolve the conﬂict between platforms and users. By delegating con- trol to users, tokenization through utility tokens acts as a commitment de- vice that prevents a platform from exploiting users. This commitment comes at the cost of not having an owner with an equity stake who, in conven- tional platforms, would subsidize participation to maximize the platform’s network effect. This trade-off makes utility tokens a more appealing funding scheme than eq- uity for platforms with weak fundamentals. The conﬂict reappears when nonusers, such as token investors and validators, participate on the platform. THE Proliferation OF THE Digital economy and the recent rise of the ﬁn- tech industry have led to two important trends. First, a sizable number of dig- ital platforms have funded their development and operations through the is- suance of cryptocurrencies or tokens. For instance, according to Allen, Gu, and Jagtiani (2020), 4,136 cryptocurrencies existed as of May 2020. This ﬁgure does not include the many cryptocurrencies that have failed. Although rampant speculation and volatility are often observed in this asset class, its growing popularity raises important questions about the beneﬁts and costs associated with the tokenization process. Second, there is a growing tension between dig- ital platforms and their users as online platforms such as Amazon, Google, and Facebook become increasin",

    "abstract": "Using a unique data set, we document two secular trends in the shift from centralized to decentralized pension fund management over the past few decades. First, across asset classes, sponsors replace generalist balanced managers with better-performing specialists. Second, within asset classes, funds replace single managers with multi- ple competing managers following diverse strategies to reduce scale diseconomies as funds grow larger relative to capital markets. Consistent with a model of decentral- ized management, sponsors implement risk controls that trade off higher anticipated alphas of multiple specialists against the increased difﬁculty in coordinating their risk-taking and the greater uncertainty concerning their true skills.

    "abstract": "This paper presents direct measures of capital costs, equal to the product of the re- quired rate of return on capital and the value of the capital stock. The capital share, equal to the ratio of capital costs and gross value added, does not offset the decline in the labor share. Instead, a large increase in the share of pure proﬁts offsets de- clines in the shares of both labor and capital. Industry data show that increases in concentration are associated with declines in the labor share. Since THE Early 1980SW EH A V Ewitnessed a large decline in the labor share of gross value added (Elsby , Hobijn, and ¸Sahin (2013), Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014)). Many existing explanations for the decline in the labor share, such as technological change, mechanization, capital accumulation, and a change in the relative price of capital, focus on tradeoffs between labor and physical capital. These explanations argue that ﬁrms have substituted expenditures on labor inputs into production with expenditures on physical capital inputs into production and each of these explanations offers a different rationale for this substitution. In this paper, I show that the shares of both labor and capital are declining and are jointly offset by a large increase in the share of pure proﬁts.

    "abstract": "We explore how compensation policies following mergers affect a CEO’s incentives to pursue a merger. We find that even in mergers where bidding shareholders are worse off, bidding CEOs are better off three quarters of the time. Following a merger, a CEO’s pay and overall wealth become insensitive to negative stock performance, but a CEO’s wealth rises in step with positive stock performance. Corporate governance matters; bidding firms with stronger boards retain the sensitivity of their CEOs’ compensation to poor performance following the merger. In comparison, we find that CEOs are not rewarded for undertaking major capital expenditures. THE Separation OF Ownership AND Control leads to many potential conflicts of interest between shareholders and corporate management. Since Jensen and Meckling (1976), the literature has focused much attention on how managerial ownership and compensation design can be used to align manager and share- holder interests. The bulk of the empirical evidence supports the hypothesis that managers with greater ownership or managers with more equity-based incentives are less likely to take value-destroying actions. Partly as a consequence of this finding, the 1990s witnessed explosive growth in the grants of equity-based incentives (option and restricted stock grants) to corporate managers (Murphy (1999)). This raises the possibility that the value of a manager’s annual flow of new grants is of the same order of magnitude as an anonymous referee; Qian",

    "abstract": "This is the first study that uses Merton’s (1974) option pricing model to compute default measures for individual firms and assess the effect of default risk on equity returns. The size effect is a default effect, and this is also largely true for the book- to-market (BM) effect. Both exist only in segments of the market with high default risk. Default risk is systematic risk. The Fama–French (FF) factors SMB and HML contain some default-related information, but this is not the main reason that the FF model can explain the cross section of equity returns. A Firm Defaults When IT Fails to service its debt obligations. Therefore, default risk induces lenders to require from borrowers a spread over the risk-free rate of interest. This spread is an increasing function of the probability of default of the individual firm. Risk for the purpose of valuing corporate debt and derivative products written on it, little attention has been paid to the effects of default risk on equity returns. The effect that default risk may have on equity returns is not obvious, since equity holders are the residual claimants on a firm’s cash flows and there is no promised nominal return in equities. Previous studies that examine the effect of default risk on equities focus on the ability of the default spread to explain or predict returns. The default spread is usually defined as the yield or return differential between long-term BAA corporate bonds and long-term AAA or U.S. Treasury bonds. 2 However,",

    "abstract": "This paper explores the nature of default arrival and recovery implicit in the term structures of sovereign CDS spreads. We argue that term structures of spreads re- veal not only the arrival rates of credit events (λ Q), but also the loss rates given credit events. Applying our framework to Mexico, Turkey, and Korea, we show that a single-factor model with λ Q following a lognormal process captures most of the variation in the term structures of spreads. The risk premiums associated with un- predictable variation inλ Q are found to be economically significant and co-vary impor- tantly with several economic measures of global event risk, financial market volatility, and macroeconomic policy. THE Burgeoning Market FOR Sovereign Credit Default Swaps (CDS) contracts of- fers a nearly unique window for viewing investors’ risk-neutral probabilities of major credit events impinging on sovereign issuers, and their risk-neutral losses of principal in the event of a restructuring or repudiation of external debts. In contrast to many “emerging market” sovereign bonds, sovereignCDS contracts are designed without complex guarantees or embedded options. Trad- ing activity in the CDS contracts of several sovereign issuers has developed to the point that they are more liquid than many of the underlying bonds. Moreover, in contrast to the corporate CDS market, where trading has been concentrated largely in the 5-year maturity contract, CDS contracts at several maturity points between 1 and 1",

    "title": "Delegated Portfolio Management and Rational",
    "abstract": "This paper examines how information becomes reflected in prices when in- vestment decisions are delegated to fund managers whose tenure may be shorter than the time it takes for their private information to become public. We consider a sequence of managers, where each subsequent manager inherits the portfolio of their predecessor. We show that the inherited portfolio distorts the subsequent manager's incentive to trade on long-term information. This allows erroneous past information to persist, causing mispricing similar to a bubble. We investigate the magnitude of the mispricing. In addition, we exam- ine endogenous information quality. In some cases, information quality in- creases when the manager's expected tenure decreases. More Than Ever Before, investors delegate the management of their investment portfolios to professional fund managers.1 Due to mobility and turnover, the ex- pected tenure of a manager may be shorter than the investment horizon of a typi- cal investor.2 Given this horizon mismatch, fund managers may have less incentive to collect and trade on long-term information than do the investors they trade for. As a result, the prices in markets with more delegated investment will reflect less long-term information than those markets where long-lived investors manage their own portfolios. The amount of long-term information that is re- flected in prices is likely also to change with market conditions. As a manager's We gratefully acknowledge the helpful comment",

    "title": "Demand–Deposit Contracts and the Probability",
    "abstract": "Diamond and Dybvig (1983) show that while demand–deposit contracts let banks provide liquidity, they expose them to panic-based bank runs. However, their model does not provide tools to derive the probability of the bank-run equilibrium, and thus cannot determine whether banks increase welfare overall. We study a modi- fied model in which the fundamentals determine which equilibrium occurs. This lets us compute the ex ante probability of panic-based bank runs and relate it to the con- tract. We find conditions under which banks increase welfare overall and construct a demand–deposit contract that trades off the benefits from liquidity against the costs of runs. ONE OF THE Most Important Roles Performed BY banks is the creation of liquid claims on illiquid assets. This is often done by offering demand–deposit con- tracts. Such contracts give investors who might have early liquidity needs the option to withdraw their deposits, and thereby enable them to participate in profitable long-term investments. Since each bank deals with many investors, it can respond to their idiosyncratic liquidity shocks and thereby provide liquidity insurance. The advantage of demand–deposit contracts is accompanied by a considerable drawback: The maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities makes banks inherently unstable by exposing them to the possibility of panic-based bank runs. Such runs occur when investors rush to withdraw their deposits, believing that other depositors are going to do so",

    "abstract": "We study the intraday impact of exchange rate news on emerging market Ameri- can Depositary Receipts (ADRs) and closed-end country funds during the 1994 Mexican peso crisis. Peso exchange-rate changes affect prices and trading volumes of Latin American equities, and some closed-end fund behavior is consistent with \"noise trader\" theories of small investors. However, there is no evidence that peso depreciation triggers a significant sell-off of non-Mexican securities or that other non-Mexican trading patterns change at times of high peso news flow. Thus, the \"Tequila Effect\" is largely confined to price changes. THE Recent Economic Crises in Mexico, Asia, Russia, and Brazil demonstrate that currency devaluation can be associated with severe downturns in equity markets. In the case of Mexico, the value of the currency declined from 3.4 pesos per dollar at the end of September 1994 to almost 7 pesos per dollar at the end of March 1995. A stock price drop from $63 to $28 over the same period for Telefonos de Mexico typifies the behavior of Mexican equities. The depreciation of the Mexican peso was also thought to trigger price declines in other Latin American stock, currency, and sovereign debt markets, a phe- nomenon known as \"spillover,\" \"contagion,\" or the \"Tequila Effect.\" Shares of Telefonica de Argentina, for example, dropped from $35 to $24 during the same period.

    "abstract": "We obtain daily data for warrants traded on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange be- tween 1909 and 1922, and for a broker’s call option quotes on stocks from 1908 to 1911. We use this new data set to test how close derivative prices are to Black–Scholes (1973) prices and to compute profits for investors using a simple trading rule for call options. We examine whether investors exercised warrants optimally and how they reacted to extensions of the warrants’ durations. We show that long before the development of the formal theory, investors had an intuitive grasp of the determinants of derivative pricing. WE Obtain Daily Prices FOR Market -traded Warrants on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) from 1909 to 1922 and utilizing the Black–Scholes (1973) model assess whether the market prices of these warrants were “fairly” priced. We compile daily prices of 15 warrant price series from 1909 to 1922 and a broker’s daily call option quotes written on 112 companies’ stocks between January 1908 and May 1911. We test whether the market prices of these derivatives are close to Black–Scholes model prices and also calculate the profits for investors who follow the simple trading strategy of buying one of every call option offered for sale by the broker. We then compare the early twentieth century data with contemporary JSE and U.S. Security market data. Tests of how close the market prices of derivative securities are to fair prices can be grouped into three categories. The first category en",

    "title": "Derivative Pricing with Liquidity Risk: Theory",
    "abstract": "We derive an equilibrium asset pricing model incorporating liquidity risk, derivatives, and short-selling due to hedging of nontraded risk. We show that illiquid assets can have lower expected returns if the short-sellers have more wealth, lower risk aversion, or shorter horizon. The pricing of liquidity risk is different for derivatives than for positive-net-supply assets, and depends on investors’ net nontraded risk exposure. We estimate this model for the credit default swap market. We ﬁnd strong evidence for an expected liquidity premium earned by the credit protection seller. The effect of liquidity risk is signiﬁcant but economically small. THE Relation Between Liquidity and asset prices has received considerable attention recently. It is often thought that illiquid assets always trade at dis- counted prices. In this paper we show that short-selling dramatically changes the effect of liquidity on asset prices. In particular, illiquid assets can trade at higher prices than liquid assets. Short-selling is relevant in many markets. For example, it is of crucial importance when analyzing derivative markets since derivatives are in zero net supply, but short-selling can also be present in markets with positive net supply for example due to hedging pressures. We derive new and testable implications for the pricing of liquidity and test these empirically for one of the key derivative markets, the credit default swap market.

    "title": "Designing Stress Scenarios",
    "abstract": "We study the optimal design of stress scenarios. A principal manages the unknown risk exposures of agents by asking them to report losses under hypothetical scenarios before taking remedial actions. We apply a Kalman ﬁlter to solve the learning prob- lem, and we relate the optimal design to the risk environment, the principal’s pref- erences, and available interventions. In a banking context, optimal capital require- ments cover losses under an adverse scenario, while targeted interventions depend on covariances among residual exposures and systematic risks. Our calibration re- veals that information is particularly valuable for targeted interventions as opposed to broad capital requirements. Stress Tests ARE Ubiquitous IN risk management and ﬁnancial supervi- sion. Risk ofﬁcers use stress tests to set and monitor risk limits within their organizations, and ﬁnancial regulators use stress tests to assess the health of ﬁnancial institutions. For example, ﬁnancial ﬁrms use stress tests to comple- ment their statistical risk management tools (e.g., Value at Risk), asset man- agers stress test their portfolios, trading venues stress test their counterparty exposures, and regulators mandate large-scale stress tests for banks and in- surance companies and use the results to enforce capital requirements and validate dividend policies.1 Nber.

    "abstract": "The vast majority of cross-border mergers involve private ﬁrms outside of the United States. We analyze a sample of 56,978 cross-border mergers between 1990 and 2007. We ﬁnd that geography, the quality of accounting disclosure, and bilateral trade increase the likelihood of mergers between two countries. Valuation appears to play a role in motivating mergers: ﬁrms in countries whose stock market has increased in value, whose currency has recently appreciated, and that have a relatively high market-to-book value tend to be purchasers, while ﬁrms from weaker-performing economies tend to be targets. THE Volume OF Cross-border acquisitions has been growing worldwide, from 23% of total merger volume in 1998 to 45% in 2007. Conceptually, cross-border mergers occur for the same reasons as domestic ones: two ﬁrms will merge when their combination increases value (or utility) from the perception of the acquiring ﬁrm’s managers. However, national borders add an extra ele- ment to the calculus of domestic mergers because they are associated with an additional set of frictions that can impede or facilitate mergers. For exam- ple, cultural or geographic differences can increase the costs of combining two ﬁrms. Governance-related differences across countries can motivate a merger if the combined ﬁrm has better protection for target-ﬁrm shareholders because of higher governance standards in the country of the acquiring ﬁrm. Perhaps more importantly, imperfect integration of capital markets",

    "title": "Determinants of Vertical Integration: Financial",
    "abstract": "We study the determinants of vertical integration in a new data set of over 750,000 firms from 93 countries. We present a number of theoretical predictions on the inter- actions between financial development, contracting costs, and the extent of vertical integration. Consistent with these predictions, contracting costs and financial devel- opment by themselves appear to have no effect on vertical integration. However, we find greater vertical integration in countries that have both greater contracting costs and greater financial development. We also show that countries with greater contract- ing costs are more vertically integrated in more capital-intensive industries. Casual Empiricism Suggests THE Presence OF Significant differences in the orga- nization of production across countries. For example, firms are often thought to be larger and more vertically integrated in less developed countries. Khanna and Palepu (1997, 2000) provide evidence consistent with this view and suggest that this is because market and contractual relationships are more costly in less developed countries. Nevertheless, there has not been a systematic analysis of cross-country differences in vertical integration and their causes. Our primary aim in this paper is to make a first attempt at such a systematic analysis and to investigate the relationship between important institutional characteristics and vertical integration across countries. Two well-established theories offer predictions on how differe",

    "title": "Deviations from Covered Interest Rate Parity",
    "abstract": "We ﬁnd that deviations from the covered interest rate parity (CIP) condition imply large, persistent, and systematic arbitrage opportunities in one of the largest asset markets in the world. Contrary to the common view, these deviations for major curren- cies are not explained away by credit risk or transaction costs. They are particularly strong for forward contracts that appear on banks’ balance sheets at the end of the quarter, pointing to a causal effect of banking regulation on asset prices. The CIP deviations also appear signiﬁcantly correlated with other ﬁxed income spreads and with nominal interest rates. THE Foreign Exchange (FX) Forward AND swap market is one of the largest and most liquid derivative markets in the world, with a total notional amount outstanding equal to $61 trillion and average daily turnover equal to $3 trillion (Bank of International Settlements (2013, 2014)). The cornerstone of currency forward and swap pricing, presented in all economics and ﬁnance textbooks and taught in every class in international ﬁnance, is the covered interest rate parity (CIP) condition. In this paper, we document deviations from the CIP in the postcrisis period and investigate the causes of such deviations. ∗Wenxin Du is with the Federal Reserve Board.

    "abstract": "Participants in deﬁned contribution (DC) retirement plans rarely adjust their portfolio allocations, suggesting that their investment choices and consequent money ﬂows are sticky and not discerning. However, participants’ inertia could be offset by DC plan sponsors, who adjust the plan’s investment options. We examine these countervailing inﬂuences on ﬂows into U.S. Mutual funds. We ﬁnd that ﬂows into funds from DC assets are more volatile and exhibit more performance sensitivity than non-DC ﬂows, primarily due to adjustments to the investment options by the plan sponsors. Thus, DC retirement money is less sticky and more discerning than non-DC money. Mutual Fund HOLDINGSin employer-sponsored deﬁned contribution (DC) plans are an important and growing segment of today’s ﬁnancial markets. Assets in DC plans increased from $1.7 trillion in 1995 to $5.9 trillion in 2013.

    "title": "Diagnostic Expectations and Credit Cycles",
    "abstract": "We present a model of credit cycles arising from diagnostic expectations—a belief for- mation mechanism based on Kahneman and Tversky’s representativeness heuristic. Diagnostic expectations overweight future outcomes that become more likely in light of incoming data. The expectations formation rule is forward looking and depends on the underlying stochastic process, and thus is immune to the Lucas critique. Diagnos- tic expectations reconcile extrapolation and neglect of risk in a uniﬁed framework. In our model, credit spreads are excessively volatile, overreact to news, and are subject to predictable reversals. These dynamics can account for several features of credit cycles and macroeconomic volatility. THE Financial Crisis OF 2008 TO 2009 Revived Interest among economists and policy makers in the relationship between credit expansion and subsequent ﬁ- nancial and economic busts. According to an old argument (e.g., Minsky ( 1977)), investor optimism brings about the expansion of credit and investment, and leads to a crisis when such optimism abates. Stein ( 2014) echoes this view by arguing that policy makers should be mindful of credit market frothiness and consider countering it with policy. In this paper, we develop a behavioral model of credit cycles with microfounded expectations that is consistent both with the Minsky narrative and with a great deal of evidence.

    "abstract": "We revisit La Porta’s ﬁnding that returns on stocks with the most optimistic ana- lyst long-term earnings growth forecasts are lower than those on stocks with the most pessimistic forecasts. We document the joint dynamics of fundamentals, expec- tations, and returns of these portfolios, and explain the facts using a model of belief formation based on the representativeness heuristic. Analysts forecast fundamentals from observed earnings growth, but overreact to news by exaggerating the probability of states that have become more likely. We ﬁnd support for the model’s predictions. A quantitative estimation of the model accounts for the key patterns in the data. LA Porta (1996) Shows That Stock market analysts’ expectations of the long- term earnings growth of the companies they cover have strong predictive power for these companies’ future stock returns. Companies whose earnings growth analysts are most optimistic about earn poor returns relative to companies whose analysts are most pessimistic about. Betting against extreme analyst optimism has thus been a good idea on average. La Porta ( 1996) interprets this ﬁnding as evidence that analysts, as well as investors who follow them or think like them, are too optimistic about stocks with rapidly growing earnings and too pessimistic about stocks with deteriorating earnings. As a result, the former stocks are overvalued, the latter are undervalued, and the predictability of returns is driven by the correction of expectations. In",

    "abstract": "In a bad state of the world but repaid them in a relatively good state. We show that the recipients paid considerably lower returns to taxpayers compared to private-market securities with similar risk over the same investment horizon, resulting in a subsidy of over $50 billion on the preferred equity investment by the government. Ex-post renegotiation of contract terms limited the upside gains received by taxpayers in good times and contributed to the subsidy. These ﬁndings have important implications for the design and implementation of future bailouts. Our simple methodology for calculating the subsidy can be applied to evaluate the ﬁnancial costs of other bailouts. Banking Crises ARE Fairly Common around the world. For instance, Laeven and Valencia (2008) identify 124 episodes of systemic banking crises across the world from 1970 to 2007. Laeven and Valencia (2008) further show that governments frequently respond to these crises by providing ﬁnancial support, including the injection of fresh capital into the banking sector. More recently, multiple bank failures in 2023 were followed by the expansion of deposit insurance to cover private-sector losses. These stylized observations further underscore the importance of quantifying the economic costs of gov- ernment interventions. In particular, how large a subsidy, if any, do banks receive through these interventions, and how does the implementation of these interventions affect the extent of the subsidy?

    "abstract": "The leveraged buyout (LBO) boom of 2004 to 2007 was fueled by growth in collat- eralized debt obligations (CDOs) and other forms of securitization. Banks active in structured credit underwriting lent more for LBOs, indicating that bank lending poli- cies linked LBO and CDO markets. LBO loans originated by large CDO underwriters were associated with lower spreads, weaker covenants, and greater use of bank debt in deal ﬁnancing. Loans ﬁnanced through structured credit markets did not lead to worse LBOs, overpayment, or riskier deal structures. Securitization markets altered banks’ access to capital, affected their lending policies, and fueled the recent LBO boom. From 2004 TO 2007, $535 billion of leveraged buyouts (LBOs) were completed, more than 10 times the $50 billion of volume over the previous 8 years from 1996 to 2003 (see Figure 1), vastly eclipsing the $227 billion (in 2007 dollars) of volume during the prior 1986 to 1989 LBO boom. The LBO boom of 2004 to 2007 collapsed as dramatically as it rose, with LBO volume dropping by 94% in the fourth quarter of 2007 from the prior-year level. Most explanations for LBOs are based on trade-off theories of capital struc- ture whereby LBOs create value from interest tax shields, lower agency costs, and operational improvements. While variation in these beneﬁts may have contributed to the large changes in LBO volumes, the 2004 to 2007 LBO boom also coincided with important developments in structured credit markets that potentially",

    "abstract": "We provide evidence that stocks with higher dispersion in analysts' earnings fore- casts earn lower future returns than otherwise similar stocks. This effect is most pronounced in small stocks and stocks that have performed poorly over the past year. Interpreting dispersion in analysts' forecasts as a proxy for differences in opinion about a stock, we show that this evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that prices will reflect the optimistic view whenever investors with the lowest valuations do not trade. By contrast, our evidence is inconsistent with a view that dispersion in analysts' forecasts proxies for risk. IN This Paper WE Analyze THE Role of dispersion in analysts' earnings forecasts in predicting the cross section of future stock returns. We find that stocks with higher dispersion in analysts' earnings forecasts earn significantly lower future returns than otherwise similar stocks. In particular, a portfolio of stocks in the highest quintile of dispersion underperforms a portfolio of stocks in the lowest quintile of dispersion by 9.48 percent per year. This effect is strongest in small stocks, and stocks that have performed poorly over the past year. Our results are robust to various risk-adjustment techniques, and are inconsistent with an interpretation of dispersion in analysts' forecasts as a proxy for risk. We postulate that dispersion in analysts' earnings forecasts can be viewed as a proxy for differences of opinion among investors. Differences of opin-",

    "title": "Directors’ Ownership in the U.S. Mutual",
    "abstract": "This paper empirically investigates directors’ ownership in the mutual fund industry. Our results show that, contrary to anecdotal evidence, a significant portion of direc- tors hold shares in the funds they oversee. Ownership patterns are broadly consistent with an optimal contracting equilibrium. That is, ownership is positively and signif- icantly correlated with most variables that are predicted to indicate greater value from directors’ monitoring. For example, directors’ ownership is more prevalent in ac- tively managed funds and in funds with lower institutional ownership. We also show considerable heterogeneity in ownership across fund families, suggesting family-wide policies play an important role. About Half OF ALL Households in the United States invest in open-end mutual funds. When buying shares in a mutual fund, investors delegate the manage- ment of their investment to fund managers (or advisers), hoping to benefit from their skills and experience in large-scale portfolio management. As in all principal-agent settings, conflicts of interest may emerge between the principal (in this case, fund investors) and the agent (in this case, fund managers), with the agent taking actions that may go against the interests of the principal. Ex- amples of investor-manager conflicts in mutual funds are provided by Mahoney (2004) and Tkac (2004). They range from issues of effort allocation to cases of fraudulent behavior such as the market timing and late trading charges that s",

    "title": "Disagreement and Learning: Dynamic Patterns",
    "abstract": "The empirical evidence on investor disagreement and trading volume is difﬁcult to reconcile in standard rational expectations models. We develop a dynamic model in which investors disagree about the interpretation of public information. We obtain a closed-form linear equilibrium that allows us to study which restrictions on the disagreement process yield empirically observed volume and return dynamics. We show that when investors have infrequent but major disagreements, there is positive autocorrelation in volume and positive correlation between volume and volatility. We also derive novel empirical predictions that relate the degree and frequency of disagreement to volume and volatility dynamics. THE Empirical Literature on trading volume has documented a number of regularities that cannot be easily explained by standard rational expecta- tions (RE hereafter) models in which investors share common priors and in- terpret information in the same way. A summary of earlier results can be found in Karpoff (1987) and Gallant, Rossi, and Tauchen (1992). More recently, Kandel and Pearson (1995) document signiﬁcant abnormal trading volume around earnings announcements, even when the announcement returns are close to zero. They also ﬁnd that analyst forecasts often diverge or ﬂip around earnings announcements, which they argue is inconsistent with models in which analysts agree on the interpretation of public information.

    "title": "Disappearing Call Delay and Dividend-Protected",
    "abstract": "Firms do not historically call their convertible bonds as soon as conversion can be forced. A number of explanations for the delay rely on the size of the dividends that bondholders forgo so long as they do not convert. We investigate an important change in convertible security design, namely, dividend protection of convertible bond issues. Dividend protection means that the conversion value of the convertible bond is unaffected by dividend payments and thus dividend-related rationales for call delay become moot. We document that call delay is near zero for dividend-protected convertible bonds. This Paper Documents THE rapid rise of callable convertibles that are dividend- protected, and the ensuing effect on convertible bond call policy. When a con- vertible is dividend-protected and a dividend is distributed, the number of shares to be received upon conversion increases so as to leave the bond’s conver- sion value unchanged. We ﬁnd that call delay is near zero for dividend-protected convertible bonds. The link between dividend protection and diminished call delay highlights the importance of dividends for understanding convertible call policy. Calling a convertible bond will force conversion provided the conversion value exceeds the call price.

    "title": "Disasters Implied by Equity Index Options",
    "abstract": "We use equity index options to quantify the distribution of consumption growth dis- asters. The challenge lies in connecting the risk-neutral distribution of equity returns implied by options to the true distribution of consumption growth. First, we compare pricing kernels constructed from macro-ﬁnance and option-pricing models. Second, we compare option prices derived from a macro-ﬁnance model to those we observe. Third, we compare the distribution of consumption growth derived from option prices using a macro-ﬁnance model to estimates based on macroeconomic data. All three perspectives suggest that options imply smaller probabilities of extreme outcomes than have been estimated from macroeconomic data. THE Field OF Macro-finance offers an attractive opportunity to explore links between asset returns and the real economy. Many of the most inﬂuential pa- pers in the ﬁeld do just that, most commonly by using macroeconomic data as inputs to models designed to account for asset returns. There is also promise in macroeconomic risk. The growing literature on disaster risk is a clear exam- ﬁnance. Barro (2006), Longstaff and Piazzesi (2004), and Rietz (1988) show that macroeconomic disasters—large declines in aggregate consumption growth— produce dramatic improvement in the ability of representative agent models to reproduce prominent features of U.S. Asset returns, including the equity premium.

    "title": "Disclosing a Random Walk",
    "abstract": "We examine a dynamic disclosure model in which the value of a ﬁrm follows a ran- dom walk. Every period, with some probability , the manager learns the ﬁrm’s value and decides whether to disclose it. The manager maximizes the market perception of the ﬁrm’s value, which is based on disclosed information. In equilibrium, the man- ager follows a threshold strategy with thresholds below current prices. He some- times reveals pessimistic information that reduces the market perception of the ﬁrm’s value. He does so to reduce future market uncertainty , which is valuable even under risk-neutrality . THE Analysis OF Voluntary Disclosure and its consequences for the func- tioning of markets intersects with accounting, economics, and ﬁnance. Existing literature on strategic disclosure focuses on static or dynamic models, with the asset having a ﬁxed value. This is at odds with a common feature of ﬁnancial and other markets, namely , that as information arrives, an asset’s (expected) value follows a random walk. Such stochastic evolution introduces new strate- gic considerations. The agent may decide to hide information, hoping to dis- close the value in the future only after it has increased. However, if the agent continues to hide information, the market could become more suspicious about the value. Therefore, in deciding whether to disclose information, the agent accounts for the effect of current and future market perceptions. Optimal dis- closure decisions depend on the agent’s exp",

    "title": "Disclosing to Informed Traders",
    "abstract": "We develop a model in which a ﬁrm’s manager can voluntarily disclose to privately informed investors. In equilibrium, the manager only discloses sufﬁciently favorable news. If the manager is known to be informed but disclosure is costly, the probability of disclosure increases with market liquidity and the stock trades at a discount rel- ative to expected cash ﬂows. However, when investors are uncertain about whether the manager is informed, disclosure can decrease with market liquidity and the stock can trade at a premium relative to expected cash ﬂows. Moreover, contrary to common intuition, public information can crowd in more voluntary disclosure. Voluntary Disclosures BY Firms Account for nearly two-thirds of the return variation created by ﬁrm-level public announcements (Beyer et al. (2010)). A large empirical literature studies how these disclosures relate to market outcomes, such as liquidity and average returns, which depend on in- vestor information. Yet existing theory is largely silent on how such voluntary disclosures affect trade based on private information and, conversely, how such information affects a ﬁrm’s propensity to disclose. 1 Moreover, understanding mous referees for their feedback.

    "title": "Discount Rates, Debt Maturity, and the Fiscal",
    "abstract": "This paper examines how the transmission of government portfolio risk arising from maturity operations depends on the stance of monetary/ﬁscal policy. Accounting for risk premia in the ﬁscal theory allows the government portfolio to affect expected inﬂation, even in a frictionless economy. The effects of maturity rebalancing on ex- pected inﬂation in the ﬁscal theory depend directly on the conditional nominal term premium, giving rise to an optimal debt-maturity policy that is state-dependent. In a calibrated macroﬁnance model, we demonstrate that maturity operations have siz- able effects on expected inﬂation and output through our novel risk transmission mechanism. Since THE Great Recession , Central Banks around the world have em- ployed large-scale asset purchases as an essential tool in a rapidly evolving policy landscape.

    "title": "Discount-Rate Risk in Private Equity: Evidence",
    "abstract": "Measures of private equity (PE) performance based on cash ﬂows do not account for a discount-rate risk premium that is a component of the capital asset pricing model (capm) alpha. We create secondary market PE indices and ﬁnd that PE discount rates vary considerably . Net asset values are too smooth because they fail to reﬂect variation in discount rates. Although the Capm alpha for our index is zero, the gen- eralized public market equivalent based on cash ﬂows is large and positive. We obtain similar results for a set of synthetic funds that invest in small cap stocks. Ignoring variation in PE discount rates can lead to a misallocation of capital. IN Recent Decades , Private Equity (PE) has become an important asset class for investors. A recent survey of institutional investors ﬁnds that 88% are invested in PE, with nearly a third having an allocation greater than 10% (Whyte (2017)).

    "abstract": "1850 The Journal of Finance Discussion Robert Marquez* This paper presents a very interesting and detailed analysis of auctions with non-cash bidding instruments. In particular, the authors analyze the use of debt, equity, debt and equity, preferred stock, and convertible securities as the bidding instruments. Non-cash auctions have been little analyzed in ei- ther the finance or the economics literature, and their application to corpo- rate reorganizations has not really been explored. As such, the paper is a significant contribution to a relatively sparse field of research, one that has generated a fair amount of discussion but few attempts at formal analysis. The setup of the paper is very general, delivering some quite interesting results while imposing very little structure on the model. The basic setup is as follows. N potential buyers are bidding for a bank- rupt firm. Each bidder has a \"type\" t, where the type correlates with the likelihood of a particular outcome. Specifically, for any type t, there is a range of possible outcomes (eventual values for the acquired firm) in an interval [v, v], with the outcomes distributed as G(v t) (so that t serves as an index over the distribution function of values). There is also a distribution of bidder types given by a function F(t), where F(.) is assumed to be strictly increasing and differentiable over some interval [t, t]. Finally, higher types are assumed to have better expected valuations for the acqui",

    "abstract": "This article disentangles the incentive and entrenchment effects of large owner- ship. Using data for 1,301 publicly traded corporations in eight East Asian econ- omies, we find that firm value increases with the cash-flow ownership of the largest shareholder, consistent with a positive incentive effect. But firm value falls when the control rights of the largest shareholder exceed its cash-flow ownership, con- sistent with an entrenchment effect. Given that concentrated corporate ownership is predominant in most countries, these findings have relevance for corporate gov- ernance across the world. THE Effects OF Ownership Structures on the value of firms have been re- searched extensively, with the role of large investors receiving special atten- tion. Investors with large ownership stakes have strong incentives to maximize their firms' value and are able to collect information and oversee managers, and so can help overcome one of the principal-agent problems in the modern corporation-that of conflicts of interest between shareholders and man- agers (Jensen and Meckling (1976)). Large shareholders also have strong incentives to put pressure on managers or even to oust them through a proxy fight or a takeover. For example, Shleifer and Vishny (1997, p. 754) point knowledges the financial support of the Hong Kong Government's Earmarked Grant and Direct Grant.

    "abstract": "We show that over the past half-century, innovative disruptions were central to understanding corporate defaults. In a given year, industries experiencing abnor- mally high venture capital or initial public offering activity subsequently see higher default rates, higher segment exits by conglomerates, and higher yields on bonds issued by the ﬁrms in these industries. Overall, we ﬁnd that disruption is a broad phenomenon, negatively affecting incumbent ﬁrms across the spectrum of age, valu- ation, and levers, with the exception of very large and low-leverage ﬁrms, in line with our central hypothesis. IN This Study, WE Show That Innovative Disruption —when new or less established ﬁrms gain an advantage from commercial and/or technological in- novation (Bower and Christensen (1995)( 1996))1—is central to understand- ing corporate defaults. The fact that disruption has been on the rise in the past two decades highlights the importance of this connection.

    "abstract": "The anomalous returns associated with net stock issues, accruals, and momentum are pervasive; they show up in all size groups (micro, small, and big) in cross-section regressions, and they are also strong in sorts, at least in the extremes. The asset growth and profitability anomalies are less robust. There is an asset growth anomaly in average returns on microcaps and small stocks, but it is absent for big stocks. Among profitable firms, higher profitability tends to be associated with abnormally high returns, but there is little evidence that unprofitable firms have unusually low returns. There ARE Patterns IN Average stock returns that are considered anomalies be- cause they are not explained by the Capital Asset Pricing Model (capm) of Sharpe (1964) and Lintner (1965). For example, Banz (1981) finds that stocks with low market capitalization (small stocks) have abnormally high average re- turns. Stocks with high ratios of book value to the market value of equity also have unusually high average returns (Rosenberg, Reid, and Lanstein (1985), Chan, Hamao, and Lakonishok (1991), Fama and French (1992)). Haugen and Baker (1996) and Cohen, Gompers, and Vuolteenaho (2002) find that more prof- itable firms have higher average stock returns, while Fairfield, Whisenant, and Yohn (2003) and Titman, Wei, and Xie (2004) show that firms that invest more have lower stock returns.

    "abstract": "We develop a new method to estimate Tobin’s Qs of conglomerate divisions without re- lying on standalone ﬁrms. Divisional Qs differ considerably from those of standalone ﬁrms across industries, over time, and in their sensitivity to economic shocks. The differences are explained by intraconglomerate covariance structures and access to internal capital markets that mitigate external ﬁnancing frictions. Consequently, the Qs capture variation in the allocation of assets in the economy: within ﬁrms through internal capital markets and across focused and diversiﬁed ﬁrms through diversify- ing acquisitions. Overall, our method provides opportunities to study the economic mechanisms that explain corporate diversiﬁcation. Most Large U.S. Firms Operate in multiple divisions. Such conglomerates account for the lion’s share of ﬁnancing, investment, and value of U.S. Compa- nies. Consequently, a vast literature in ﬁnancial economics studies conglomer- ates, focusing on conglomerate value and internal capital allocation. 1 An im- portant empirical challenge faced by this literature is that direct estimates of divisional valuations and investment opportunities are not available.

They also have lower net cash ﬂows than matched unlisted Chinese ﬁrms. The underper- formance of both stock and accounting returns is more pronounced for large A-share ﬁrms, while small ﬁrms show no underperformance along either dimension. Investor sentiment explains low stock returns in the cross-country and within-A-share sam- ples.

    "abstract": "How far does mobility of multinational banks solve problems of financial develop- ment? Using a panel of 80,000 loans over 7 years, I show that greater cultural and geographical distance between a foreign bank’s headquarters and local branches leads it to further avoid lending to “informationally difficult” yet fundamentally sound firms requiring relational contracting. Greater distance also makes them less likely to bi- laterally renegotiate, and less successful at recovering defaults. Differences in bank size, legal institutions, risk preferences, or unobserved borrower heterogeneity cannot explain these results. These distance constraints can be large enough to permanently exclude certain sectors of the economy from financing by foreign banks.

    "title": "Diversification Discount or Premium? New",
    "abstract": "I use the Business Information Tracking Series (bits), a new census database that covers the whole U.S. Economy at the establishment level, to examine whether the finding of a diversification discount is an artifact of segment data. Bits data allow me to construct business units that are more consistently and objectively defined than segments, and thus more comparable across firms. Using these data on a sample that yields a discount according to segment data, I find a diversification premium. The premium is robust to variations in the sample, business unit definition, and measures of excess value and diversification. THE Diversification Discount has been the subject of an active debate in cor- porate finance during the past few years. 1 On the one hand, Lang and Stulz (1994), Berger and Ofek (1995), and Servaes (1996) find that diversified firms trade at an average discount relative to single-segment firms. This finding has often been interpreted as evidence that diversification destroys value. 2 On the other hand, several studies show that the discount is only the product of sample selection biases. Villalonga (1999) and Campa and Kedia (2002) find that diversified firms traded at a discount prior to diversifying. More generally, diversifying and nondiversifying firms differ systematically in multiple char- acteristics.

    "abstract": "Within a rational general equilibrium model in which agents care only about personal consumption, we consider a setting in which, due to borrowing constraints, individuals endowed with local resources underparticipate in financial markets. As a result, in- vestors compete for local resources through their portfolio choices. Even with complete yields a Pareto-dominated outcome as agents introduce “community” risk unrelated to fundamentals. Moreover, if some agents are behaviorally biased, or cannot com- pletely diversify their holdings, rational agents may choose more extreme portfolios and amplify the effect. I’ve been saving like crazy. I’m expecting that when I’m 80 and need part- time nursing care, I’m going to be bidding against a lot of people for that (Wall Street Journal, 3/4/2003, quoting a money manager). We each consume different consumption baskets. An 80-year-old consumes nursing services that are not consumed by a 30-year-old. A person who lives in Manhattan cares about dining in a local restaurant or renting an apartment in New York; he cares less about these services if he lives in the Midwest. As a result of these taste differences, investors in a sense are divided into different communities (where “community” can have a geographic and/or demographic interpretation). Within each community, investors compete for local resources. Anticipating this competition, should investors take into account the invest- ment decisions of other community members when choosing",

    "abstract": "Social status concerns inﬂuence investors’ decisions by driving a wedge in attitudes toward aggregate and idiosyncratic risks. I model such concerns by emphasizing the desire to “get ahead of the Joneses,” which implies that aversion to idiosyncratic risk is lower than aversion to aggregate risk. The model predicts that investors hold concentrated portfolios in equilibrium, which helps rationalize the small premium for undiversiﬁed entrepreneurial risk. In the model, status concerns are more important for wealthier households. Consequently, these households own a disproportionate share of risky assets, particularly private equity, and experience greater volatility of consumption, consistent with empirical evidence. Diversification AND Risk SHARINGare fundamental principles of modern ﬁnance and macroeconomics. However, empirical evidence suggests that household portfolios are poorly diversiﬁed, with many people reporting substantial hold- ings of a single stock. For the wealthiest households large shares in closely held businesses constitute a particularly important source of risk (e.g., Heaton and Lucas (2000a)). It is not surprising that entrepreneurs bear substantial undi- versiﬁed risk, since it is important for mitigating moral hazard and/or adverse selection problems. Yet, from a standpoint of portfolio theory, entrepreneur- ship does not appear to be well compensated, implying that many investors are willing to take poorly rewarded risks despite the availability of supe",

    "title": "Divestitures and Divisional Investment Policies",
    "abstract": "We study a sample of diversified firms that alter their organizational structure by divesting a business segment. These firms experience a reduction in the di- versification discount after the divestiture. We show that the efficiency of seg- ment investment increases substantially following the divestiture and that this improvement is associated with a decrease in the diversification discount. Our results support the corporate focus and financing hypotheses for corpo- rate divestitures. We demonstrate that inefficient investment is partly respon- sible for the diversification discount and show that asset sales lead to an improvement in the efficiency of investment for remaining divisions. It is well known that diversified firms trade at a discount relative to stand-alone firms.1 However, there is debate over the cause of the discount. A commonly held view is that inefficient investment policies of diversified firms are to blame for the diversification discount. For instance, Lamont (1997) suggests the inefficient in- vestment hypothesis by showing that diversified oil companies cut back on invest- ment in non-oil divisions when oil prices declined during the 1980s. Shin and Stulz (1998) find that divisional resources do not appear to be directed to seg- ments with the most favorable investment opportunities. Scharfstein (1998) shows that misallocation of resources between divisions is most pronounced when management has a small ownership stake and suggests that agency costs u",

Supporting “the information content of dividends hypothesis,” we find that dividend changes provide information about the level of profitability in subsequent years, incremen- tal to market and accounting data. We also document that dividend changes are positively related to earnings changes in each of the two years after the dividend change. It is well documented that dividend changes are positively associated with stock returns in the days surrounding the dividend change announcement ~see, e.g., Aharony and Swary ~1980!, Asquith and Mullins ~1983!, Kalay and Loewenstein ~1985!, and Petit ~1972!!.

    "abstract": "We examine whether the market interprets changes in dividends as a signal about the persistence of past earnings changes. Prior to observing this signal, investors may believe that past earnings changes are not necessarily indicative of future earnings levels. We empirically investigate whether a change in dividends alters investors’ as- sessments about the valuation implications of past earnings. Results confirm the hy- pothesis that changes in dividends cause investors to revise their expectations about the persistence of past earnings changes. This effect varies predictably with the mag- nitude of the dividend change and the sign of the past earnings change. This Study Examines THE Role OF Changes in dividends in informing investors about the persistence of past earnings changes. The persistence of earnings is the extent to which an unexpected change in earnings revises expectations of future earnings (for one or more periods) in the same direction as the unex- pected change. Prior theory and evidence suggest that highly persistent changes in earnings are more indicative of changes in firm value than less persistent changes in earnings.

This uncertainty about the persistence of earnings is resolved as later earnings announcements for subsequent quarters provide additional information. 2 Changes in dividends may also play a role in revising investors’ assessments of the persistence o",

    "abstract": "Many leading asset pricing models are speciﬁed so that the term structure of dividend volatility is either ﬂat or upward sloping. These models predict that the term struc- tures of expected returns and volatilities on dividend strips (i.e., claims to dividends paid over a prespeciﬁed interval) are also upward sloping. However, the empirical ev- idence suggests otherwise. This discrepancy can be reconciled if these models replace their proposed dividend dynamics with processes that generate stationary leverage ratios. Under such policies, shareholders are forced to divest (invest) when leverage is low (high), which shifts risk from long- to short-horizon dividend strips. Recent Advances IN CONSUMPTION-based asset pricing models have created an embarrassment of riches in that several competing frameworks are now able to capture many salient features of security prices that were once considered puzzling (e.g., high excess returns and volatilities for stocks, low levels and volatilities for interest rates). Due to these successes, there has been a push to identify additional empirical moments in the hope of distinguishing between the different frameworks. For example, recently there has been considerable interest in the pricing and return properties of so-called dividend strips, which are claims to dividends paid over a prespeciﬁed time interval in the future. These assets provide information regarding the term structures of both the the Nber. This paper was previously entitled “",

    "abstract": "We present a latent variable model of dividends that predicts, out-of-sample, 39.5% to 41.3% of the variation in annual dividend growth rates between 1975 and 2016. Further, when learning about dividend dynamics is incorporated into a long-run risks model, the model predicts, out-of-sample, 25.3% to 27.1% of the variation in annual stock index returns over the same time horizon, with learning contributing approximately half of the predictability in returns. These ﬁndings support the view that investors’ aversion to long-run risks and their learning about these risks are important in determining stock index prices and expected returns. THE Average Return ON EQUITIEShas been substantially higher than the aver- age return on risk-free bonds over long periods of time. For instance, between 1946 and 2016, the S&P500 earned 66 basis points more per month than 30-day T-bills (i.e., over 7% annualized). Over the years, many dynamic equilibrium asset pricing models have been proposed in an attempt to understand why risks in equities require such a large premium and why risk-free rates are so low. A common feature in most of these models is that the risk premium on equi- ties does not remain constant over time, but rather varies in a systematic and stochastic manner. Given a large number of studies ﬁnd evidence of such pre- dictable variation in the equity premium, Lettau and Ludvigson (2001, p. 842) conclude that “it is now widely accepted that excess returns are predictable by variab",

    "abstract": "Prior empirical evidence regarding the impact of dividend taxes on firm valua- tion is mixed. This study avoids some of the complications encountered in pre- vious empirical work by exploiting institutional characteristics of REITs, such as their limited discretion over dividend policy and the relative transpar- ency of Reit assets. We regress the market value of equity on the market value of assets and tax basis, which creates tax deductions that lower future divi- dend taxes without affecting future pretax cash flow. We find that firm value is positively related to tax basis, suggesting that future dividend taxes are capitalized into share prices. Financial Economists have debated the impact of dividend taxes on firm valua- tion and the cost of equity capital for decades. In 1970, Brennan proposed that investors should impose a price penalty on the shares of high-dividend firms be- cause capital gains are tax-preferred relative to dividends. In 1978, Miller and Scholes countered that prices may not reflect shareholder taxes because the mar- ginal investor could be a tax-exempt institution. Simultaneously, King (1977), Auerbach (1979), and Bradford (1981) posited that dividend taxes should be capi- talized into share prices for all firms that will eventually distribute earnings through dividends, not just for firms that pay current dividends.

    "abstract": "We show that repurchases have not only became an important form of payout for U.S. Corporations, but also that firms finance their share repurchases with funds that otherwise would have been used to increase dividends. We find that young firms have a higher propensity to pay cash through repurchases than they did in the past and that repurchases have become the preferred form of initiating a cash payout. Although large, established firms have generally not cut their dividends, they also show a higher propensity to pay out cash through repurchases. These findings indicate that firms have gradually substituted repurchases for dividends. Our results also suggest that before 1983, regulatory constraints inhibited firms from aggressively repurchasing shares. For decades, U.S. Corporations have overwhelmingly preferred to pay out cash in the form of dividends rather than share repurchases, despite the relative tax advantage of capital gains over ordinary income. However, over the last 20 years or so, share repurchase activity has experienced an ex- traordinary growth. According to aggregate data from Compustat, expendi- tures on share repurchase programs (relative to total earnings) increased from 4.8 percent in 1980 to 41.8 percent in 2000. Furthermore, while share repurchase expenditures grew at an average annual rate of 26.1 percent over the period 1980 to 2000, dividends only grew at an average annual rate of 6.8 percent.

    "abstract": "Using hand-collected data on divisional managers at S&P 500 ﬁrms, we study their role in internal capital budgeting. Divisional managers with social connections to the CEO receive more capital. Connections to the CEO outweigh measures of managers’ formal inﬂuence, such as seniority and board membership, and affect both manage- rial appointments and capital allocations. The effect of connections on investment efﬁciency depends on the tradeoff between agency and information asymmetry. Un- der weak governance, connections reduce investment efﬁciency and ﬁrm value via favoritism. Under high information asymmetry, connections increase investment ef- ﬁciency and ﬁrm value via information transfer. Divisional Managers Play ANimportant role in theories of internal capital mar- kets. The bright-side view posits that internal capital markets beneﬁt from stronger control rights and superior information provided by divisional man- agers, which enable the CEO to make better allocation decisions.1 The dark- side view holds that internal capital markets suffer from agency motives of divisional managers and the CEO, who pursue private interests.2 The impor- tance of divisional managers in the theoretical literature is also supported by comments from an anonymous referee, an Associate Editor, John Graham (the Coeditor), Cam Harvey (the Editor), Kenneth Ahern, Joey Engelberg, Ted Fee, Cesare Fracassi, Byoung-Hyoun Hwang, Roni Kisin, John Matsusaka, Oguzhan Ozbas, Mitchell Petersen, conference",

    "title": "Do Acquisitions Relieve Target Firms’ Financial",
    "abstract": "Managers often claim that target ﬁrms are ﬁnancially constrained prior to being acquired and that these constraints are eased following the acquisition. Using a large sample of European acquisitions, we document that the level of cash that target ﬁrms hold, the sensitivity of cash to cash ﬂow, and the sensitivity of investment to cash ﬂow all decline, while investment increases following the acquisition. These effects are stronger in deals that are more likely to be associated with ﬁnancing improvements. Our ﬁndings suggest that acquisitions relieve ﬁnancial frictions in target ﬁrms, especially when the target ﬁrm is relatively small. IN A World WITHimperfect capital markets, ﬁrms sometimes face ﬁnancial con- straints and have to forgo valuable investment opportunities. For ﬁrms in this situation, an acquisition can potentially mitigate such constraints if the ac- quirer’s access to capital enables the target to undertake an increased number of positive net present value investments. Being part of a larger organization subsequent to an acquisition can improve ﬁnancing through better direct ac- cess to capital markets, and also by the possibility of a reallocation of capital across divisions (see, e.g., Stein (2003)). Accordingly, practitioners often justify acquisitions by claiming that acquirers can better expand the target’s oper- ations because of both their internally generated cash ﬂow and their ability to raise capital externally. 1 Yet despite the enormous literature o",

    "title": "Do Bank Relationships Affect the Firm’s",
    "abstract": "This paper studies the effect of bank relationships on underwriter choice in the U.S. Corporate-bond underwriting market following the 1989 commercial-bank entry. I find that bank relationships have positive and significant effects on a firm’s underwriter choice, over and above their effects on fees. This result is sharply stronger for junk- bond issuers and first-time issuers. I also find that there is a significant fee discount when there are relationships between firms and commercial banks. Finally, I find that serving as arranger of past loan transactions has the strongest effect on underwriter choice, whereas serving merely as participant has no effect. Before THE Historic Wave OF Deregulation swept the U.S. Financial industry in 1989, a small number of top-tier investment banks dominated the underwriting market for corporate securities. Once the wave hit, commercial banks success- fully entered the market. In 1989, five commercial banks were granted permis- sion to establish Section 20 subsidiaries to underwrite corporate bonds. 1 Within a few years, commercial banks made substantial inroads into the top echelon of this market. Between 1993 and 1996, the top 10 investment banks’ collective market share was 11 percentage points less than it had been between 1985 and 1988 (from 87% to 76%) while the top five commercial banks collectively accounted for 13% of corporate-bond underwriting.

    "title": "Do Bankruptcy Codes Matter? A Study",
    "abstract": "Using a sample of small firms that defaulted on their bank debt in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, we find that large differences in creditors’ rights across countries lead banks to adjust their lending and reorganization practices to mitigate costly aspects of bankruptcy law. In particular, French banks respond to a creditor- unfriendly code by requiring more collateral than lenders elsewhere, and by relying on collateral forms that minimize the statutory dilution of their claims in bankruptcy. Despite such adjustments, bank recovery rates in default remain sharply different across the three countries, reflecting very different levels of creditor protection. HOW DO Bankruptcy Codes Affect Distressed reorganizations, and can lenders overcome the lack of creditor protection by adjusting their lending practices at loan origination? We use a large sample of defaulted small-to-medium size firms from 10 banks in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom to address these questions, and find country bankruptcy codes to be important determinants of outcomes of distress, despite significant adjustments in banks’ practices in response to particular provisions of their respective codes. With flexibility in writing and renegotiating debt contracts, the effect of state- imposed bankruptcy law on lending and distress is an empirical question. On the one hand, one might expect different outcomes of default depending on the level of creditor protection provided by the bankruptcy code.",

    "title": "Do Banks Affect the Level and Composition",
    "abstract": "In theory, better access to bank credit can reduce or increase output volatility depending on whether firms are more financially constrained during contractions or expansions. This paper finds that the volatility of industrial output is lower in coun- tries with more bank credit. Most of the reduction in volatility is idiosyncratic, which follows from the ability of banks to pool and diversify shocks. Systematic volatility is reduced less strongly. Volatility dampening is achieved via countercyclical borrowing: At the firm level, short-term borrowing is less (or more negatively) correlated with sales and inventories in countries with high levels of bank credit. There IS A Debate About THE Effect OF Financial Intermediaries —or financial development more generally—on the volatility of output. In theory, the effect on volatility of having more financial intermediation is ambiguous, depending on the stage of the country’s development (Aghion, Bacchetta, and Banerjee (2004)) or the type of shocks that affect the economy (e.g., real vs. Monetary shocks as in Bacchetta and Caminal (2000), or credit demand versus credit supply shocks as in Morgan, Rime, and Strahan (2004)). The existing empirical evidence is also inconclusive. For instance, while Acemoglu et al. (2003) show that macroeconomic aggregates are less volatile in more developed countries, Beck, Lundberg, and Majnoni (2004) find no robust relation between financial intermediation and output volatility when considering diff",

    "title": "Do Banks Provide Financial Slack?",
    "abstract": "We study the decision to choose bank debt rather than public securities in a firm's marginal financing choice. Using a sample of 500 firms over the 1980 to 1993 time period, we find that firms are relatively more likely to choose bank loans when variables that measure asymmetric information problems are elevated. The sen- sitivity of the likelihood of choosing bank debt to information problems is greater for firms with no public debt outstanding. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that banks help alleviate asymmetric information problems and that firms weigh these information benefits against a wide range of contracting costs when choosing bank financing. WHY DO Some Firms Borrow from public sources while others rely exclusively on private lenders? The answer to this question is not well understood. Ex- isting theories suggest that a firm must consider the tradeoff between the benefits and costs of bank debt financing relative to other potential financ- ing choices. The potential benefits of bank financing include low moral haz- ard and adverse selection costs and ease of renegotiation in financial distress.1 The potential costs of bank financing include monitoring costs, suboptimal liquidation outcomes, and distortions induced by information monopolies.2 The goal of this paper is to identify whether adverse selection problems influence a firm's choice between new bank debt, public debt, or common stock. In particular, we are interested in assessing the empirica",

    "title": "Do Behavioral Biases Affect Prices?",
    "abstract": "This paper documents strong evidence for behavioral biases among Chicago Board of Trade proprietary traders and investigates the effect these biases have on prices. Our traders appear highly loss-averse, regularly assuming above-average afternoon risk to recover from morning losses. This behavior has important short-term consequences for afternoon prices, as losing traders actively purchase contracts at higher prices and sell contracts at lower prices than those that prevailed previously. However, the market appears to distinguish these risk-seeking trades from informed trading. Prices set by loss-averse traders are reversed significantly more quickly than those set by unbiased traders. A Number OF Recent Papers in the finance literature have proposed behavioral theories to account for asset pricing anomalies. 1 To provide support for their models’ assumptions about investor behavior, these papers draw heavily on the experimental psychology literature, in which evidence of cognitive biases is abundant. On the one hand, behavioralists contend that this evidence has been important in prompting researchers to consider heterodox explanations of market anomalies. On the other hand, skeptics argue that there exists so much of such evidence that behavioralists can “psycho-mine” the experimental psychology literature to find support for the particular set of assumptions that allow their models to match otherwise anomalous data. Contributing to the skeptics’ argument, many of the beha",

    "title": "Do Bonds Span Volatility Risk in the U.S.",
    "abstract": "We propose using model-free yield quadratic variation measures computed from in- traday data as a tool for speciﬁcation testing and selection of dynamic term structure models. We ﬁnd that the yield curve fails to span realized yield volatility in the U.S. Treasury market, as the systematic volatility factors are largely unrelated to the cross-section of yields. We conclude that a broad class of afﬁne diffusive, quadratic Gaussian, and afﬁne jump-diffusive models cannot accommodate the observed yield volatility dynamics. Hence, the Treasury market per se is incomplete, as yield volatil- ity risk cannot be hedged solely through Treasury securities. Virtually ALL Variation Inu.s. Treasury Rates is captured by three factors, interpreted by Litterman and Scheinkman (1991) as changes in “level,” “steep- ness,” and “curvature.” This fact has directly motivated an extensive body of work on reduced-form term structure models in which bond yields are ex- pressed as an afﬁne (or quadratic) function of a low-dimensional state vector; see, for example, Dufﬁe and Kan (1996), Dufﬁe, Pan, and Singleton (2000), and Piazzesi (2003).

    "title": "Do Bonds Span the Fixed Income Markets?",
    "abstract": "Most term structure models assume bond markets are complete, that is, that all fixed income derivatives can be perfectly replicated using solely bonds. How- ever, we find that, in practice, swap rates have limited explanatory power for returns on at-the-money straddles-portfolios mainly exposed to volatility risk. We term this empirical feature \"unspanned stochastic volatility\" (USV). While USV can be captured within an HJM framework, we demonstrate that bivariate models cannot exhibit USV. We determine necessary and sufficient conditions for trivariate Markov affine systems to exhibit USV. For such USV models, bonds alone may not be sufficient to identify all parameters. Rather, derivatives are needed. Most Time-homogeneous Models of the term structure predict that bond prices are sufficient to complete the fixed income markets. One implication of this prediction is that fixed income derivatives are redundant securities. Another (related) implication is that bonds can be used to hedge volatility risk. These implications are in contrast to the equity-derivative literature, where it is common to assume that volatility risk cannot be hedged by trading in the underlying stock alone (e.g., Heston (1993)). In such a case, stock options are not redundant securities.1 In this paper, we present empirical evidence suggesting that interest rate volatility risk cannot be hedged by a portfolio consisting solely of bonds.

    "title": "Do Buyouts (Still) Create Value?",
    "abstract": "We examine how leveraged buyouts from the most recent wave of public to private transactions created value. Buyouts completed between 1990 and 2006 are more con- servatively priced and less levered than their predecessors from the 1980s. For deals with post-buyout data available, median market- and risk-adjusted returns to pre- (post-) buyout capital invested are 72.5% (40.9%). In contrast, gains in operating per- formance are either comparable to or slightly exceed those observed for benchmark ﬁrms. Increases in industry valuation multiples and realized tax beneﬁts from in- creasing leverage, while private, are each economically as important as operating gains in explaining realized returns. THE Leveraged Buyout(lbo) wave of the 1980s was an important phenomenon well studied by academics and practitioners. The recession of the early 1990s, however, brought most of that activity to an end, as many of the deals from later in that period defaulted. Nearly 15 years later, however, the pace of LBO activity reached new record levels, renewing questions about whether and how these deals create value. A substantial body of empirical work based on leveraged buyout transac- tions from the 1980s supports the notion that leveraged transactions create value. Several studies show large gains in operating performance following the buyout; theories attribute these gains to reduced agency costs through the dis- ciplining effects of leverage and better governance (monitoring by the ﬁnancial s",

    "title": "Do CEOs Matter? Evidence from Hospitalization",
    "abstract": "Using variation in ﬁrms’ exposure to their CEOs resulting from hospitalization, we es- timate the effect of chief executive ofﬁcers (CEOs) on ﬁrm policies, holding ﬁrm-CEO matches constant. We document three main ﬁndings. First, CEOs have a signiﬁcant effect on proﬁtability and investment. Second, CEO effects are larger for younger CEOs, in growing and family-controlled ﬁrms, and in human-capital-intensive indus- tries. Third, CEOs are unique: the hospitalization of other senior executives does not have similar effects on the performance. Overall, our ﬁndings demonstrate that CEOs are a key driver of ﬁrm performance, which suggests that CEO contingency plans are valuable. IN This Paper , WE USE variation in ﬁrms’ exposure to their chief executive ofﬁcer (CEO) resulting from hospitalization to estimate the effect of CEOs on ﬁrm performance. The basic premise behind this test is that hospitalizations affect managers’ ability to perform their jobs as they are physically away from the ofﬁce or convalescing from a medical condition. Econometrically, this test is attractive because it allows us to assess how ﬁrm outcomes change as ﬁrms’ exposure to their CEO varies, holding the ﬁrm-CEO match constant. To investigate this issue empirically, we use ﬁrm, CEO, and hospitaliza- tion data from 12,753 Danish ﬁrms from 1996 to 2012.

    "abstract": "Contrary to conventional wisdom, growth stocks (i.e., low book-to-market stocks) do not havesubstantially higher future cash-ﬂow growth rates than value stocks, in both rebalanced and buy-and-hold portfolios. Efﬁciency growth, survivorship and look-back biases, and the rebalancing effect help explain the results. These ﬁndings suggest that duration alone is unlikely to explain the value premium. Growth Stocks, Defined AS Stocks With LOWbook-to-market ratios, have lower future returns than value stocks with high book-to-market ratios. But do growth stocks have substantially higher future cash-ﬂow growth rates and longer cash-ﬂow durations? While this question is interesting in its own right, it is important for the following reason. Several recent papers provide an inﬂuential duration-based explanation for the value premium (Lettau and Wachter (2007, 2011), Croce, Lettau, and Ludvigson (2010)). This explana- tion has two key ingredients: the term structure of equity is downward slop- ing (long-duration assets earn lower expected returns), and growth and value stocks differ substantially in the timing of cash ﬂows, in that cash ﬂows of growth stocks grow faster than cash ﬂows of value stocks.

    "title": "Do Conglomerate Firms Allocate Resources",
    "abstract": "We develop a profit-maximizing neoclassical model of optimal firm size and growth across different industries based on differences in industry fundamentals and firm productivity. In the model, a conglomerate discount is consistent with profit max- imization. The model predicts how conglomerate firms will allocate resources across divisions over the business cycle and how their responses to industry shocks will differ from those of single-segment firms. Using plant level data, we find that growth and investment of conglomerate and single-segment firms is related to fundamental industry factors and individual segment level productivity. The ma- jority of conglomerate firms exhibit growth across industry segments that is con- sistent with optimal behavior. Several Recent Academic Papers and the business press claim that conglom- erate firms destroy value and do a poor job of investing across business segments.1 Explanations for this underperformance share the idea that there is an imperfection either in firm governance (agency theory) or in financial markets (incorrect valuation of firm industry segments). These studies im- plicitly assume that the conglomerates and single-industry firms possess similar ability to compete, and that they differ mainly in that conglomerates circulated and presented with the title \"Optimal Firm Size and the Growth of Conglomerate wish to thank the editor, Rene Stulz, two anonymous referees, John Graham, Robert Hauswald, Sheridan Titman, Anjan Thako",

    "title": "Do Credit Markets Respond to Macroeconomic",
    "abstract": "The response of corporate bond credit spreads to three exogenous macro shocks—oil supply, investment-speciﬁc technology, and government spending—is large, signiﬁ- cant, and a mirror image of macroeconomic activity. This countercyclicality is driven largely by credit risk premia and translates into signiﬁcant return predictability. Eq- uity risk premia exhibit similar responses, providing external validity. Information rigidities and leverage play a key role in the transmission of the shocks. Since causal evidence linking macro shocks to credit markets is scarce and recent work highlights the real effects of credit ﬂuctuations, our ﬁndings contribute to understanding the joint dynamics of credit markets and the macroeconomy. A Long -standing Goal OF Macro ﬁnance is to disentangle the relation between credit markets and macroeconomic ﬂuctuations. Recent empirical work shows that corporate bond credit spreads lead macroeconomic activity. 1 However, the reverse empirical relation—whether macroeconomic shocks lead credit spreads—has received little attention.

    "abstract": "Using a regression discontinuity design, we provide evidence that there are sharp and substantial employment cuts following loan covenant violations, when creditors gain rights to accelerate, restructure, or terminate a loan. The cuts are larger at ﬁrms with higher ﬁnancing frictions and with weaker employee bargaining power, and during in- dustry and macroeconomic downturns, when employees have fewer job opportunities. Union elections that create new labor bargaining units lead to higher loan spreads, consistent with creditors requiring compensation when employees gain bargaining power. Overall, binding ﬁnancial contracts have a large impact on employees and are an ampliﬁcation mechanism of economic downturns.

    "title": "Do Dividend Clienteles Exist? Evidence on",
    "abstract": "We study stock holdings and trading behavior of more than 60,000 households and find evidence consistent with dividend clienteles. Retail investor stock holdings indicate a preference for dividend yield that increases with age and decreases with income, consistent with age and tax clienteles, respectively. Trading patterns reinforce this evidence: Older, low-income investors disproportionally purchase stocks before the ex- dividend day. Furthermore, among small stocks, the ex-day price drop decreases with age and increases with income, consistent with clientele effects. Finally, consistent with the behavioral “attention” hypothesis, we document that older and low-income investors purchase stocks following dividend announcements. More Than 40 Years AGO Miller and Modigliani (1961) argued that dividend clienteles could form based on investor characteristics. According to their hy- pothesis, firms that pay lower (higher) dividends attract investors who dislike (like) dividend income, and this creates the potential for an optimal match between the dividend policy of a firm and the dividend preferences of its stock- holders. For instance, tax-exempt institutional investors and retail investors with low marginal tax rates are likely to prefer high dividend yield (DY) stocks. Miller and Modigliani also argue that clienteles might form based on age or in- come preferences. They conjecture that “young ‘accumulators’ prefer low-payout shares and retired persons lean toward ‘income’ sto",

    "abstract": "Using transaction data from Indonesia, this paper shows that domestic investors have higher profits than foreign investors. In addition, clients of global brokerages have higher long-term and smaller medium (intramonth) and short (intraday) term profits than clients of local brokerages. This suggests that clients of local brokerages have a short-lived information advantage, but that clients of global brokerages are better at picking long-term winners. Finally, domestic clients of global brokerages have higher profits than foreign clients of global brokerages, suggesting that the combination of local information and global expertise leads to higher profits. THE Question OF Whether Domestic Investors have better information than for- eign investors is increasingly controversial. There are arguments that support both sides of the issue. One argument is that domestic investors have an ad- vantage because information does not have to travel over physical, linguistic, or cultural distances. Conversely, foreign investors may have an information ad- vantage because they have a significant amount of investment experience and expertise. Formal empirical evidence on this issue is also mixed.

    "abstract": "Due to their low trading costs, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are a potential catalyst for short-horizon liquidity traders. The liquidity shocks can propagate to the under- lying securities through the arbitrage channel, and ETFs may increase the nonfun- damental volatility of the securities in their baskets. We exploit exogenous changes in index membership and ﬁnd that stocks with higher ETF ownership display sig- niﬁcantly higher volatility. ETF ownership increases the negative autocorrelation in stock prices. The increase in volatility appears to introduce undiversiﬁable risk in prices because stocks with high ETF ownership earn a signiﬁcant risk premium of up to 56 basis points monthly. Exchange-traded Funds(etfs) ARE increasingly popular in ﬁnancial markets. Introduced in the early 1990s, today this asset class boasts $2.5 trillion in assets under management (AUM) in the United States ($3.5 trillion globally), accounting for about 35% of the volume in U.S. Equity markets.

    "abstract": "Analyzing a panel that matches public firms with worker-level data, we find that man- agerial entrenchment affects workers’ pay. CEOs with more control pay their workers more, but financial incentives through cash flow rights ownership mitigate such be- havior. Entrenched CEOs pay more to employees closer to them in the corporate hier- archy, geographically closer to the headquarters, and associated with conflict-inclined unions. The evidence is consistent with entrenched CEOs paying more to enjoy pri- vate benefits such as lower effort wage bargaining and improved social relations with employees. Our results show that managerial ownership and corporate governance can play an important role for employee compensation. THE Separation OF Ownership AND Control between shareholders and managers in public corporations can play an important role in determining the level of pay to a firm’s manager (whom we will interchangeably refer to as the CEO), but also the pay to the firm’s workers.

    "abstract": "We examine equity markets’ reaction to the ﬁrst-time disclosure of the CEO-worker pay ratio by U.S. Public companies in 2018. We ﬁnd that ﬁrms disclosing higher pay ratios experience signiﬁcantly lower abnormal announcement returns. Firms whose shareholders are more inequality-averse experience a more negative market response to high pay ratios. Furthermore, during 2018 more inequality-averse investors rebal- ance their portfolios away from stocks with a high pay ratio relative to other in- vestors. Our results suggest that equity markets are concerned about high within- ﬁrm pay dispersion, and investors’ inequality aversion is a channel through which high pay ratios negatively affect ﬁrm value. Stagnant Middle -class Wages BUT Rapidly increasing incomes by high earners have led to a growing debate about income inequality in the United States (Acemoglu and Autor ( 2011), Piketty ( 2014)).

    "title": "Do Financial Institutions Matter&#x003F;",
    "abstract": "In standard asset pricing theory, investors are assumed to invest directly in finan- cial markets. The role of financial institutions is ignored. The focus in corporate finance is on agency problems. How do you ensure that managers act in share- holders' interests? There is an inconsistency in assuming that when you give your money to a financial institution there is no agency problem, but when you give it to a firm there is. It is argued that both areas need to take proper account of the role of financial institutions and markets. Appropriate concepts for analyzing par- ticular situations should be used. When I WAS AN Assistant Professor, my view on referees was that nine out of ten of them were complete idiots. They obviously had no idea what my papers were about or they would not have rejected them. Fortunately the remaining one out of ten was astute and sometimes would actually recom- mend a revise and resubmit. Over the years, I learned where the problem lay and it was not with the referees. By the time I was an editor, my opinion on referees had been reversed and I realized how much they could contribute to a paper. Because of this, I decided that for my Presidential Address, which that I have been working on. If you want to read that, see Allen and Gale (2000a).

    "title": "Do Firms Hedge in Response",
    "abstract": "There are two tax incentives for corporations to hedge: to increase debt capacity and interest tax deductions, and to reduce expected tax liability if the tax function is convex. We test whether these incentives affect the extent of corporate hedging with derivatives. Using an explicit measure of tax function convexity, we find no evidence that firms hedge in response to tax convexity. Our analysis does, however, indicate that firms hedge to increase debt capacity, with increased tax benefits averaging 1.1 percent of firm value. Our results also indicate that firms hedge because of expected financial distress costs and firm size. AN Increasing Number OF Corporations use financial derivatives each year. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association reports that the no- tional value of outstanding OTC swap contracts increased from $11.3 trillion in 1994 to more than $60 trillion by mid-2000 (http://www.isda.org). This is interesting because financial theory tells us that corporate risk manage- ment enhances value only in the presence of costly market imperfections. A number of empirical studies examine derivative holdings to identify which of the proposed theoretical incentives and imperfections lead to corporate hedg- ing. Our paper adds to the hedging literature by testing whether corpora- tions respond to two tax-related incentives to hedge: the incentive to reduce volatility, thereby increasing debt capacity and the tax benefits of debt, and the incentive to reduce ex",

    "title": "Do Firms Rebalance Their Capital Structures?",
    "abstract": "We empirically examine whether firms engage in a dynamic rebalancing of their cap- ital structures while allowing for costly adjustment. We begin by showing that the presence of adjustment costs has significant implications for corporate financial policy and the interpretation of previous empirical results. After confirming that financing behavior is consistent with the presence of adjustment costs, we find that firms ac- tively rebalance their leverage to stay within an optimal range. Our evidence suggests that the persistent effect of shocks on leverage observed in previous studies is more likely due to adjustment costs than indifference toward capital structure. A Traditional View IN Corporate Finance is that firms strive to maintain an opti- mal capital structure that balances the costs and benefits associated with vary- ing degrees of financial leverage. When firms are perturbed from this optimum, this view argues that companies respond by rebalancing their leverage back to the optimal level. However, recent empirical evidence has led researchers to question whether firms actually engage in such a dynamic rebalancing of their capital structures. Fama and French (2002), among others, note that firms’ debt ratios adjust slowly toward their targets. That is, firms appear to take a long time to return their leverage to its long-run mean or, loosely speaking, optimal level.

    "title": "Do Firms Respond to Gender Pay Gap",
    "abstract": "We examine the effect of pay transparency on the gender pay gap and ﬁrm outcomes. Using a 2006 legislation change in Denmark that requires ﬁrms to provide gender- disaggregated wage statistics, detailed employee-employer administrative data, and difference-in-differences and difference-in-discontinuities designs, we ﬁnd that the law reduces the gender pay gap, primarily by slowing wage growth for male em- ployees. The gender pay gap declines by 2 percentage points, or 13% relative to the prelegislation mean. Despite the reduction of the overall wage bill, the wage trans- parency mandate does not affect ﬁrm proﬁtability, likely because of the offsetting effect of reduced ﬁrm productivity. Gender PAY Disparities Characterize Labor markets in most developed countries (Goldin (2014), Blau and Kahn (2017)). When a man earns $100, a woman earns $77 in the United States (Goldin (2014)), $78.5 in Germany, $79 in the United Kingdom, and $83.8, on average, across EU countries (Eurostat (2016)).

    "abstract": "We model fund turnover in the presence of time-varying proﬁt opportunities. Our model predicts a positive relation between an active fund’s turnover and its sub- sequent benchmark-adjusted return. We ﬁnd such a relation for equity mutual funds. This time-series relation between turnover and performance is stronger than the cross-sectional relation, as the model predicts. Also as predicted, the turnover- performance relation is stronger for funds trading less-liquid stocks and funds likely to possess greater skill. Turnover is correlated across funds. The common component of turnover is positively correlated with proxies for stock mispricing. Turnover of similar funds helps predict a fund’s performance.

    "title": "Do Hedge Fund Managers Misreport Returns?",
    "abstract": "We find a significant discontinuity in the pooled distribution of monthly hedge fund returns: The number of small gains far exceeds the number of small losses. The dis- continuity is present in live and defunct funds, and funds of all ages, suggesting that it is not caused by database biases. The discontinuity is absent in the 3 months culminating in an audit, suggesting it is not attributable to skillful loss avoidance. The discontinuity disappears when using bimonthly returns, indicating a reversal in fund performance following small gains. This result suggests that the discontinuity is caused at least in part by temporarily overstated returns. IN June 2007, two Bear Stearns hedge funds with large positions in subprime mortgage-related instruments collapsed, precipitating a crisis in credit mar- kets. Barclays Bank, the sole investor in one of the funds, filed a lawsuit in December 2007, claiming that Bear Stearns fraudulently misrepresented the value of the fund’s assets. The episode illustrates the discretion available to hedge fund managers when valuing illiquid securities in their portfolios, and the ability of managers to temporarily conceal losses. 1 While isolated cases of hedge fund fraud have surfaced in recent years, it is unclear whether purposeful misreporting is widespread. We investigate the prevalence of misreporting in the hedge fund industry by studying a discontinuity in the distribution of monthly hedge fund returns, pooled across funds and over time. Dis",

    "abstract": "I examine how strong corporate governance proxied by the threat of hostile takeovers affects innovation and ﬁrm value. I ﬁnd a signiﬁcant decline in the number of patents and citations per patent for ﬁrms incorporated in states that pass antitakeover laws relative to ﬁrms incorporated in states that do not. Most of the impact of antitakeover laws on innovation occurs 2 or more years after they are passed, indicating a causal effect. The negative effect of antitakeover laws is mitigated by the presence of alter- native governance mechanisms such as large shareholders, pension fund ownership, leverage, and product market competition. There HAS Been A long-standing debate about the role of capital markets in promoting economic growth. While a positive relation has been theoretically argued and cross country empirical evidence has been provided (e.g., Beck, Levine, and Loayaza (2000), and Bekaert, Harvey, and Lundblad (2005)), the exact channel and the direction of causality have been more difﬁcult to estab- lish. Developed capital markets can promote economic growth via at least two channels: by alleviating ﬁnancial constraints and ﬁnancing proﬁtable projects that otherwise would not be ﬁnanced, and by providing the right incentives to managers through their monitoring and disciplining mechanisms. While the role of the ﬁrst channel is relatively straightforward, the second channel is more controversial. Holmstrom (1989) famously argues that capital markets, by pressuring top man",

    "abstract": "We investigate how the deterioration of household balance sheets affects worker pro- ductivity, and in turn economic downturns. Speciﬁcally, we compare the output of in- novative workers who experienced differential declines in housing wealth during the ﬁnancial crisis but were employed at the same ﬁrm and lived in the same metropoli- tan area. We ﬁnd that, following a negative wealth shock, innovative workers become less productive and generate lower economic value for their ﬁrms. The reduction in innovative output is not driven by workers switching to less innovative ﬁrms or po- sitions. These effects are more pronounced among workers at greater risk of ﬁnan- cial distress. Over THE Past Several Decades , the annual proportion of households in the United States experiencing a severe economic loss has been steadily increasing, peaking with the recent ﬁnancial crisis (Hacker et al.

    "abstract": "Using a novel data set covering all individual investors’ stock market transactions in Norway over 10 years, we analyze whether individual investors have a preference for professionally close stocks, and whether they make excess returns on such in- vestments. After excluding own-company stock holdings, investors hold 11% of their portfolio in stocks within their two-digit industry of employment. Given the poor hedging properties of such investments, one would expect abnormally high returns. In contrast, all estimates of abnormal returns are negative, in many cases statisti- cally signiﬁcant. Overconﬁdence seems the most likely explanation for the excessive trading in professionally close stocks. AS Time Goes ON , I get more and more convinced that the right method in investments is to put fairly large sums into enterprises which one thinks one knows something about and in management of which one thoroughly believes. It is a mistake to think that one limits one’s risks by spreading too much between enterprises about which one knows little and has no special reason for special conﬁdence. One’s knowledge and experience is deﬁnitely limited and there are seldom more than two or three enterprises at any given time which I personally feel myself entitled to put full conﬁdence.

In addition, we find that the probability of switching underwrit- ers between IPO and seasoned equity offering is negatively related to the unexpected amount of post-IPO analyst coverage.

    "abstract": "If ind that the market reaction to a merger and acquisition (M&A) announcement predicts whether the companies later consummate the deal. The relation cannot be explained by the market’s anticipation of the closing decision or its perception of the deal quality at the announcement. Merging companies appear to extract information from the market reaction and later consider it in closing the deal. Furthermore, the relation varies with deal characteristics, suggesting that companies seem to have a higher incentive to learn from the market when canceling the announced deal is easier or when the market has more information that the companies do not know. Imagine After Private Negotiations, the CEOs of two companies conclude that a merger will create value. They then reach a deal and announce it to the public. Outside investors, however, disagree with the proposed merger after being in- formed. They believe that the managers have overlooked certain weaknesses of the plan, and if carried out, it will reduce the total value of the two companies. The investors express their opposition in many ways, including trading down the companies’ stock prices. What do the managers do in such a situation? Do they ignore the market and consummate the merger anyway, or do they learn from the market and cancel the deal?

    "abstract": "Poor ﬁnancial health of intermediaries coincides with low asset prices and high risk premiums. Is this because intermediaries matter for asset prices, or because their health correlates with economy-wide risk aversion? In the ﬁrst case, return pre- dictability should be more pronounced for asset classes in which households are less active. We provide evidence supporting this prediction, suggesting that a quantita- tively sizable fraction of risk premium variation in several large asset classes such as credit or mortgage-backed securities (MBS) is due to intermediaries. Movements in economy-wide risk aversion create the opposite pattern, and we ﬁnd this channel also matters. Poor Financial Health OF Financial intermediaries such as investment banks, commercial banks, or hedge funds tends to coincide with low aggregate asset prices and high-risk premia.1 This correlation suggests that the health of the ﬁnancial sector matters for aggregate asset prices.2 However, this evidence alone does not rule out the possibility that intermediaries reﬂect or are corre- lated with other frictionless factors driving asset prices. For example, consider the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis, during which risk premia rose substantially. While there was indeed a decline in intermediary risk-bearing capacity, household risk aversion likely also rose, in which case the extent to which the fall in Valentin Haddad and Tyler Muir are with Ucla and Nber.

    "abstract": "We find a strong positive link between past IPO returns and future subscriptions at the investor level in Finland. Our setting allows us to trace this effect to the returns personally experienced by investors; the effect is not explained by patterns related to the IPO cycle, or wealth effects. This behavior is consistent with reinforcement learn- ing, where personally experienced outcomes are overweighted compared to rational Bayesian learning. The results provide a microfoundation for the argument that in- vestor sentiment drives IPO demand. The paper also contributes to understanding how popular investment styles develop, and has implications for the marketing of financial products. What CAN AN Investor Learn from personal experimentation with stocks? For experience goods such as wine, experimentation is essential: Product informa- tion and reviews can help to some extent, but ultimately one must consume the product to evaluate the utility it gives (see Nelson (1970)). Experimenta- tion is also important when it is a prerequisite for acquiring information (e.g., Grossman, Kihlstrom, and Mirman (1977)). However, stocks lack the aforemen- tioned characteristics, at least in traditional thinking. Therefore, whether one personally invests in a stock or merely observes the performance of a stock should not matter. The impact of personally experienced investment outcomes on future actions tells us something important about how investors learn, as it represents a key distinction b",

    "title": "Do Limit Orders Alter Inferences about Investor",
    "abstract": "Individual investors lose money around earnings announcements, experience poor posttrade returns, exhibit the disposition effect, and make contrarian trades. Using simulations and trading records of all individual investors in Finland, I ﬁnd that these trading patterns can be explained in large part by investors’ use of limit orders. These patterns arise mechanically because limit orders are price-contingent and suffer from adverse selection. Reverse causality from behavioral biases to order choices does not appear to explain my ﬁndings. I propose a simple method for measuring a data set’s susceptibility to this limit order effect. IN This Paper, I show that the use of limit orders signiﬁcantly alters inferences about individuals’ trading intentions and investment abilities. This “limit order effect” arises because a limit order executes only if the price moves against the order. Further, limit orders alter inferences about investors’ trading abilities due to limit orders’ exposure to adverse selection risk. I measure the signiﬁcance of the limit order effect by reexamining four in- dividual investor trading patterns, namely, individual investors’ tendency to misinterpret new information, show poor stock-picking skills, exhibit the dis- position effect, and make contrarian trades. Using simulations, I show that, even if investors decide randomly what to buy and sell, investors’ reliance on limit orders creates the appearance that they follow speciﬁc trading rules. I simulate",

    "title": "Do Market Prices Improve the Accuracy of Court",
    "abstract": "The average difference between the court value and postemergence market value of newly issued stocks in Chapter 11 reorganizations exceeds 50%. We show that pub- lic dissemination of transactions in defaulted bonds reduces this difference by 23% and largely eliminates interclaimant wealth transfers. The effects of dissemination are only signiﬁcant when the bonds are sufﬁciently traded around the court valua- tion date and when they receive signiﬁcant amounts of postemergence equity, indi- cating that the bond’s value is sensitive to the size and allocation of the pie. These ﬁndings imply that security prices have real effects: they improve the valuations of bankruptcy participants. A Large Body OF Literature Emphasizes the role of security prices in aggregating and disseminating market information and thereby guiding eco- nomic and ﬁnancial decisions.1 This has led to the creation of markets solely for the purpose of assimilating different views ahead of making ﬁnal pricing deci- sions. For example, pre-IPO grey markets have been established to reduce un- certainty about a company’s valuation and improve pricing efﬁciency of IPOs (Chang et al. (2017)). Market prices are also used as reference points in merg- ers (Baker, Pan, and Wurgler (2012)) and have been proposed by resolution referees for very helpful comments that substantially improved the paper.

    "abstract": "Municipal bonds exhibit considerable retail pricing variation, even for same-size trades of the same bond on the same day, and even from the same dealer. Markups vary widely across dealers. Trading strongly clusters on eighth price increments, and clustered trades exhibit higher markups. Yields are often lowered to just above salient numbers. Machine learning estimates exploiting the richness of the data show that dealers that use strategic pricing have systematically higher markups.

    "title": "Do Peer Firms Affect Corporate Financial Policy?",
    "abstract": "We show that peer ﬁrms play an important role in determining corporate capital structures and ﬁnancial policies. In large part, ﬁrms’ ﬁnancing decisions are responses to the ﬁnancing decisions and, to a lesser extent, the characteristics of peer ﬁrms. These peer effects are more important for capital structure determination than most previously identiﬁed determinants. Furthermore, smaller, less successful ﬁrms are highly sensitive to their larger, more successful peers, but not vice versa. We also quantify the externalities generated by peer effects, which can amplify the impact of changes in exogenous determinants on leverage by over 70%. Choices are made independently of the actions or characteristics of their peers. In other words, a ﬁrm’s capital structure is typically assumed to be determined as a function of its marginal tax rate, expected deadweight loss in default, information environment, and incentive structure. As such, the role for peer ﬁrm behavior in affecting capital structure is often ignored, or at most im- plicitly assumed to operate through its unmeasured impact on ﬁrm-speciﬁc determinants. However, peer ﬁrms play a central role in shaping a number of corporate policies, and existing evidence suggests that the behavior of peer ﬁrms may matter for capital structure. 1 Survey evidence indicates that a signiﬁcant Daniel Bergstresser, Philip Bond, Murray Frank, Ken French, Itay Goldstein, Robin Greenwood, Richard Kihlstrom, Jiro Kondo, Arvind Krishnamurthy, Cam",

    "abstract": "We examine the effects of physiology and spiritual sentiment on economic decision- making in the context of Ramadan, an entire lunar month of daily fasting and in- creased spiritual reﬂection in the Muslim faith. Using an administrative data set of bank loans originated in Turkey during 2003 to 2013, we ﬁnd that small business loans originated during Ramadan are 15% more likely to default within two years of origination. Loans originated in hot Ramadans, when adverse physiological effects of fasting are greatest, and those approved by the busiest bank branches perform worse. Despite their worse performance, Ramadan loans have lower credit spreads. Many Business Decisions Require THE subjective judgment of managers and thus provide fertile ground for understanding the role of psychological and physiological factors in economic decision-making. While a large body of of sentiment shocks to shed light on cognitive biases, sentiment shocks induced by spiritual activities remain largely unexplored in the literature.

    "title": "Do Portfolio Manager Contracts Contract",
    "abstract": "Most mutual fund managers have performance-based contracts. Our theory predicts that mutual fund managers with asymmetric contracts and mid-year performance close to their announced benchmark increase their portfolio risk in the second part of the year. As predicted by our theory, performance deviation from the benchmark decreases risk-shifting only for managers with performance contracts. Deviation from the benchmark dominates incentives from the ﬂow-performance relation, suggesting that risk-shifting is motivated more by management contracts than by a tournament to capture ﬂows. Contracting Theory Asserts THATinvestors can mitigate agency problems by requiring high-incentive contracts for managers. In the context of delegated portfolio management, in principle these contracts align managers’ payoffs more closely with their performance, increasing their effort and leading to superior performance for investors. However, Hart (2017) points out that man- agers have residual control rights over the assets of a portfolio, that is, contracts do not dictate portfolio choices because many choices are not observable. The economic reality of residual control by the portfolio manager creates incentives that are seldom discussed in the context of optimal contracts. This motivates us to study the contracts between the investment advisor and mutual fund man- agers and focus on one ramiﬁcation of these contracts: mid-year risk-shifting.

    "title": "Do Price Discreteness and Transactions Costs Affect",
    "abstract": "By the end of January 2001, all Nyse stocks had converted their price quota- tions from l/8s and l/16s to decimals. This study examines the effect of this change in price quotations on ex-dividend day activity. We find that abnormal ex-dividend day returns increase in the 1/16 and decimal pricing eras, relative to the 1/8 era, which is inconsistent with microstructure explanations of ex- day price movements. We also find that abnormal returns increase in conjunc- tion with a May 1997 reduction in the capital gains tax rate, as they should if relative taxation of dividends and capital gains affects ex-day pricing. If capital markets were perfect, a stock's price would fall by the amount of the dividend on the ex-day. Instead, the ratio of price drop to dividend, known as the ex-day premium, has been consistently below one for decades (e.g., Elton and Gruber (1970), Michaely (1991), or Eades, Hess and Kim (1994)). Several lines of reasoning have developed to explain the ex-day phenomenon: (1) differential taxation between dividends and capital gains, (2) the interaction of taxes and transactions costs to trading stocks, and (3) price discreteness and bid-ask bounce. U.S. Markets during the past half-dozen years offer a natural experiment to test these hypotheses. During this time, price discreteness and bid-ask spreads fell dramatically, allowing us to test the microstructure-based explanations. At the same time, the capital gains tax rate dropped from 28% to 20%, which per- mi",

    "title": "Do Prices Reveal the Presence of Informed",
    "abstract": "Using a comprehensive sample of trades from Schedule 13D ﬁlings by activist in- vestors, we study how measures of adverse selection respond to informed trading. We ﬁnd that on days when activists accumulate shares, measures of adverse selection and of stock illiquidity are lower, even though prices are positively impacted. Two channels help explain this phenomenon: (1) activists select times of higher liquidity when they trade, and (2) activists use limit orders. We conclude that, when informed traders can select when and how to trade, standard measures of adverse selection may fail to capture the presence of informed trading. An extensive body of theory suggests that stock illiquidity, as measured by the bid-ask spread and by the price impact of trades, should be increas- ing in the information asymmetry between market participants (Glosten and Milgrom (1985), Kyle (1985), Easley and O’Hare (1987)). Based on this liter- ature, there have been many attempts to measure trading costs empirically, and to decompose such costs into different components such as adverse selec- tion, order processing, and inventory costs (Glosten (1987), Glosten and Harris (1988), Stoll (1989), Hasbrouck (1991a)).

    "abstract": "We study how listing status affects investment behavior. Theory offers competing hy- potheses on how listing-related frictions affect investment decisions. We use detailed data on 74,670 individual projects in the U.S. Natural gas industry to show that pri- vate ﬁrms respond less than public ﬁrms to changes in investment opportunities. Private ﬁrms adjust drilling activity for low capital-intensity investments. However, they do not increase drilling in response to new capital-intensive growth opportu- nities. Instead, they sell these projects to public ﬁrms. Our evidence suggests that differences in access to external capital are important in explaining the investment behavior of public and private ﬁrms. Understanding When AND WHY Listing status affects investment decisions is important due to the large role of private ﬁrms in the U.S. Economy.1 Public ﬁrms have better access to external ﬁnancing than private ﬁrms.2 This im- proved access to capital markets could make public ﬁrms more responsive to new investment opportunities.

    "title": "Do Professional Traders Exhibit Myopic Loss",
    "abstract": "Two behavioral concepts, loss aversion and mental accounting, have been combined to provide a theoretical explanation of the equity premium puzzle. Recent experimental evidence supports the theory, as students’ behavior has been found to be consistent with myopic loss aversion (MLA). Yet, much like certain anomalies in the realm of riskless decision-making, these behavioral tendencies may be attenuated among pro- fessionals. Using traders recruited from the Cbot, we do indeed find behavioral dif- ferences between professionals and students, but rather than discovering that the anomaly is muted, we find that traders exhibit behavior consistent with MLA to a greater extent than students. ONE Mainstay Among Economists IStheir fascination with anomalies and unsolved puzzles. Arguably one of the most provocative enigmas in recent years is the eq- uity premium puzzle: Given the return of stocks and bonds over the last century, an unreasonably high level of risk aversion would be necessary to explain why investors are willing to hold bonds at all (Mehra and Prescott (1985)). Recently, Benartzi and Thaler (1995) combined two behavioral concepts—loss aversion (Kahneman and Tversky (1979)) and mental accounting (Thaler (1985))—to provide a theoretical foundation for the observed equity premium puzzle. While only a few experimental studies have tested Benartzi and Thaler’s myopic loss aversion (MLA) theory, the results thus far have been quite promising, as Thaler et al. (1997), Gneezy",

    "title": "Do Rare Events Explain CDX Tranche Spreads?",
    "abstract": "We investigate whether a model with time-varying probability of economic disaster can explain prices of collateralized debt obligations. We focus on senior tranches of the CDX, an index of credit default swaps on investment grade ﬁrms. These assets do not incur losses until a large fraction of previously stable ﬁrms default, and thus are deep out-of-the money put options on the overall economy. When calibrated to consumption data and to the equity premium, the model explains the spreads on CDX tranches prior to and during the 2008 to 2009 crisis. The period from 2005 to September of 2008 witnessed a more than 100-fold increase in the cost of insuring against economic catastrophe. This cost is apparent in the pricing of derivative contracts written on the CDX, an index of credit default swaps on investment-grade ﬁrms. During the 2005 to 2009 period, tranches on the CDX were actively traded, with investors purchasing and selling insurance that would pay off only if a certain fraction of ﬁrms represented by the CDX went into default. The most senior tranches were structured to pay off only if corporate defaults became extremely widespread— more so than during the Great Depression. These senior tranches, which can be viewed as extremely deep out-of-the-money options, are nonredundant assets whose prices uniquely reﬂect the probability that investors place on an extreme state of the world. While the costs of insuring senior tranches on the CDX were close to zero through most of 20",

Porting the wealth expropriation hypothesis. Using a larger sample with com- prehensive bond data, we find evidence consistent with wealth expropriation. Bondholders, on average, suffer a significant negative abnormal return during the month of the spin-off announcement. However, even accounting for the loss to the bondholders, the aggregate value of the publicly traded debt and equity increases on a spin-off announcement, suggesting that the wealth expropria- tion hypothesis is not a complete explanation of the stockholder gains. In ex- plaining the magnitude of the losses to bondholders, we find they are a function of the loss in collateral in the spun-off subsidiary and the level of fi- nancial risk of the parent firm. Consistent with a loss to bondholders, firms are more likely to have their credit rating downgraded than upgraded after a spin- off. Additionally, consistent with the wealth transfer hypothesis, losses to bondholders tend to be more severe, the larger the gains to shareholders.

    "title": "Do Stock Mergers Create Value for Acquirers?",
    "abstract": "This paper finds support for the hypothesis that overvalued firms create value for long-term shareholders by using their equity as currency. Any approach centered on abnormal returns is complicated by the fact that the most overvalued firms have the greatest incentive to engage in stock acquisitions. We solve this endogeneity problem by creating a sample of mergers that fail for exogenous reasons. We find that unsuc- cessful stock bidders significantly underperform successful ones. Failure to consum- mate is costlier for richly priced firms, and the unrealized acquirer-target combination would have earned higher returns. None of these results hold for cash bids. THE Late 1990S Witnessed a large mergers and acquisitions wave. Many transac- tions involved equity as the mode of payment (Andrade, Mitchell, and Stafford (2001), Holmstrom and Kaplan (2001)), and this equity was usually very richly valued by historical standards. The positive correlation between market valu- ation and merger activity has also been documented in other periods (Martin (1996), Verter (2002)) and is especially strong for stock deals (Maksimovic and Phillips (2001)). One interpretation of this evidence is that managers try to time the market by paying with stock when they believe it is overvalued. Recently, a number of papers formally recognized this link between possible mispricing and acquisition activity. Shleifer and Vishny (2003) propose that overvalued firms engage in stock-financed acquisitions in",

    "abstract": "This paper examines the empirical performance of jump diffusion models of stock price dynamics from joint options and stock markets data. The paper introduces a model with discontinuous correlated jumps in stock prices and stock price volatility, and with state-dependent arrival intensity. We discuss how to perform likelihood- based inference based upon joint options/returns data and present estimates of risk premiums for jump and volatility risks. The paper finds that while complex jump specifications add little explanatory power in fitting options data, these models fare better in fitting options and returns data simultaneously. THE Statistical Properties of stock returns have long been of interest to finan- cial decision makers and academics alike. In particular, the great stock market crashes of the 20th century pose particular challenges to economic and statisti- cal models. In the past decades, there have been elaborate efforts by researchers to build models that explicitly allow for large market movements, or “fat tails” in return distributions. The literature has mainly focused on two approaches: (1) time-varying volatility models that allow for market extremes to be the out- come of normally distributed shocks that have a randomly changing variance, and (2) models that incorporate discontinuous jumps in the asset price. Neither stochastic volatility models nor jump models have alone proven en- tirely empirically successful. For example, in the time-series literature,",

    "abstract": "In the presence of frictions, firms adjust their capital structure infrequently. As a consequence, in a dynamic economy the leverage of most firms is likely to differ from the “optimum” leverage at the time of readjustment. This paper explores the empirical implications of this observation. I use a calibrated dynamic trade-off model to simulate firms’ capital structure paths. The results of standard cross-sectional tests on these data are consistent with those reported in the empirical literature. In particular, the standard interpretation of some test results leads to the rejection of the underlying model. Taken together, the results suggest a rethinking of the way capital structure tests are conducted. Cross section of leverage to discriminate between various theories of financing ity, book-to-market, and firm size. Changes in market leverage are largely ex- plained by changes in equity value. Past book-to-market ratios predict current capital structure. Firms seem to use debt financing too conservatively, and the leverage of stable, profitable firms appears particularly low. Even if firms have a target level of leverage, they move toward it slowly. Firms with low leverage react differently to external economic shocks from firms with high leverage.

Female clients who signaled high conﬁ- dence, high risk tolerance, or a domestic outlook were especially likely to receive this suboptimal advice.

    "abstract": "The Fama–French factors HML and SMB are correlated with innovations in variables that describe investment opportunities. A model that includes shocks to the aggregate dividend yield and term spread, default spread, and one-month Treasury-bill yield explains the cross section of average returns better than the Fama–French model. When loadings on the innovations in the predictive variables are present in the model, loadings on HML and SMB lose their explanatory power for the cross section of returns. The results are consistent with an Icapm explanation for the empirical success of the Fama–French portfolios. IN A Series OF Papers , Fama and French (1993, 1995, 1996) (FF hereafter) show that a three-factor model explains most of the cross-sectional variation in average returns of portfolios sorted by size and book-to-market. The three factors are the excess return of the market portfolio (R M), the return of a portfolio long in high book-to-market stocks and short in low book-to-market stocks (R HML), and the return of a portfolio long in small stocks and short in big stocks (rsmb). The impressive performance of the FF three-factor model has spurred an enthusiastic debate in the finance literature over the economic interpretation of the HML and SMB factors. Among the many competing explanations behind the success of the FF model is the one based on time-varying investment oppor- tunities.

The New York Stock Exchange automated quote dissemination in 2003, and we use this change in market structure that increases AT as an exogenous instrument to measure the causal effect of AT on liquidity. For large stocks in particular, AT narrows spreads, reduces adverse selection, and reduces trade-related price discovery. The ﬁndings indicate that AT improves liquidity and enhances the informativeness of quotes. Technological Change HAS Revolutionized the way ﬁnancial assets are traded. Every step of the trading process, from order entry to trading venue to back ofﬁce, is now highly automated, dramatically reducing the costs incurred by intermediaries. By reducing the frictions and costs of trading, technology has the potential to enable more efﬁcient risk sharing, facilitate hedging, im- prove liquidity, and make prices more efﬁcient. This could ultimately reduce ﬁrms’ cost of capital. Algorithmic trading (AT) is a dramatic example of this far-reaching techno- logical change. Many market participants now employ AT, commonly deﬁned as the use of computer algorithms to automatically make certain trading de- cisions, submit orders, and manage those orders after submission. From a starting point near zero in the mid-1990s, AT is thought to be responsible for as much as 73 percent of trading volume in th",

    "abstract": "Term future outcomes. We show theoretically that the availability of short-term- oriented data can induce forecasters to optimally shift their attention from the long term to the short term because it reduces the cost of obtaining short-term informa- tion. Consequently, the informativeness of their long-term forecasts decreases, even though the informativeness of their short-term forecasts increases. We test and con- ﬁrm this prediction by considering how the informativeness of equity analysts’ fore- casts at various horizons varies over the long run and with their exposure to social media data.

    "title": "Does Borrowing from Banks Cost More than",
    "abstract": "This paper investigates the pricing of bank loans relative to capital market debt. The analysis uses a novel sample of loans matched with bond spreads from the same ﬁrm on the same date. After accounting for seniority, lenders earn a large premium relative to the bond-implied credit spread. In a sample of secured term loans to noninvestment- grade ﬁrms, the average premium is 140 to 170 bps or about half of the all-in-drawn spread. This is the ﬁrst direct evidence of ﬁrms’ willingness to pay for bank credit and raises questions about the nature of competition in the loan market. THE TWO Primary Sources OFdebt for ﬁrms are private bank loans and public bonds issued in the market. The academic literature offers a number of theories on the interaction between the private and public debt markets (e.g., Diamond (1991), Rajan (1992), Chemmanur and Fulghieri (1994)) and empirical evidence on cross-sectional and time series variation in the quantities of loans and bonds issued (e.g., Faulkender and Petersen (2006), Rauh and Suﬁ (2010), Becker and Ivashina (2014)). We know less, however, about the pricing of bank loans and the relative pricing of private and public debt. This paper ﬁlls that gap by offering new evidence on the relative costs of loan and bond debt. The central ﬁnding of this paper is that banks earn a substantial interest rate premium relative to the price of credit risk implied by the bond market after accounting for seniority. I arrive at this ﬁnding by constructing",

    "title": "Does Corporate Diversification",
    "abstract": "We analyze several hundred firms that expand via acquisition and/or increase their number of business segments. The combined market reaction to acquisition announcements is positive but acquiring firm excess values decline after the di- versifying event. Much of the excess value reduction occurs because our sample firms acquire already discounted business units, and not because diversifying de- stroys value. This implies that the standard assumption that conglomerate divi- sions can be benchmarked to typical stand-alone firms should be carefully reconsidered. We also show that excess value does not decline when firms increase their number of business segments because of pure reporting changes. Does Corporate Diversification destroy value? Several recent papers attempt to answer this question by comparing the market value of firms that operate multiple lines of business to the value of a portfolio of stand-alone firms operating in the same industries as the conglomerate's divisions. Lang and Stulz (1994) use this approach and find that multisegment firms have low values of Tobin's q compared to stand-alone firms. Similarly, Berger and Ofek (1995) find that U.S. Conglomerates are priced at a mean discount of about 15 percent. Lins and Servaes (1999) find similar discounts in Japan and the United Kingdom. Indeed, based on the Berger and Ofek methodol- ogy, diversified firms with valuation discounts had aggregate value losses of $800 billion in 1995. The magnitude of the value lo",

    "title": "Does Corporate Headquarters Location Matter",
    "abstract": "We document strong comovement in the stock returns of firms headquartered in the same geographic area. Moreover, stocks of companies that change their headquarters location experience a decrease in their comovement with stocks from the old location and an increase in their comovement with stocks from the new location. The local co- movement of stock returns is not explained by economic fundamentals and is stronger for smaller firms with more individual investors and in regions with less financially sophisticated residents. We argue that price formation in equity markets has a sig- nificant geographic component linked to the trading patterns of local residents. Financial Economists Document A Strong bias in the portfolio holdings of vari- ous classes of investors towards local companies. 1 However, researchers tend to disagree about the underlying reasons for such a bias with possible expla- nations varying from observational learning and the social interactions of in- vestors (e.g., Brown et al. (2004)) to asymmetric information (e.g., Coval and Moskowitz (2001)). Despite the increased interest in investors’ location-related preferences, the economic implication of locality for the pricing of publicly traded equity remains a largely unexplored question. If locality matters for asset pricing, then geography, in general, and the local bias, in particular, could have important implications for cost of capital calculations, performance eval- uations, and asset allocation decision",

    "title": "Does Credit Competition Affect",
    "abstract": "While relaxation of geographical restrictions on bank expansion permitted banking organizations to expand across state lines, it allowed states to erect barriers to branch expansion. These differences in states’ branching restrictions affect credit supply. In states more open to branching, small ﬁrms borrow at interest rates 80 to 100 basis points lower than ﬁrms operating in less open states. Firms in open states also are more likely to borrow from banks. Despite this evidence that interstate branch openness expands credit supply, we ﬁnd no effectof variation in state restrictions on branching on the amount that small ﬁrms borrow. Relaxation OF Geographical restrictions on bank expansion was completed in 1997, when the Interstate Banking and Branching Efﬁciency Act (ibbea) permitted banks and bank holding companies to expand across state lines. This legislation seemingly ended the era of geographical restrictions on bank expansion that date back to the 19th century (Kroszner and Strahan (2007)). In 1994, while most states allowed out-of-state bank holding companies to own in-state banks (interstate banking), there were almost no interstate branches. Ibbea, which was passed in 1994, allowed both unrestricted interstate bank- ing (effective in 1995) and interstate branching (in effect in 1997). Allowing interstate branching was the watershed event of Ibbea. However, the interstate branching provisions contained in Ibbea granted states the right to erect roadblocks to branch ex",

    "abstract": "The distance between small firms and their lenders is increasing, and they are communicating in more impersonal ways. After documenting these systematic changes, we demonstrate they do not arise from small firms locating differently, consolidation in the banking industry, or biases in the sample. Instead, improve- ments in lender productivity appear to explain our findings. We also find distant firms no longer have to be the highest quality credits, indicating they have greater access to credit. The evidence indicates there has been substantial development of the financial sector, even in areas such as small business lending. Small Business Lending HAS Historically been very costly, because of the pau- city of information about small firms and the high costs of the personnel required to obtain even that information. Information about small busi- nesses is thought to be \"soft,\" and has to be collected by lenders over time through relationships with firms (see Berger and Udell (1995), Petersen and Rajan (1994)).1 If these descriptions of small businesses are accurate, they have a number of implications. First, if a lender has to have direct contact with the small business to collect information about it, it has to have a local presence.

    "abstract": "Although algorithmic trading now dominates ﬁnancial markets, some exchanges con- tinue to use human ﬂoor traders. On March 23, 2020 the Nyse suspended ﬂoor trading because of Covid-19. Using a difference-in-differences analysis around the closure of the ﬂoor, we ﬁnd that ﬂoor traders are important contributors to market quality. The suspension of ﬂoor trading leads to higher spreads and larger pricing er- rors for treated stocks relative to control stocks. To explore the mechanism, we exploit two partial ﬂoor reopenings that have different characteristics. Our ﬁnding suggests that in-person human interaction facilitates the transfer of valuable information that algorithms lack. Since ITS Inception IN 1792, the New York Stock Exchange (nyse) has relied on ﬂoor traders—human beings who trade securities while standing on the ﬂoor of the exchange.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the effects of going public on innovation by comparing the innovation activity of ﬁrms that go public with ﬁrms that withdraw their initial public offering (IPO) ﬁling and remain private. Nasdaq ﬂuctuations during the book- building phase are used as an instrument for IPO completion. Using patent-based metrics, I ﬁnd that the quality of internal innovation declines following the IPO, and ﬁrms experience both an exodus of skilled inventors and a decline in the productivity of the remaining inventors. However, public ﬁrms attract new human capital and acquire external innovation. The analysis reveals that going public changes ﬁrms’ strategies in pursuing innovation.

This question is important given the critical role of innovation in promoting economic growth (Solow (1957)) and the prevalence of technological ﬁrms in the initial public examines the performance of ﬁrms around their IPO, little is known about the effects of going public on innovation. This paper’s main contribution is to show that going public affects three important dimensions of innovation activity: the creation of internally generated innovation, the productivity and mobility of individual inventors, and the acquisition of external innovation.

    "abstract": "We uncover a negative relation between herding behavior and skill in the mutual fund industry. Our new, dynamic measure of fund-level herding captures the tendency of fund managers to follow the trades of the institutional crowd. We ﬁnd that herd- ing funds underperform their antiherding peers by over 2% per year. Differences in skill drive this performance gap: Antiherding funds make superior investment deci- sions even on stocks not heavily traded by institutions, and can anticipate the trades of the crowd; furthermore, the herding-antiherding performance gap is persistent, wider when skill is more valuable, and larger among managers with stronger career concerns. Theories OF Herding Behavior Predict That people tend to “follow the crowd” for a variety of reasons, for instance, to appear as talented as others or to learn from others.1 One important yet underexplored feature of these models is the idea that less skilled individuals may herd on the decisions of their predecessors, while those with superior ability may be more likely to deviate from past actions—to the point of exhibiting antiherding behavior. Despite the rich implications of this intuition, however, there is little empirical evidence on the relationship between skill and the tendency to follow the crowd. In this paper, we investigate the link between herding behavior and skill in the context of the mutual fund industry, which is an ideal setting to study the relation between herding and skill for two reasons.",

    "abstract": "Goyal and Santa-Clara (2003) find a significantly positive relation between the equal- weighted average stock volatility and the value-weighted portfolio returns on the NYSE/AMEX/Nasdaq stocks for the period of 1963:08 to 1999:12. We show that this result is driven by small stocks traded on the Nasdaq, and is in part due to a liquidity premium. In addition, their result does not hold for the extended sample of 1963:08 to 2001:12 and for the Nyse/amex and Nyse stocks. More importantly, we find no evidence of a significant link between the value-weighted portfolio returns and the median and value-weighted average stock volatility. THE Intertemporal Relation Between Risk AND Return has long been an impor- tant topic in asset pricing literature. Most asset pricing models postulate a positive relationship between a stock portfolio’s expected returns and risk, which is often modeled by the variance or standard deviation of the portfo- lio’s returns. However, there is no agreement about the existence of such a trade-off for stock market indices. 1 While return volatility is an intuitively appealing measure of risk, different approaches used by previous researchers suggest that no clear consensus has emerged regarding its relevance. 2 Whether or not investors require a larger risk premium on average for investing in a security during times when the security is more risky remains an open question.

    "abstract": "Prior studies ﬁnd that a strategy that buys high-beta stocks and sells low-beta stocks has a signiﬁcantly negative unconditional capital asset pricing model (capm) alpha, such that it appears to pay to “bet against beta.” We show, however, that the condi- tional beta for the high-minus-low beta portfolio covaries negatively with the equity premium and positively with market volatility. As a result, the unconditional alpha is a downward-biased estimate of the true alpha. We model the conditional market risk for beta-sorted portfolios using instrumental variables methods and ﬁnd that the conditional Capm resolves the beta anomaly. THE Sharpe-lintner Capital asset pricing model (capm) implies that expo- sure to market risk, as measured by beta, should be compensated by the mar- ket risk premium. Based on the performance of portfolios formed on lagged ﬁrm-level beta, however, a number of empirical studies ﬁnd that the risk- reward relation is too ﬂat. For example, Friend and Blume ( 1970) and Black, Jensen, and Scholes ( 1972) demonstrate that portfolios of high-beta stocks earn lower returns than implied by the Capm and therefore have negative alphas, whereas portfolios of low-beta stocks earn positive alphas. Fama and French (1992, 2006) extend these results by showing that the beta-return relation be- comes even ﬂatter after controlling for size and book-to-market characteristics.

    "abstract": "This paper examines the relation between net buying pressure and the shape of the implied volatility function (IVF) for index and individual stock options. We find that changes in implied volatility are directly related to net buying pressure from public order flow. We also find that changes in implied volatility of S&P 500 options are most strongly affected by buying pressure for index puts, while changes in implied volatility of stock options are dominated by call option demand. Simulated delta-neutral option- writing trading strategies generate abnormal returns that match the deviations of the IVFs above realized historical return volatilities. If people are willing to pay foolish prices for insurance, why shouldn’t we sell it to them? (Lowenstein (2000)). ONE OF THE Most Intriguing Anomalies Reported in the derivatives literature is the “implied volatility smile.” The name arose from the fact that, prior to the October 1987 market crash, the relation between the Black and Scholes (1973) implied volatility of S&P 500 index options and exercise price gave the ap- pearance of a smile. Since October 1987, however, the index implied volatility function (hereafter, IVF), as we refer to it, decreases monotonically across exer- cise prices. Under the assumptions of the Black–Scholes model, the IVF should be flat and constant through time. Most attempts to explain the shape of the IVF focus on relaxing the Black– Scholes assumption of constant volatility by allowing the local vola",

    "title": "Does Poor Performance Damage the Reputation",
    "abstract": "We investigate the effect of poor performance on ﬁnancial intermediary reputation by estimating the effect of large-scale bankruptcies among a lead arranger’s borrowers on its subsequent syndication activity. Consistent with reputation damage, such lead arrangers retain larger fractions of the loans they syndicate, are less likely to syn- dicate loans, and are less likely to attract participant lenders. The consequences are more severe when borrower bankruptcies suggest inadequate screening or monitor- ing by the lead arranger. However, the effect of borrower bankruptcies on syndication activity is not present among dominant lead arrangers, and is weak in years in which many lead arrangers experience borrower bankruptcies. Investors Delegate THE Task of screening and monitoring ﬁrms to special- ized ﬁnancial intermediaries such as banks and underwriters (Leland and Pyle (1977) and Diamond (1984)). A downside to such delegation is that it can introduce a layer of information and incentive problems between ﬁnancial intermediaries and investors. A large theoretical literature on the role of repu- tation suggests that an intermediary’s concern with maintaining its reputation for diligent screening and monitoring will mitigate such agency problems. The intermediary knows that poor performance on its part will hurt its reputation and lead to loss of future economic rents. 1 Despite the importance of this ar- gument, there is little direct empirical evidence on whether poor performa",

    "abstract": "We derive a behavioral measure of the IPO decision-maker’s satisfaction with the un- derwriter’s performance based on Loughran and Ritter (2002) and assess its ability to explain the decision-maker’s choice among underwriters in subsequent securities offerings. Controlling for other known factors, IPO firms are less likely to switch underwriters when our behavioral measure indicates they were satisfied with the IPO underwriter’s performance. Underwriters also extract higher fees for subsequent transactions involving satisfied decision-makers. Although our tests suggest that the behavioral model has explanatory power, they do not speak directly to whether devi- ations from expected utility maximization determine patterns in IPO initial returns. THE Primary Equity (OR IPO) Markets are subject to a variety of well-known id- iosyncratic patterns, not least the tendency for IPOs to appear underpriced on the first day of trading. The profession has invested heavily in explanations for these patterns (see Ritter and Welch (2002) and Jenkinson and Ljungqvist (2001) for recent reviews). The vast majority of theoretical work in the area builds (at least implicitly) on the premise that market participants are ratio- nal and maximize expected utility subject to the burden of market frictions.

    "abstract": "We examine the role of reputation in limiting opportunistic behavior by venture capitalists towards four types of counterparties: entrepreneurs, investors, other VCs, and buyers of VC-backed startups. Using a hand-collected database of lawsuits, we document that more reputable VCs (i.e., VCs that are older, have more deals and funds under management, and syndicate with larger networks of VCs) are less likely to be litigated. We also ﬁnd that litigated VCs suffer declines in future business relative to matched peers. These declines are larger for more reputable VCs, and for VCs that are defendants to multiple lawsuits or sued by entrepreneurs.

    "title": "Does Shareholder Composition Matter? Evidence",
    "abstract": "We examine whether institutional ownership composition is related to para- meters of the market reaction to negative earnings announcements. When firms report earnings below analysts' expectations, the stock price response is more negative for firms with higher levels of ownership by momentum or aggressive growth investors. There is no evidence, however, that these institu- tions cause an \"overreaction\" to earnings news. Ownership structure is also related to trading volume and to stock price volatility on days around earnings announcements. Our findings are consistent with the idea that the composi- tion of institutional shareholders effects stock price behavior around the release of corporate information. Institutional Ownership OF U.S. Equities has increased dramatically during the past two decades. This rise has led to much debate concerning the impact of trad- ing by institutional investors on stock prices. At one extreme, institutional inves- tors are viewed as causing stock prices to deviate from fundamental values and causing excess volatility.1 At the other, institutions are seen to increase firm value via their monitoring capabilities.2 Empirically, the broad goal of our re- search is to understand whether and how the identity of a firm's institutional shareholders matters. In this paper, we examine the relation between the composition of firms' insti- tutional ownership and parameters of the market reaction to negative earnings announcements.3 We focus on corporate",

    "abstract": "We aim to tackle the longstanding debate on whether stock liquidity enhances or impedes ﬁrm innovation. This topic is of interest because innovation is crucial for ﬁrm- and national-level competitiveness and stock liquidity can be altered by ﬁnan- cial market regulations. Using a difference-in-differences approach that relies on the exogenous variation in liquidity generated by regulatory changes, we ﬁnd that an increase in liquidity causes a reduction in future innovation. We identify two possi- ble mechanisms through which liquidity impedes innovation: increased exposure to hostile takeovers and higher presence of institutional investors who do not actively gather information or monitor. Innovation PRODUCTIVITYis of interest to a large number of stakeholders includ- ing ﬁrm managers, employees, investors, and regulators. As Porter (1992, p. 65) states, “To compete effectively in international markets, a nation’s businesses must continuously innovate and upgrade their competitive advantages. Inno- vation and upgrading come from sustained investment in physical as well as in- tangible assets.” Given the importance of innovation for ﬁrm- and national-level competitiveness, investigation into factors that increase or decrease innovation is warranted. There has been much debate on whether stock liquidity enhances or impedes innovation. This topic is of particular interest to regulators, since stock liquidity can be altered by changing ﬁnancial market regulations and securities l",

    "abstract": "Does the “smart money” effect documented by Gruber (1996) and Zheng (1999) reflect fund selection ability of mutual fund investors? We examine the finding that investors are able to predict mutual fund performance and invest accordingly. We show that the smart money effect is explained by the stock return momentum phenomenon documented by Jegadeesh and Titman (1993). Further evidence suggests investors do not select funds based on a momentum investing style, but rather simply chase funds that were recent winners. Our finding that a common factor in stock returns explains the smart money effect offers no affirmation of investor fund selection ability. DO Investors Make Smart Choices when selecting mutual funds? Studies by Gruber (1996) and Zheng (1999) suggest that investors have selection ability, a finding that has been dubbed the “smart money” effect. Using a sample of 227 stock mutual funds during the period 1985–1994, Gruber (1996) shows that the risk-adjusted return on new cash flows to funds is higher than the average re- turn for all investors in the funds. Subsequent work by Zheng (1999) analyzes a sample of 1,826 stock mutual funds during the period 1970–1993 and also finds that the short-term performance of funds that experience positive new money flow is significantly better than those that experience negative new money flow. One possible explanation for the smart money effect is that investors base their investment decisions on fund-specific information, or in oth",

    "title": "Does Weak Governance Cause Weak Stock",
    "abstract": "We investigate Gompers, Ishii, and Metrick’s (2003) finding that firms with weak shareholder rights exhibit significant stock market underperformance. If the relation between poor governance and poor returns is causal, we expect that the market is negatively surprised by the poor operating performance of weak governance firms. We find that firms with weak shareholder rights exhibit significant operating under- performance. However, analysts’ forecast errors and earnings announcement returns show no evidence that this underperformance surprises the market. Our results are robust to controls for takeover activity. Overall, our results do not support the hypoth- esis that weak governance causes poor stock returns. Whether Corporate Governance Affects Firm Performance is a matter of much study and debate. In an important and widely cited recent paper, Gompers, Ishii, and Metrick (GIM, 2003) find for the period 1990 to 1999 that firms with strong shareholder rights have risk-adjusted stock returns that are 8.5% higher per year than those of firms with weak shareholder rights. A puzzling feature of the paper is that the authors find persistent stock market underperformance for firms with weak shareholder rights, but they do not find significant underper- formance in firm operating performance, which they measure with accounting return on equity. 1 This lack of operating underperformance is surprising, given comments from Gus De Franco, Ted Goodman, David Larcker, Dawn Matsumoto, An",

    "title": "Does a Parent–Subsidiary Structure Enhance",
    "abstract": "I examine whether firms exploit a publicly traded parent–subsidiary structure to issue equity of the overvalued firm regardless of which firm needs funds, and whether this conveys opposite information about firm values. Using 90 subsidiary and 37 parent seasoned equity offering (SEO) announcements during 1981–2002, I document neg- ative returns to issuers but insignificant returns to nonissuers in both samples, and insignificant changes in combined firm value and parent’s nonsubsidiary equity value in subsidiary SEOs. Firms issue equity to meet their own financing needs. My evi- dence contrasts with previous studies and suggests that parent–subsidiary structures do not enhance financing flexibility. Corporate Acquisitions AND Divestitures have been a constant feature of the U.S. Financial markets. The combination of synergistic businesses and separation of nonsynergistic businesses is believed to increase the combined value of firms. Sometimes, however, the acquiring firm seeks only a partial stake in a target firm, or the divesting firm sells only a partial stake in a divested unit. Such par- tial acquisitions and equity carve-outs result in a parent–subsidiary structure in which both the parent and the subsidiary stocks are publicly traded. This paper examines the equity issuance decisions within such parent– subsidiary structures. Specifically, I examine whether firms exploit their parent–subsidiary structure to issue equity in the overvalued firm regardless Jon Garfinkel",

    "title": "Does the Contribution of Corporate Cash",
    "abstract": "Agency theories predict that the value of corporate cash holdings is less in countries with poor investor protection because of the greater ability of controlling shareholders to extract private benefits from cash holdings in such countries. Using various spec- ifications of the valuation regressions of Fama and French (1998), we find that the relation between cash holdings and firm value is much weaker in countries with poor investor protection than in other countries. In further support of the importance of agency theories, the relation between dividends and firm value is weaker in countries with stronger investor protection. According TO Agency Theories , Those who control firms do so to further their own interests. When corporate governance works well, those in control of a cor- poration, whom we refer to as controlling shareholders, find it more beneficial to increase shareholder wealth than to expropriate minority shareholders. In contrast, with poor corporate governance, controlling shareholders can derive substantial private benefits from control at the expense of minority sharehold- ers (see, for instance, Dyck and Zingales (2004) and Nenova (2003)). As Myers and Rajan (1998) argue, liquid assets can be turned into private benefits at lower cost than other assets. Liquid assets therefore represent a promising opportunity to investigate the implications of agency theories. Ac- cording to these theories, we would expect controlling shareholders to overin- vest in liqui",

    "title": "Does the Failure of the Expectations Hypothesis",
    "abstract": "We solve the portfolio problem of a long-run investor when the term structure is Gaussian and when the investor has access to nominal bonds and stock. We apply our method to a three-factor model that captures the failure of the expectations hypothesis. We extend this model to account for time-varying expected inflation, and estimate the model with both inflation and term structure data. The estimates imply that the bond portfolio of a long-run investor looks very different from the portfolio of a mean- variance optimizer. In particular, time-varying term premia generate large hedging demands for long-term bonds. THE Expectations Hypothesis OF Interest Rates states that the premium on long- term bonds over short-term bonds is constant over time. According to this hy- pothesis, there are no particularly good times to invest in long-term bonds relative to short-term bonds, nor are there particularly bad times. Long-term bonds will always offer the same expected excess return. While the expectations hypothesis is theoretically appealing, it has consis- tently failed in U.S. Postwar data. Fama and Bliss (1987) and Campbell and Shiller (1991), among others, show that expected excess returns on long-term bonds (term premia) do vary over time, and moreover, it is possible to predict excess returns on bonds using observables such as the forward rate or the term spread. This paper explores the consequences of the failure of the expectations hypothesis for long-term investors. Helpful c",

    "title": "Does the Scope of the Sell-Side Analyst Industry",
    "abstract": "We examine changes in the scope of the sell-side analyst industry and whether these changes impact information dissemination and the quality of analysts’ reports. Our ﬁndings suggest that changes in the number of analysts covering an industry impact analyst competition and have signiﬁcant spillover effects on other analysts’ forecast accuracy, bias, report informativeness, and effort. These spillover industry effects are incremental to the effects of ﬁrm level changes in analyst coverage. Overall, a more signiﬁcant sell-side analyst industry presence has positive externalities that can result in better functioning capital markets. Sell-side Financial Analysts Play an important role in capital markets. Ana- lysts facilitate the distribution of ﬁnancial information, and their reports pro- vide valuable information to market participants (e.g., Grossman and Stiglitz (1980), Womack ( 1996), Kadan et al. ( 2009), Loh and Stulz ( 2011)). Further, analysts help shape capital markets through their interactions with underwrit- ers, brokers, institutional investors (IIs), and management. It is not surprising therefore that the behavior of analysts has captured the attention of many academic studies. These prior studies consider various aspects of analysts’ ac- tivities such as their choice to cover particular ﬁrms (Jegadeesh et al.

The problem is widespread, resulting in up to 31.4% of funds being misclassiﬁed with safer proﬁles, compared to their true, publicly reported holdings. “Misclassiﬁed funds”—those that hold risky bonds but claim to hold safer bonds—appear to on- average outperform lower risk funds in their peer groups.

    "abstract": "This paper explores a model based on agents with heterogenous beliefs facing short sales restrictions, and its explanation for the rise, persistence, and even- tual fall of Internet stock prices. First, we document substantial short sale restrictions for Internet stocks. Second, using data on Internet holdings and block trades, we show a link between heterogeneity and price effects for Inter- net stocks. Third, arguing that lockup expirations are a loosening of the short sale constraint, we document average, long-run excess returns as low as - 33 percent for Internet stocks postlockup.We link the Internet bubble burst to the unprecedented level of lockup expirations and insider selling. IN THE Two-year Period from early 1998 through February 2000, the Internet sector earned over 1000 percent returns on its public equity. In fact, by this date, the Internet sector equaled 6 percent of the market capitalization of all U.S. Public companies and 20 percent of all publicly traded equity volume. As is well docu- mented, however, these returns had completely disappeared by the end of 2000. What can explain this rise, persistence, and then subsequent fall of Internet stock prices?

    "title": "Downward-Sloping Demand Curves,",
    "abstract": "Over March and April 2000, Internet stocks lost 56%, or $700 billion. This sudden collapse has been attributed to an increasing supply of shares from lockup expirations and equity offerings. I show that Internet stocks collapsed in this period regardless of whether their lockups expired. Furthermore, daily Internet stock portfolio returns were almost unaffected by the number or dollar amount of lockup expirations that day, or by the amount of stock offered in IPOs or SEOs. Most of the Internet stock decline is explained by poor marketwide returns, particularly for growth stocks. Nasdaq Stocks , IN General , AND Stocks related to the Internet, in particular, declined sharply in March and April 2000. An equal-weighted portfolio of all Internet stocks lost over 56% between March 10, 2000, and April 17, 2000, with declines of 10.6% on April 3, 10.9% on April 12, and 15.2% on April 14. Over this period, the capitalization of these stocks fell by over $718 billion. In this paper I examine whether the collapse of Internet stock prices can be attributed to the rapid increase in the supply of shares in these companies. Lockup expirations and follow-on offerings made billions of dollars worth of shares in Internet stocks available to public investors near their market peak.

    "abstract": "This paper documents a previously unrecognized debt-related investment distortion. Using detailed project-level data for 69 ﬁrms in the oil and gas industry, we ﬁnd that highly levered ﬁrms pull forward investment, completing projects early at the expense of long-run project returns and project value. This behavior is particularly pronounced prior to debt renegotiations. We test several channels that could explain this behavior and ﬁnd evidence consistent with equity holders sacriﬁcing long-run project returns to enhance collateral values and, by extension, mitigate lending frictions at debt renegotiations. Understanding HOW Debt Affects a ﬁrm’s investment decisions is one of the central questions in ﬁnance. Incentive conﬂicts between debt and equity claimants have the potential to result in inefﬁcient and value-destroying de- cisions (Jensen and Meckling (1976)).

The investor distraction hypothesis holds that extraneous news inhibits market reactions to relevant news.

In our model, if the seller accepts an offer, the winning bidder (or “acquirer”) can gather information and chooses when to complete the transaction. In equilibrium, the acquirer engages in “too much” due diligence. Our quantitative results suggest that the magnitude of the distortion is economically signiﬁcant. Nev- ertheless, allowing for due diligence can improve both total surplus and the seller’s payoff compared to a setting without due diligence. We use our framework to explore the timing of due diligence, bidder heterogeneity, and breakup fees. DUE Diligence IS Pervasive .I T is perhaps most salient within the context of corporate acquisitions and real estate transactions, but a period of “discovery” prior to the transfer of ownership and during which the acquirer can gather in- formation extends well beyond these two realms.

    "abstract": "Extensive discussions on the inefﬁciencies of “short-termism” in executive compen- sation notwithstanding, little is known empirically about the extent of such short- termism. We develop a novel measure of executive pay duration that reﬂects the vesting periods of different pay components, thereby quantifying the extent to which compensation is short-term. We calculate pay duration in various industries and doc- ument its correlation with ﬁrm characteristics. Pay duration is longer in ﬁrms with more growth opportunities, more long-term assets, greater R&D intensity, lower risk, and better recent stock performance. Longer CEO pay duration is negatively related to the extent of earnings-increasing accruals. IT IS Well RECOGNIZEDthat executive compensation is an important tool of corpo- rate governance in aligning the interests of shareholders and managers. Issues related to how executive compensation should be structured have therefore and Murphy (1990) argued famously that what matters in CEO pay is not how much you pay, buthow you pay. To this end, an active debate has raged on about what should be the optimal duration of executive compensation. On the one side of the debate, critics of the executive pay process (e.g., Bebchuk and Fried (2010)) argue that compensation contracts put too much emphasis on short-term performance and should be modiﬁed. They caution that exces- sive compensation short-termism could lead to self-interested and often myopic managerial behavior. On th",

    "abstract": "We propose a duration-based explanation for the premia on major equity factors, in- cluding value, proﬁtability, investment, low-risk, and payout factors. These factors invest in ﬁrms that earn most of their cash ﬂows in the near future and could there- fore be driven by a premium on near-future cash ﬂows. We test this hypothesis using a novel data set of single-stock dividend futures, which are claims on dividends of individual ﬁrms. Consistent with our hypothesis, the expected Capital Asset Pricing Model alpha on individual cash ﬂows decreases in maturity within a ﬁrm, and the alpha is not related to the above characteristics when controlling for maturity. IN This Paper , WE Provide a simple framework for understanding the ma- jor equity risk factors in asset pricing. We focus our analysis on value, proﬁt, investment, low-risk, and payout factors. These ﬁve categories of risk factors have a large impact on stock prices given their high persistence, and they form the basis of leading factor models such as the Fama and French models.1 Yet, the economics behind these factors are not well understood because the fac- tors are hard to relate to common economic fundamentals. We relate the risk factors back to economic fundamentals, and identify the source of their high Francesca Bastianello, Bruno Biais, John Campbell, Mike Chernov, John Cochrane, Will Diamond, Darrell Dufﬁe, Eugene Fama, Andrei Gonçalves, Stefano Giglio, Robin Greenwood, Sam Hartz- mark, Ralph Koijen, Serhiy Koza",

    "title": "Dynamic Agency and the q Theory of Investment",
    "abstract": "We develop an analytically tractable model integrating dynamic investment the- ory with dynamic optimal incentive contracting, thereby endogenizing ﬁnancing constraints. Incentive contracting generates a history-dependent wedge between marginal and averageq, and both vary over time as good (bad) performance relaxes (tightens) ﬁnancing constraints. Financial slack, not cash ﬂow, is the appropriate proxy for ﬁnancing constraints. Investment decreases with idiosyncratic risk, and is positively correlated with past proﬁts, past investment, and managerial compensa- tion even with time-invariant investment opportunities. Optimal contracting involves deferred compensation, possible termination, and compensation that depends on ex- ogenous observable persistent proﬁtability shocks, effectively paying managers for luck. THE Efficiency OF CORPORATEinvestment decisions can be compromised by fric- tions in external ﬁnancing. One important source of ﬁnancial market frictions involves agency problems. Firms do not have access to as much capital as they might like, or at low enough cost, because outside investors are wary of man- agers’ incentives to act in their own private interest. In this paper, we examine the implications of agency problems for the dynamics of ﬁrms’ investment de- cisions and ﬁrm value. We start with a standard dynamic model of corporate investment, theq theory of investment (seeHayashi (1982)). In the absence of ﬁxed investment costs and no ﬁnancial market frictions,",

    "title": "Dynamic Asset Allocation under Inflation",
    "abstract": "We develop a simple framework for analyzing a finite-horizon investor's asset al- location problem under inflation when only nominal assets are available. The in- vestor's optimal investment strategy and indirect utility are given in simple closed form. Hedge demands depend on the investor's horizon and risk aversion and on the maturities of the bonds included in the portfolio. When short positions are precluded, the optimal strategy consists of investments in cash, equity, and a sin- gle nominal bond with optimally chosen maturity. Both the optimal stock-bond mix and the optimal bond maturity depend on the investor's horizon and risk aversion. AN Investor WHO HAS A Long-term but finite horizon and can invest only in nominal bonds or stocks faces a basic problem. Is it better to purchase a zero coupon bond corresponding to the horizon and bear the inflation risk, to follow a policy of rolling over short-term bonds, or to adopt some quite dif- ferent strategy? Despite the simplicity of this issue, there is still no well- accepted framework for analyzing it because nominal long-term bonds have two important characteristics that cannot be represented adequately within the classical static, single-period, framework introduced by Markowitz (1959). First, the prices of bonds decline as interest rates rise so that, as Merton (1973) originally pointed out, long-term bonds can provide a hedge against adverse shifts in the investor's future investment opportunity set.

    "title": "Dynamic Asset Allocation with Event Risk",
    "abstract": "Major events often trigger abrupt changes in stock prices and volatility. We study the implications of jumps in prices and volatility on investment strate- gies. Using the event-risk framework of Duffie, Pan, and Singleton (2000), we provide analytical solutions to the optimal portfolio problem. Event risk dra- matically affects the optimal strategy. An investor facing event risk is less willing to take leveraged or short positions. The investor acts as if some por- tion of his wealth may become illiquid and the optimal strategy blends both dynamic and buy-and-hold strategies. Jumps in prices and volatility both have important effects. ONE OF THE Inherent Hazards of investing in financial markets is the risk of a major event precipitating a sudden large shock to security prices and volatilities. There are many examples of this type of event, including, most recently, the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Other recent examples include the stock market crash of October 19,1987, in which the Dow index fell by 508 points, the October 27,1997, drop in the Dow index by more than 554 points, and the flight to quality in the aftermath of the Russian debt default where swap spreads increased on August 27, 1998, by more than 20 times their daily standard deviation, leading to the downfall of Long Term Capital Management and many other highly leveraged hedge funds.

    "title": "Dynamic Banking and the Value of Deposits",
    "abstract": "We propose a theory of banking in which banks cannot perfectly control deposit ﬂows. Facing uninsurable loan and deposit shocks, banks dynamically manage lending, wholesale funding, deposits, and equity. Deposits create value by lowering funding costs. However, when the bank is undercapitalized and at risk of breaching leverage requirements, the marginal value of deposits can turn negative as deposit inﬂows, by raising leverage, increase the likelihood of costly equity issuance. Banks’ inability to fully control leverage distinguishes them from nondepository intermediaries. Our model suggests a reevaluation of leverage regulations and offers new perspectives on banking in a low-interest-rate environment.

    "title": "Dynamic CEO Compensation",
    "abstract": "We study optimal compensation in a dynamic framework where the CEO consumes in multiple periods, can undo the contract by privately saving, and can temporarily inﬂate earnings. We obtain a simple closed-form contract that yields clear predic- tions for how the level and performance sensitivity of pay vary over time and across ﬁrms. The contract can be implemented by escrowing the CEO’s pay into a “Dynamic Incentive Account” that comprises cash and the ﬁrm’s equity. The account features state-dependent rebalancing to ensure its equity proportion is always sufﬁcient to induce effort, and time-dependent vesting to deter short-termism. Many Classical Models OF CEO compensation consider only a single period, or multiple periods with a single terminal consumption. However, the optimal static contract may be ineffective in a dynamic world. In reality, securities given to incentivize the CEO may lose their power over time: if ﬁrm value declines, options may fall out of the money and bear little sensitivity to the stock price. The CEO may be able to engage in private saving to achieve a higher future income than intended by the contract, in turn reducing his ef- fort incentives. Single-period contracts can encourage the CEO to engage in short-termism/myopia, that is, inﬂate the current stock price at the expense of long-run value. In addition to the above challenges, a dynamic setting pro- vides opportunities to the ﬁrm—it can reward effort with future rather than current pay. This pa",

    "abstract": "Using contract-level data for the Canadian mortgage market, this paper provides ev- idence of an “invest-and-harvest” pricing pattern. We build a dynamic model of price negotiation with search and switching frictions to capture key market features. We estimate the model and use it to investigate the effects of market frictions and the re- sulting dynamic competition on borrowers’ and banks’ payoffs. We show that dynamic pricing and the presence of search and switching costs have important implications for public policies. Many Markets Feature Repeated Interactions where customers and ﬁrms negotiate over prices. Examples include the market for mortgages (Wood- ward and Hall ( 2012), Allen, Clark, and Houde ( 2019)), unsecured consumer credit (Cuesta and Sepulveda ( 2021), Agarwal et al. ( 2023b)), small business lending (Degryse and Ongena ( 2005)), auto insurance (Honka ( 2014)), health insurance (Dafny ( 2010)), and many business-to-business transactions (Mar- shall ( 2020), Salz ( 2022)). Customers in these markets normally face nontriv- ial costs of searching for price quotes and switching providers.

    "title": "Dynamic Competition, Valuation, and Merger",
    "abstract": "We model the interactions between product market competition and investment valu- ation within a dynamic oligopoly. To our knowledge, the model is the ﬁrst continuous- time corporate ﬁnance model in a multiple ﬁrm setting with heterogeneous products. The model is tractable and amenable to estimation. We use it to relate current in- dustry characteristics with ﬁrm value and ﬁnancial decisions. Unlike most corporate ﬁnance models, it produces predictions regarding parameter magnitudes as well their signs. Estimates of the model’s parameters indicate strong linkages between model- implied and actual values. The paper uses the estimated parameters to predict rivals’ returns near merger announcements. Intuition AND Fundamental Microeconomic theory tell us that product mar- ket dynamics should have a signiﬁcant impact on valuation and ﬁnancial in- centives. Yet, directly testable models relating these issues have been largely absent from the corporate ﬁnance literature. This paper helps ﬁll some of these gaps by presenting a tractable framework for examining ﬁnancial decision- making in a dynamic oligopoly with heterogeneous products. It shows that a ﬁrm’s competitive position can both profoundly inﬂuence its ﬁnancial decisions and impact how the ﬁrm is inﬂuenced by the decisions of others. The model’s explicit closed-form solution allows one to estimate its parameters with ease. This paper takes advantage of this feature to apply the model to two ﬁnancial questions: (1) cross-sect",

    "abstract": "Private equity funds intermediate investment and affect portfolio ﬁrm performance by actively engaging in operational, governance, and ﬁnancial engineering. We study this type of intermediation in a dynamic agency model in which an active intermedi- ary raises funds from outside investors and invests in a ﬁrm run by an agent. Optimal contracting addresses moral hazard at the intermediary and ﬁrm levels. The inter- mediary’s incentives to affect ﬁrm performance are strongest after poor performance, while the agent’s incentives are strongest after good performance. We also show how ﬁnancial engineering, that is, ﬁnancial contracting with outside investors, interacts with operational and governance engineering. Financial Intermediaries — Such AS Private equity (PE) funds, hedge funds, and banks—play a crucial role for ﬁrms and their performance, as they affect corporate governance, monitor management’s activities, and ac- tively seek to improve ﬁrm operations. While these active intermediaries may possess unique abilities to improve ﬁrm performance and address ﬁrm-level agency conﬂicts, they are subject to agency frictions of their own. Thus, active intermediation is a double-agency problem, and the efﬁciency of gov- ernance, operating, and ﬁnancing decisions can be compromised by these title “Delegated Monitoring and Contracting.” We thank Philip Bond (the editor), an anonymous associate editor, and two anonymous referees for their comments and suggestions.

    "abstract": "We present a novel approach to dynamic portfolio selection that is as easy to im- plement as the static Markowitz paradigm. We expand the set of assets to include mechanically managed portfolios and optimize statically in this extended asset space. We consider “conditional” portfolios, which invest in each asset an amount propor- tional to conditioning variables, and “timing” portfolios, which invest in each asset for a single period and in the risk-free asset for all other periods. The static choice of these managed portfolios represents a dynamic strategy that closely approximates the optimal dynamic strategy for horizons up to 5 years. Several Studies Point OUT THE IMPORTANCEof dynamic trading strategies to exploit the predictability of the first and second moments of asset returns and hedge changes in the investment opportunity set. However, computing these optimal dynamic investment strategies has proven to be a rather formidable problem be- cause closed-form solutions are only available for a few cases. While researchers have explored a variety of numerical solution methods, including solving par- tial differential equations, discretizing the state-space, and using Monte Carlo simulation, these techniques are out of reach for most practitioners and thus they remain largely in the ivory tower. The workhorse of portfolio optimization in industry remains the static Markowitz approach. Our paper presents a novel approach to dynamic portfolio selection that is no more diffic",

    "title": "Dynamic Trading with Predictable Returns",
    "abstract": "We derive a closed-form optimal dynamic portfolio policy when trading is costly and security returns are predictable by signals with different mean-reversion speeds. The optimal strategy is characterized by two principles: (1) aim in front of the target, and (2) trade partially toward the current aim. Speciﬁcally, the optimal updated portfolio is a linear combination of the existing portfolio and an “aim portfolio,” which is a weighted average of the current Markowitz portfolio (the moving target) and the expected Markowitz portfolios on all future dates (where the target is moving). Intuitively, predictors with slower mean-reversion (alpha decay) get more weight in the aim portfolio. We implement the optimal strategy for commodity futures and ﬁnd superior net returns relative to more naive benchmarks. Active Investors AND Asset managers—such as hedge funds, mutual funds, and proprietary traders—try to predict security returns and trade to proﬁt from their predictions. Such dynamic trading often entails signiﬁcant turnover and transaction costs. Hence, any active investor must constantly weigh the expected beneﬁt of trading against its costs and risks. An investor often uses different return predictors, for example, value and momentum predictors, and these have different prediction strengths and mean-reversion speeds—put dif- ferently, different “alphas” and “alpha decays.” The alpha decay is important because it determines how long the investor can enjoy high expected return",

Consistent with the model, prices align with consumption betas and comove with aggregate dividends, particularly so when risk premia are higher.

In particular, I explore the hypothesis that policies that promote pension savings also promote the development of capital markets. I present a model that endogenizes the extent to which savings are intermediated through banks or capital markets, and derive implications for corporate ﬁnance, household ﬁnance, banking, and the size of the ﬁnancial sector. I then present a number of facts that are broadly consistent with the theory and examine a variety of alternative explanations of my ﬁndings. Countries Around THE WORLDhave made vastly different choices about how to meet the retirement needs of their populations. Some have chosen to ﬁnance retirement incomes largely by taxing current workers, in so-called pay-as-you- go (“paygo”) pension systems. Others have promoted private pension saving as a way to fund retirement beneﬁts. For example, according to the Oecd, in Italy and Denmark the average worker entering the labor force in 2014 could retire at age 67 and expect to have almost 70% of his or her preretirement income replaced by pension income (oecd (2015)). In Italy this pension income would be ﬁnanced in large part by taxes on current workers, while in Denmark much of this income would be generated by the assets of private pension schemes.

    "abstract": "U.S. Exchange-traded stock options are exercisable before expiration. While put op- tions should frequently be exercised early to earn interest, they are not. In this paper, we derive an early exercise decision rule and then examine actual exercise behavior during the period January 1996 through September 2008. We ﬁnd that more than 3.96 million puts that should have been exercised early remain unexercised, repre- senting over 3.7% of all outstanding puts. We also ﬁnd that failure to exercise cost put option holders $1.9 billion in forgone interest income and that this interest is systematically captured by market makers and proprietary ﬁrms. Stock Options Traded ON exchanges in the U.S. May be exercised before con- tract expiration. While early exercise decisions by option holders have been examined empirically in a number of studies, most have focused on call options. The decision about whether to exercise a call early depends on the amount of any cash dividends paid during the option’s life. Since exchange-traded options are unprotected from cash dividend payments on the underlying stock, hold- ers of deep in-the-money calls may ﬁnd it optimal to exercise their positions just prior to the ex-dividend day when the stock price drops by the amount of the cash dividend. If no cash dividends are paid, early exercise is suboptimal.

We pro- pose a risk-based explanation for this phenomenon, whereby investors use announcements to revise their expectations for non-announcing ﬁrms, but can only do so imperfectly. Con- sequently, the covariance between ﬁrm-speciﬁc and market cash ﬂow news spikes around announcements, making announcers especially risky. Consistent with our hypothesis, an- nouncer returns forecast aggregate earnings. The announcement premium is persistent across stocks, and early (late) announcers earn higher (lower) returns.

    "title": "Earnings Management and Firm Performance",
    "abstract": "Both post-repurchase abnormal returns and reported improvement in operating per- formance are driven, at least in part, by pre-repurchase downward earnings manage- ment rather than genuine growth in profitability. The downward earnings manage- ment increases with both the percentage of the company that managers repurchase and CEO ownership. Pre-repurchase abnormal accruals are also negatively associ- ated with future performance, with the association driven mainly by those firms that report the largest income-decreasing abnormal accruals. The study suggests that one reason firms experience post-repurchase abnormal returns is that post-repurchase realized earnings growth exceeds expectations formed on the basis of pre-repurchase deflated earnings numbers. The last two decades have seen a proliferation of stock repurchases. According to Stefan Selig, vice-chairman of Banc of America Securities, “[r]epurchasing stock is one of the most frequently discussed corporate finance topics in board- rooms today” (Business Week Online, November 29, 2004). The increasing importance of repurchases in corporate payout policy has stimulated a consid- erating and stock performance after repurchases remains largely unexplained. Further, although many well-documented anomalies seem to have disappeared in recent years (see Schwert (2003)), Peyer and Vermaelen (2006) find that long- term post-repurchase abnormal returns still persist.

    "abstract": "We propose a theory of mergers that combines managerial merger motives with an industry-level regime shift that may lead to value-increasing merger opportunities. Anticipation of these merger opportunities can lead to defensive acquisitions, where managers acquire other firms to avoid losing private benefits if their firms are ac- quired, or “positioning” acquisitions, where firms position themselves as more attrac- tive takeover targets to earn takeover premia. The identity of acquirers and targets and the profitability of acquisitions depend on the distribution of firm sizes within an industry, among other factors. We find empirical support for some unique predictions of our theory. THE 1990S Produced THE Greatest Wave of mergers in U.S. History. Between 1995 and 2000, U.S. Merger volume set a new record every year, reach- ing about $1.8 trillion in 2000. 1 Merger activity then fell sharply, dropping to under $500 billion in 2002, before increasing again to about $1.6 tril- lion in 2007. 2 Because of the growth and importance of mergers, a substan- tial academic literature has developed to examine them.

    "title": "Economic Distress, Financial Distress,",
    "abstract": "Many firms emerging from a debt restructuring remain highly leveraged, continue to invest little, perform poorly, and often reenter financial distress. The existing literature interprets these findings as inefficiencies arising from coordination prob- lems among many creditors or an inefficient design of bankruptcy law. In contrast, this paper emphasizes that creditors lack the information that is needed to make quick and correct liquidation decisions. It can explain the long-term nature of fi- nancial distress solely as the result of dynamic learning strategies of creditors and suggests that it may be an unavoidable byproduct of an efficient resolution of financial distress. Financial Distress IS Often a long-term process and has an impact on the capital structure, investment policies, and performance of many firms even after they emerge from debt restructurings. James (1995) finds that many firms increase their investment expenditures only by very little in the first two years after a debt restructuring. Hotchkiss (1995) shows that in each of the first five years after emerging from bankruptcy, between 35 percent and 41 percent of all firms have negative operating income. According to Gilson (1997), more than 75 percent of firms that complete debt restructurings emerge with a leverage ratio that is higher than industry median and most are still significantly more highly leveraged than before the onset of financial dis- tress. Furthermore, between one quarter and one third o",

    "title": "Economic Links and Predictable Returns",
    "abstract": "This paper finds evidence of return predictability across economically linked firms. We test the hypothesis that in the presence of investors subject to attention con- straints, stock prices do not promptly incorporate news about economically related firms, generating return predictability across assets. Using a data set of firms’ princi- pal customers to identify a set of economically related firms, we show that stock prices do not incorporate news involving related firms, generating predictable subsequent price moves. A long–short equity strategy based on this effect yields monthly alphas of over 150 basis points. Firms DO NOT Exist AS Independent Entities , but are linked to each other through many types of relationships. Some of these links are clear and contractual, while others are implicit and less transparent. We use the former of these, clear economic links, as an instrument to test investor inattention. Specifically, we focus on well-defined customer–supplier links between firms. In these cases, partner firms are stakeholders in each others’ operations. Thus, any shock to one firm has a resulting effect on its linked partner. We examine how shocks to one firm translate into shocks to the linked firm in both real quantities (i.e., profits) and stock prices. If investors take into account the ex ante pub- licly available 1 and often longstanding customer–supplier links, prices of the partner firm will adjust when news about its linked firm is released into the market.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies government reactions to large corporate merger attempts in the European Union during 1997 to 2006 using hand-collected data. We document widespread economic nationalism in which the government prefers that target com- panies remain domestically owned rather than foreign-owned. This preference is stronger in times and countries with strong far-right parties and weak governments. Nationalist government reactions have both direct and indirect economic impacts on mergers. In particular, these reactions not only affect the outcome of the mergers that they target but also deter foreign companies from bidding for other companies in that country in the future. “Come sta?”1 Corporate Mergers AND Acquisitions are an important part of a market econ- omy. Large ﬁrms often enter into a new market through acquisitions of local ﬁrms. If there is excess capacity in a sector, weak ﬁrms often exit the economy, not necessarily through bankruptcy, but by being acquired by another ﬁrm. When such mergers take place between companies from different countries, national economies become more integrated. Yet, the reaction of governments to merger attempts often seems to be motivated by concerns other than compe- tition. In particular, government interventions often appear to depend on the “nationality” of the acquiring company. Nationalist interventions by domestic governments do not simply take the form of opposition to foreign acquirers. They also include support for domestic shar",

    "title": "Economic News and the Impact of Trading",
    "abstract": "This paper studies the impact of trading on government bond prices surrounding the release of macroeconomic news. The results show a significant increase in the informa- tional role of trading following economic announcements, which suggests the release of public information increases the level of information asymmetry in the government bond market. The informational role of trading is greater after announcements with a larger initial price impact, and the relation is associated with the surprise component of the announcement and the precision of the public information. The results provide evidence that government bond order flow reveals fundamental information about riskless rates. When Some Market Participants have private information about the value of an asset, their trades reveal information to the market. In equilibrium, the sensi- tivity of prices to order flow will depend on the prevailing level of information asymmetry. This concept was first formalized by Glosten and Milgrom (1985) and Kyle (1985), and since that time many researchers have sought to charac- terize the link between information asymmetry and the impact of trading on prices. This paper studies transaction data from the U.S. Treasury market in order to clarify the informational role of trading in financial markets. In equity markets, private information is traditionally considered to be ad- vanced knowledge of a firm’s cash flows. For example, Koski and Michaely (2000) find that trades preceding dividen",

    "title": "Effects of Corporate Diversification",
    "abstract": "That conglomerates are more productive than stand-alone firms at a given point in time. Dynamically, however, firms that diversify experience a net reduction in pro- ductivity. While the acquired plants increase productivity, incumbent plants suffer. Moreover, stock prices track firm productivity and this tracking is equally strong for diversified and stand-alone firms. Therefore, lower transparency of conglom- erates is unlikely to explain the discrepancy between productivity and stock prices on average. Finally, I offer some evidence that this discrepancy may arise because conglomerates dissipate rents in the form of higher wages. Corporate Diversification HAS Received much attention from academics as well as management practitioners. Several papers over the last decade have argued that diversification is related to lower valuation for shareholders. Lang and Stulz (1994), for example, find that diversified firms trade at an average discount of about eight percent relative to a portfolio of comparable stand-alone firms.1 A number of recent studies, however, question the inter- pretation of these findings or even their validity. Graham, Lemmon, and Wolf (1998) or Campa and Kedia (1999) suggest that the discount should not be interpreted as value destruction due to diversification, since firms which diversify are already discounted prior to diversifying. Moreover, Harris (1998) or Villalonga (2000) argue that Compustat segment data are systemati- cally biased in favor of findi",

    "abstract": "We analyze cross-sectional and time-series information from 46 equity markets around the world to consider whether short sales restrictions affect the efficiency of the market and the distributional characteristics of returns to individual stocks and market indices. We find some evidence that prices incorporate negative infor- mation faster in countries where short sales are allowed and practiced. A common conjecture by regulators is that short sales restrictions can reduce the relative sever- ity of a market panic. We find strong evidence that in markets where short selling is either prohibited or not practiced, market returns display significantly less negative skewness. IN February OF 1609, A Group OF Well -connected Dutch businessmen, led by one of the original subscribers to the Dutch East India Company, Isaac Le Maire, formed a secret association, a “Groote Companie,” to short the shares in the East India Company in anticipation of the incorporation of a rival French- chartered trading firm. Le Maire and his colleagues sold shares forward in a “blanco” transaction promising future delivery in 1 or 2 years. Over the next 12 months, their profits mounted, as East India Company shares dropped by 12%, angering shareholders who inevitably learned of their plan. In January of 1610, a year after the formation of the Groote Companie and only 8 years after the official founding of the Amsterdam Exchange, the first regulation against short selling was enacted.

We ﬁnd that the efﬁcient recapitalization mentation on sufﬁcient bank participation. Preferred stock plus warrants reduces opportunistic participation by banks that do not require recapitalization, although conditional implementation limits free riding by banks that beneﬁt from lower credit risk because of other banks’ participation. Efﬁcient recapitalization is proﬁtable if the beneﬁts of lower aggregate credit risk exceed the cost of implicit transfers to bank debt holders. Firms Invest TOO Little if they are ﬁnanced with too much debt. The reason is that the cash ﬂow generated by new investments accrues to existing debt holders if the ﬁrm goes bankrupt. As a result, new investments can increase a ﬁrm’s debt value while reducing its equity value. A ﬁrm that maximizes equity value may therefore forgo new investment opportunities, with the extent of such underinvestment increasing as the ﬁrm gets close to bankruptcy. This is the well-known debt overhang problem ﬁrst described in the seminal paper by Myers (1977). In this paper we ask whether and how a government should intervene in a ﬁ- nancial sector that suffers from debt overhang. We focus on debt overhang in the ﬁnancial sector because interactions among ﬁnancial institutions can amplify debt overhang at the aggregate level. Speciﬁcally, we analyze a general equi- librium model in which lending to",

    "abstract": "We consider a model where investors can invest directly or search for an asset man- ager, information about assets is costly, and managers charge an endogenous fee. The efﬁciency of asset prices is linked to the efﬁciency of the asset management market: if investors can ﬁnd managers more easily, more money is allocated to active manage- ment, fees are lower, and asset prices are more efﬁcient. Informed managers outper- form after fees, uninformed managers underperform, while the average manager’s performance depends on the number of “noise allocators.” Small investors should re- main uninformed, but large and sophisticated investors beneﬁt from searching for informed active managers since their search cost is low relative to capital. Hence, managers with larger and more sophisticated investors are expected to outperform. Asset Managers Play A Central role in making ﬁnancial markets efﬁcient, as their size allows them to spend signiﬁcant resources on acquiring and process- ing information. The asset management market is subject to its own frictions, however, since investors must search for informed asset managers. Indeed, in- stitutional investors ﬂy literally around the world to examine asset managers, assessing their investment process, trading infrastructure, risk management, and so on. Similarly, individual investors search for asset managers, some via local branches of ﬁnancial institutions, others via the internet or otherwise. In this context, a number of questions aris",

    "abstract": "Using a large sample of director elections, we document that shareholder votes are sig- nificantly related to firm performance, governance, director performance, and voting mechanisms. However, most variables, except meeting attendance and ISS recommen- dations, have little economic impact on shareholder votes—even poorly performing directors and firms typically receive over 90% of votes cast. Nevertheless, fewer votes lead to lower “abnormal” CEO compensation and a higher probability of removing poison pills, classified boards, and CEOs. Meanwhile, director votes have little impact on election outcomes, firm performance, or director reputation. These results provide important benchmarks for the current debate on election reforms. A Fundamental Component OF corporate governance is shareholder representa- size, composition, and impact of the board on firm performance, yet we know little about uncontested director elections. The subject is particularly impor- tant in today’s environment. Congress, stock exchanges, and individual firms have instituted dramatic governance changes. Moreover, shareholders, activist organizations, the New York Stock Exchange (nyse), and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have proposed and debated additional changes to the method by which directors are elected. Apart from directors, shareholders do not have representation in the compa- nies they own. If shareholder impact on director elections is weak, so is the link between owners and mana",

    "abstract": "We conduct an empirical analysis of forward prices in the PJM electricity market using a high-frequency data set of hourly spot and day-ahead forward prices. We find that there are significant risk premia in electricity forward prices. These pre- mia vary systematically throughout the day and are directly related to economic risk factors, such as the volatility of unexpected changes in demand, spot prices, and to- tal revenues. These results support the hypothesis that electricity forward prices in the Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland market are determined rationally by risk-averse economic agents. THE Issue OF HOW Electricity is priced in spot and forward wholesale power markets has become one of the most controversial topics facing utilities, power producers, regulators, political officials, accounting firms, and a broad array of financial market participants. Although the spotlight focused initially on Enron, recent allegations of questionable electricity trading practices at CMS Energy, Dynegy, Reliant Resources, and other major energy firms have raised questions about whether the electricity prices reflect economic fundamentals or are manipulated by the actions of large traders gaming the wholesale mar- ket. 1 An important complication that makes this issue particularly difficult to address is the unique nature of electricity as a commodity, since it is virtually nonstorable. This feature eliminates the buffering effect associated with hold- ing inventories, and ma",

    "abstract": "This paper uses recent advances in Bayesian estimation methods to exploit fully and efficiently the time-series and cross-sectional empirical restrictions of the Cox, In- gersoll, and Ross model of the term structure. We examine the extent to which the cross-sectional data (five different instruments) provide information about the model. We find that the time-series restrictions of the two-factor model are generally con- sistent with the data. However, the model's cross-sectional restrictions are not. We show that adding a third factor produces a significant statistical improvement, but causes the average time-series fit to the yields themselves to deteriorate. THE Seminal Term Structure Model of Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1985; CIR) has spawned numerous empirical investigations and theoretical generaliza- tions. The model imposes restrictions on the cross-sectional and time-series properties of the yield curve. Although the model is cast in continuous time, the discrete-time transition densities of the state variables are known. This paper demonstrates how to estimate the model and integrate over the (la- tent) state variables using the appropriate transition density. In so doing, we allow all of the data to provide information about the state variables, and we take full advantage of the parametric implications of a continuous-time model for discretely sampled data. We approach the estimation problem as econometricians viewing data generated by a CIR world with noise. We im-",

    "abstract": "The stochastic discount factor (SDF) method provides a unified general framework for econometric analysis of asset-pricing models. There have been concerns that, compared to the classical beta method, the generality of the SDF method comes at the cost of efficiency in parameter estimation a -d power in specification tests. We establish the correct framework for comparing the two methods and show that the SDF method is as efficient as the beta method for estimating risk premiums. Also, the specification test based on the SDF method is as powerful as the one based on the beta method. THE USE OF THE stochastic discount factor (SDF) method for econometric eval- uation of asset-pricing models has become common in the recent empirical finance literature. An SDF has the following property: The value of a finan- cial asset equals the expected value of the product of the payoff on the asset and the SDF. An asset-pricing model identifies a particular SDF that is a function of observable variables and model parameters. For example, a lin- ear factor pricing model identifies a specific linear function of the factors as an SDF. The SDF method involves estimating the asset-pricing model using its SDF representation and the generalized method of moments (GMM). As Cochrane (2001) points out, the SDF method is sufficiently general that it can be used for analysis of linear as well as nonlinear asset-pricing models, including pricing models for derivative securities.

    "abstract": "This paper provides evidence of risk-shifting behavior in the investment decisions of financially distressed firms. Using a real options framework, I show that shareholders’ risk-shifting incentives can reverse the expected negative relation between volatility and investment. I test two hypotheses that are consistent with risk-shifting behavior: (i) volatility has a positive effect on distressed firms’ investment; (ii) investments of distressed firms generate less value during times of high uncertainty. Empirical evidence using 40 years of data supports both hypotheses. I further evaluate the effect of various firm characteristics on risk shifting, and estimate the costs of the investment distortion. Shareholders OF Financially distressed firms may have incentives to invest in risk-increasing negative-NPV projects, as they reap the benefits if things go well, whereas the bondholders bear the costs if things go poorly. Since Galai and Masulis (1976) and Jensen and Meckling (1976) introduced this risk-shifting (asset substitution) problem, many theoretical papers have sought to identify factors that can mitigate the problem (e.g., debt structure, compensation, and regulation) and to assess its extent. There is very little empirical evidence, however, of whether the problem actually exists. In this paper I empirically examine risk-shifting behavior in distressed firms by studying the relation between investment and volatility. This relation is an- alyzed in the literature mainly",

    "abstract": "Growth in capital expenditures conditions subsequent classification of firms to port- folios based on size and book-to-market ratios, as in the widely used Fama and French (1992, 1993) methods. Growth in capital expenditures also explains returns to portfo- lios and the cross section of future stock returns. These findings are consistent with recent theoretical models (e.g., Berk, Green, and Naik (1999)) in which the exercise of investment-growth options results in changes in both valuation and expected stock returns. Cross section of stock returns and identify factors based on market value of equity and book-to-market ratios that explain returns over time. Size and book- to-market, in general, and the Fama–French factor model, in particular, are now routinely used to benchmark returns in studies of long-run stock performance. For example, recent studies report that anomalies such as the “new issues puzzle” attenuate when benchmarks incorporate size and book-to-market (Brav, Geczy, and Gompers (2000)). Whether observed book-to-market and size effects as distinguished by Fama and French result from an equilibrium asset-pricing model remains a controversial issue, however. Recently, a number of theorists have developed models that directly relate risk and return to firm-specific characteristics such as firm size and the book- to-market ratio.

    "abstract": "We derive empirical tests for the stochastic dominance efficiency of a given portfolio with respect to all possible portfolios constructed from a set of as- sets. The tests can be computed using straightforward linear programming. Bootstrapping techniques and asymptotic distribution theory can approxi- mate the sampling properties of the test results and allow for statistical infer- ence. Our results could provide a stimulus to the further proliferation of stochastic dominance for the problem of portfolio selection and evaluation. Using our tests, the Fama and French market portfolio is significantly ineffi- cient relative to benchmark portfolios formed on market capitalization and book-to-market equity ratio. THE Theory OF Stochastic Dominance (SD), developed by Hadar and Russell (1969), Hanoch and Levy (1969), Rothschild and Stiglitz (1970), and Whitmore (1970), among others, gives a systematic framework for analyzing economic behavior un- der uncertainty. SD has seen considerable theoretical development and empirical application in the last decades, in various areas of economics, finance, and statis- tics (see, e.g., Levy (1992, 1998)). It is useful for positive analysis (where the objec- tive is to analyze the decision rules actually used by decision makers) as well as normative analysis (where the objective is to support practical decision making).

    "title": "Employee Stock Option Exercise and Firm Cost",
    "abstract": "We develop an empirical model of employee stock option exercise that is suitable for valuation and allows for behavioral channels. We estimate exercise rates as functions of option, stock, and employee characteristics using all employee exercises at 88 public ﬁrms, 27 of them in the S&P 500. Increasing vesting frequency from annual to monthly reduces option value by 11% to 16%. Men exercise faster, reducing value by 2% to 4%, while top employees exercise slower, increasing value by 2% to 7%. Finally, we develop an analytic valuation approximation that is more accurate than methods used in practice. Employee Stock Options (esos) ARE A major component of corporate compen- sation and a material cost to ﬁrms. Murphy (2013) reports that options repre- sented 21% of CEO pay in 2011, and Meridian Compensation Partners (2018) report that 42% of their national sample use executive stock options. Despite the overall importance of ESOs in executive compensation, their valuation re- mains a challenge in practice as shown by the recent controversy over the value of options granted to the CEO of IBM, which Institutional Shareholder Services valued at more than twice the company’s valuation.1 The valuation of long-maturity American options such as ESOs is sensitive to assumptions about how they will be exercised.

    "title": "Employee Stock Options and Investment",
    "abstract": "Exercises of employee stock options generate substantial cash inﬂows to the ﬁrm. These cash inﬂows substitute for costly external ﬁnance in those states of the world in which the demand for investment is high. Using the fact that the proceeds from option exercises exhibit a distinct nonlinearity around the point where options fall out of the money, we estimate that ﬁrms increase investment by $0.34 for each dollar received from the exercise of stock options. Firms that face higher external ﬁnancing costs allocate more of the proceeds from option exercises to investment. Firms Increasingly Issue Equity indirectly by granting stock options to their employees. As option programs were extended to nonexecutive employees dur- ing the 1990s, the aggregate value of stock options granted by U.S. Companies increased more than tenfold from $11 billion in 1992 to $119 billion in 2000 (Hall and Murphy (2003)). As noted by Fama and French (2005), the value of stock issued to employees through compensation plans is signiﬁcantly larger than the value of stock issued through seasoned equity offerings (SEOs) and private placements. Moreover, for many ﬁrms, the proceeds (and associated tax beneﬁts) from option exercises have grown to become one of the largest items on the cash ﬂow statement. 1 Nevertheless, despite the substantial magnitude of these cash ﬂows, the extent to which they affect ﬁrm investment and ﬁnancing policies has received little attention in the academic literature.

    "title": "Employee Stock Options, Corporate Taxes,",
    "abstract": "We find that employee stock option deductions lead to large aggregate tax savings for Nasdaq 100 and S&P 100 firms and also affect corporate marginal tax rates. For Nasdaq firms, including the effect of options reduces the estimated median marginal tax rate from 31% to 5%. For S&P firms, in contrast, option deductions do not affect marginal tax rates to a large degree. Our evidence suggests that option deductions are important nondebt tax shields and that option deductions substitute for interest deductions in corporate capital structure decisions, explaining in part why some firms use so little debt. This Paper Explores the corporate tax implications of compensating employees with nonqualified stock options. Corporations deduct the difference between current market and strike prices when an employee exercises a nonqualified stock option. For option-intensive companies with rising stock prices, this de- duction can be very large. We focus on the effects of options on the year 2000 marginal tax rates (MTRs) for Nasdaq 100 and S&P 100 firms and the impli- cations for debt policy. Understanding the tax implications of options is increasingly important be- cause the proportion of compensation paid in stock options has soared in recent years. A perspective on the magnitude of options compensation and its increase over time can be gained from papers like the one by Desai (2002), who reports that in 2000 the top five officers of the 150 largest U.S. Firms received op- tions with gra",

    "title": "Endogenous Liquidity in Asset Markets",
    "abstract": "This paper analyzes a model in which long-term risky assets are illiquid due to ad- verse selection. The degree of adverse selection and hence the liquidity of these assets is determined endogenously by the amount of trade for reasons other than private information. I find that higher productivity leads to increased liquidity. Moreover, liquidity magnifies the effects of changes in productivity on investment and volume. High productivity implies that investors initiate larger scale risky projects which in- creases the riskiness of their incomes. Riskier incomes induce more sales of claims to high-quality projects, causing liquidity to increase. Market Liquidity Appears to vary with the state of the economy. This is evident in the variation in spreads between liquid and illiquid assets over the busi- ness cycle and in the fact that liquidity crises are associated with economic downturns. 1 Moreover, in the cross section highly productive industries and economies are associated with more liquid asset markets. This paper analyzes a model economy in which long-term risky assets vary in quality and are illiquid due to adverse selection. Investors can realize part of the value of payoffs from long-term assets early by issuing claims against the assets in a pooled market. The equilibrium claims price is determined by the average quality of claims sold. I use “liquidity” to describe the cost of transferring the value of expected future payoffs from long-term assets into current incom",

    "title": "Entrenchment and Severance Pay in Optimal",
    "abstract": "This paper explores how motivating an incumbent CEO to undertake actions that improve the effectiveness of his management interacts with the firm's policy on CEO replacement. Such policy depends on the presence and the size of severance pay in the CEO's compensation package and on the CEO's influ- ence on the board of directors regarding his own replacement (i.e., entrench- ment). We explain when and why the combination of some degree of entrenchment and a sizeable severance package is desirable. The analysis of- fers predictions about the correlation between entrenchment, severance pay, and incentive compensation. There ARE Substantial Cross-sectional Differences in the control exercised by cor- porate boards of directors. In some cases, the board can and does fire the CEO at will. In others, directors are effectively the puppets of the CEO and exert inde- pendent power only in extreme situations. The standard view in the literature is that, ideally, shareholders should have full control of the board of directors and that any form of CEO entrenchment is necessarily undesirable. This position, however, ignores some important interactions between managerial incentive problems and shareholder activism which we explore here. Indeed a CEO's influence on the board frequently reflects not so much a discre- tionary choice of shareholders but the endogenous accumulation of power in the hands of the incumbent CEO (Hermalin and Weisbach, 1998). Yet we challenge the view that full share",

    "title": "Entrepreneurial Shareholder Activism: Hedge",
    "abstract": "We examine recent confrontational activism campaigns by hedge funds and other pri- vate investors. The main parallels between the groups are a significantly positive market reaction for the target firm around the initial Schedule 13D filing date, signif- icantly positive returns over the subsequent year, and the activist’s high success rate in achieving its original objective. Further, both activists frequently gain board rep- resentation through real or threatened proxy solicitations. Two major differences are that hedge funds target more profitable firms than other activists, and hedge funds address cash flow agency costs whereas other private investors change the target’s investment strategies. IN This Paper, WE Examine Recent aggressive campaigns by entrepreneurial share- holder activists. In the spirit of Pound (1992), we define an entrepreneurial activist as an investor who buys a large stake in a publicly held corporation with the intention to bring about change and thereby realize a profit on the investment. We conduct our analyses on two samples of entrepreneurial activists. The common feature to both groups is that the investor is relatively free from the regulatory controls of the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and most notably the Investment Company Act of 1940.

    "abstract": "We examine two views of the creation of venture-backed start-ups, or “entrepreneurial spawning.” In one, young firms prepare employees for entrepreneurship, educating them about the process, and exposing them to relevant networks. In the other, indi- viduals become entrepreneurs when large bureaucratic employers do not fund their ideas. Controlling for firm size, patents, and industry, the most prolific spawners are originally venture-backed companies located in Silicon Valley and Massachusetts. Undiversified firms spawn more firms. Silicon Valley, Massachusetts, and originally venture-backed firms typically spawn firms only peripherally related to their core businesses. Overall, entrepreneurial learning and networks appear important in cre- ating venture-backed firms. There IS NOW A Large AND Growing Literature analyzing the factors that deter- mine whether entrepreneurs raise venture capital funding (Hellmann and Puri (2000), Burton, Sørensen, and Beckman (2002)) and the factors that affect the terms of this financing (Gompers (1997), Kaplan and Str¨omberg (2003)). There is much less understanding of how these venture capital-backed entrepreneurs come to be entrepreneurs in the first place. In this paper, we try to fill this gap by examining the factors that lead to the creation of venture capital-backed entrepreneurs, a process we term “entrepreneurial spawning.” We examine two views of the spawning process.

    "abstract": "Using the dispersion in stock returns during the ﬁnancial crisis as a source of exogenous variation in the wealth of Norwegian entrepreneurs who held listed stocks, I show that adverse shocks to the wealth of business owners had large effects on their ﬁrms’ ﬁnancing, employment, and investment. The effects on investment and employment are driven by young ﬁrms, that obtain differentially less bank ﬁnanc- ing following an owner wealth shock. The effects on employment operate primarily through reduced hiring. My ﬁndings highlight that equity-ﬁnancing frictions and the procyclicality of entrepreneurial wealth are important channels that can amplify eco- nomic shocks. Employment during economic crises. This literature highlights the importance of securing bank ﬁnancing to ﬁrms, which has had extensive and persistent policy implications (Crouzet and Tourre (2020)). However, this literature is largely mute on the effects of adverse shocks to the ﬁnancial health of busi- ness owners who serve as the primary source of funding for many small ﬁrms.1 While economic crises see disruptions to bank lending, they also see large drops in the wealth and liquidity of business owners. In the presence of ﬁ- nancial frictions, this procyclicality of entrepreneurial wealth may amplify the consequences of adverse economic shocks. This idea lies at the heart of the ﬁ- nancial accelerator framework of Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist (1999), an important underpinning of modern macroeconomics. Adverse",

    "abstract": "The literature is divided on the expected effects of increased competition and con- solidation in the financial sector on the supply of credit to relationship borrowers. This paper tests whether policy changes fostering competition and consolidation in U.S. Banking helped or harmed entrepreneurs. We find that the rate of new incor- porations increases following deregulation of branching restrictions, and that de- regulation reduces the negative effect of concentration on new incorporations. We also find the formation of new incorporations increases as the share of small banks decreases, suggesting that diversification benefits of size outweigh the possible comparative advantage small banks may have in forging relationships. Over THE Past TWO Decades, the U.S. Financial sector has been reshaped by rapid technological innovation and deregulation. In the 1970s, traditional financial intermediaries, mainly banks, provided the lion's share of credit to nonfinancial companies. At that time, banks had the advantage because they were protected from competitive pressures; price competition was limited by Regulation Q, and entry into banking markets was limited by restrictions on in-state branching and interstate banking. All of this changed over the past 25 years. Starting in the latter half of the 1970s, the U.S. Banking system began to be reshaped, both by technological innovations and by the removal of many of these constraining regulations.

    "title": "Episodic Liquidity Crises: Cooperative",
    "abstract": "We describe how episodic illiquidity arises from a breakdown in cooperation between market participants. We first solve a one-period trading game in continuous-time, using an asset pricing equation that accounts for the price impact of trading. Then, in a multi-period framework, we describe an equilibrium in which traders cooperate most of the time through repeated interaction, providing apparent liquidity to one another. Cooperation breaks down when the stakes are high, leading to predatory trading and episodic illiquidity. Equilibrium strategies that involve cooperation across markets lead to less frequent episodic illiquidity, but cause contagion when cooperation breaks down. WHY IS Illiquidity Rare and episodic? Pastor & Stambaugh (2003) detect only 14 aggregate low-liquidity months over the time period 1962 to 1999. Despite being of significant magnitude, most of the episodes were short-lived and were followed by long periods of liquidity. 1 The origin of this empirical observation still remains a puzzle. In this paper, we attempt to shed light on this puzzle by developing a theoretical model in which a breakdown in cooperation between traders in the market manifests itself in predatory trading. This mechanism leads to sudden and short-lived illiquidity. We develop a dynamic model of trading based on liquidity needs. During each period, a liquidity event may occur in which a trader is required to liquidate a large block of an asset in a relatively short time period. This",

    "title": "Equilibrium \"Anomalies\"",
    "abstract": "Many empirical \"anomalies\" are actually consistent with the single beta capi- tal asset pricing model if the empiricist utilizes an equity-only proxy for the true market portfolio. Equity betas estimated against this particular ineffi- cient proxy will be understated, with the error increasing with the firm's lever- age. Thus, firm-specific variables that correlate with leverage (such as book-to- market and size) will appear to explain returns after controlling for proxy beta simply because they capture the missing beta risk. Loadings on portfolios formed on relative leverage and relative distress completely subsume the powers of the Fama and French (1993) returns to small minus big market capi- talization (SMB) portfolios and returns to high minus low book-to-market (HML) portfolios factors in explaining cross-sectional returns. Assume a world where the single-beta capital asset pricing model (capm) prices all assets. Suppose further that an empiricist, wanting to learn about the risk- return relationship in the equity market calculates equity betas against a market portfolio proxy that ignores the economy's debt claims. If the empiricist then es- timates the cross-sectional relationship between return and proxy beta, what results does theory tell us to expect? We show that positive pricing errors, downwardly biased market risk pre- miums, and what appear to be cross-sectional anomalies related to corporate leverage are actual implications of the single-beta Capm in this sit",

    "abstract": "We develop a general equilibrium model linking the pricing of stocks and corporate bonds to endogenous movements in corporate leverage and aggregate volatility. The model features heterogeneous ﬁrms making optimal investment and ﬁnancing de- cisions and connects ﬂuctuations in macroeconomic quantities and asset prices to movements in the cross section of ﬁrms. Empirically plausible movements in leverage produce realistic asset return dynamics. Countercyclical leverage drives predictable variation in risk premia, and debt-ﬁnanced growth generates a high value premium. Endogenous default produces countercyclical aggregate volatility and credit spread movements that are propagated to the real economy through their effects on invest- ment and output. IT IS NOW Well Understood that leverage is a major driver of risk expo- sure and a key contributor to macroeconomic ﬂuctuations. Leverage pushes many corporations to default during downturns, often with substantial losses. Expectations of such losses affect the pricing of corporate debt, the issuance of which is used to ﬁnance growth options and accelerate expansions. Debt- ﬁnanced booms and debt-driven busts thus contribute to aggregate volatility and are reﬂected in asset returns, as the Great Recession of 2008 to 2009 has reminded us. Yet, developing a framework suitable to study the joint deter- mination of ﬁrms’ investment and leverage decisions, macroeconomic ﬂuctua- tions, and risk premia on stocks and corporate bonds has prov",

The fundamental value of the cryptocurrency is its stream of net transactional beneﬁts, which depend on its future prices. This implies that, in addition to fundamentals, equilibrium prices reﬂect sunspots. This in turn implies multiple equilibria and extrinsic volatility, that is, cryptocurrency prices ﬂuctuate even when fundamentals are constant. To match our model to the data, we construct indices measuring the net transactional beneﬁts of Bitcoin. In our calibration, part of the variations in Bitcoin returns reﬂects changes in net transactional beneﬁts, but a larger share reﬂects extrinsic volatility. What IS THE Fundamental Value of cryptocurrencies? Do high market valuations reﬂect fundamentals or speculation? Does high volatility reﬂect in- vestors’ irrationality?

    "abstract": "We study theoretically how the proliferation of new data (“data abundance”) affects the allocation of capital between quantitative and nonquantitative asset managers (“data miners” and “experts”), their performance, and price informativeness. Data miners search for predictors of asset payoffs and select those with a sufﬁciently high precision. Data abundance raises the precision of the best predictors, but it can in- duce data miners to search less intensively for high-precision signals. In this case, their performance becomes more dispersed and they receive less capital. Neverthe- less, data abundance always raises price informativeness and can therefore reduce asset managers’ average performance. “Quants have been helped by two transformative forces.

    "abstract": "We develop equilibrium models of exhaustible resource markets with endogenous extraction choices and prices. Our analysis demonstrates how adjustment costs can generate oil and gas forward price dynamics with two factors, consistent with the behavior these commodities exhibit in the Schwartz and Smith (2000) calibration. Our two-factor model predicts that stochastic volatility will arise in these markets as a natural consequence of production adjustments, however, and we provide supporting empirical evidence. Differences between endogenous price processes from our general equilibrium model and exogenous processes in earlier papers can generate significant differences in both financial and real option values. Contingent Claims Analysis IS Currently Used extensively in natural resource industries. For example, energy traders often use models suggested by Black (1976), Brennan and Schwartz (1985), Schwartz (1997) and others for risk man- agement as well as for valuing financial contracts and real investments. These reduced-form models, which assume an exogenous process that is typically cal- ibrated to some combination of historical prices and observed forward and option prices, have been successful in valuing and hedging relatively short- term financial contracts. Such models can be viewed as tools for interpolat- ing among comparable assets that trade in relatively liquid markets.

    "abstract": "We develop an equilibrium model of the term structure of forward prices for stor- able commodities. As a consequence of a nonnegativity constraint on inventory, the spot commodity has an embedded timing option that is absent in forward con- tracts. This option's value changes over time due to both endogenous inventory and exogenous transitory shocks to supply and demand. Our model makes predictions about volatilities of forward prices at different horizons and shows how conditional violations of the \"Samuelson effect\" occur. We extend the model to incorporate a permanent second factor and calibrate the model to crude oil futures data. Commodity Markets IN Recent Years have experienced dramatic growth in trading volume, the variety of contracts, and the range of underlying com- modities. Market participants are also increasingly sophisticated about rec- ognizing and exercising operational contingencies embedded in delivery contracts.' For all of these reasons, there is a widespread interest in models for pricing and hedging commodity-linked contingent claims. In this paper we present an equilibrium model of commodity spot and forward prices. By explicitly incorporating the microeconomics of supply, demand, and storage, our model captures some fundamental differences between commodities and financial assets. Empirically, commodities are strikingly different from stocks, bonds and other conventional financial assets. Among these differences are: Stulz and an anonymous referee fo",

We con- struct a general equilibrium “difference-of-opinion” model of sentiment in which there are two classes of agents, one of which is overconfident about a public signal, while still optimizing intertemporally. Overconfident investors overreact to the signal and introduce an additional risk factor causing stock prices to be excessively volatile. Con- sequently, rational investors choose a conservative portfolio; moreover, this portfolio depends not just on the current price divergence but also on their prediction about future sentiment and the speed of price convergence.

    "title": "Equilibrium Pricing and Optimal Hedging",
    "abstract": "Spot power prices are volatile and since electricity cannot be economically stored, familiar arbitrage-based methods are not applicable for pricing power derivative contracts. This paper presents an equilibrium model implying that the forward power price is a downward biased predictor of the future spot price if expected power demand is low and demand risk is moderate. However, the equilibrium for- ward premium increases when either expected demand or demand variance is high, because of positive skewness in the spot power price distribution. Preliminary em- pirical evidence indicates that the premium in forward power prices is greatest during the summer months. Wholesale Power Markets, where producers trade electricity among them- selves and with power-marketing and power-distribution companies, have ports that U.S. Wholesale power transactions during 1999 amounted to ap- proximately 2.6 billion megawatt hours (MWh), or about $85 billion. The U.S. Wholesale power market is soon likely to comprise the world's largest commodity market. Electricity as a commodity has many interesting characteristics, most of which stem from the fact that it cannot be economically stored.2 Market- Sharing, and Profitability in the Deregulated Electric Power Industry\" that was developed authors thank Douglas Cochran, Alexander Eydeland, Jean Gray, Paul Joskow, Vince Kamin- ski, John Dalle Molle, Steve Norris, Duane Seppi, Ren6 Stulz, Catherine Wolfram, and an anonymous referee for many helpful com",

    "title": "Equilibrium Subprime Lending",
    "abstract": "This paper develops an equilibrium model of a subprime mortgage market. Our goal is to offer a benchmark with which the recent subprime boom and bust can be compared. The model is tractable and delivers plausible orders of magnitude for borrowing capacities, as well as default and trading intensities. We offer simple explanations for several phenomena in the subprime market, such as the prevalence of teaser rates and the clustering of defaults. In our model, both nondiversiﬁable and diversiﬁable income risks reduce debt capacities. Thus, debt capacities need not be higher when a larger fraction of income risk is diversiﬁable. ONE OF THE Main goals of the ﬁnancial system is to make credit widely avail- able to potential borrowers. The rapid growth of the U.S. Subprime mortgage market was viewed as an important advance in this direction because banks provided credit to a group of individuals that previously were not considered creditworthy. Subprime lending practices came under close scrutiny, however, after a surge in delinquencies sparked a severe ﬁnancial crisis.1 The general belief is that banks supplied more credit than individuals could afford to repay. This leads to two important questions: what is the borrowing capacity of the subprime population, and what are the resulting default rates when borrowers exhaust this capacity? To investigate these questions, this paper develops an equilibrium model of a subprime mortgage market. Several features of our model are worth not",

    "title": "Equilibrium in a Dynamic Limit Order Market",
    "abstract": "We model a dynamic limit order market as a stochastic sequential game with rational traders. Since the model is analytically intractable, we provide an algorithm based on Pakes and McGuire (2001) to find a stationary Markov-perfect equilibrium. We then generate artificial time series and perform comparative dynamics. Conditional on a transaction, the midpoint of the quoted prices is not a good proxy for the true value. Further, transaction costs paid by market order submitters are negative on average, and negatively correlated with the effective spread. Reducing the tick size is not Pareto improving but increases total investor surplus. WE Consider A Dynamic Pure Limit Order market in which rational traders choose between buy and sell orders, and market and limit orders. We numerically solve for the equilibrium of the model and generate time series of trades and quotes. We characterize the equilibrium in terms of traders’ strategies, transaction costs of market orders, and welfare accruing to both market and limit orders. We find that the endogenous choice of orders has important implications for inferences drawn from transactions data. Agents in our model have a private value, or liquidity motive for trade, in addition to the common or consensus value of the asset. 1 Agents with low private values are eager to sell the asset, and often place ask quotes below the consensus value of the asset. Similarly, bid quotes are often above the consensus value. This has two immediate im",

    "title": "Equity Misvaluation and Default Options",
    "abstract": "We study whether default options are mispriced in equity values by employing a structural equity valuation model that explicitly takes into account the value of the option to default (or abandon the ﬁrm) and uses ﬁrm-speciﬁc inputs. We implement our model on the entire cross section of stocks and identify both over- and underpriced equities. An investment strategy that buys undervalued stocks and shorts overvalued stocks generates an annual four-factor alpha of about 11% for U.S. Stocks. The model’s performance is stronger for stocks with a higher value of the default option, such as distressed or highly volatile stocks. A Large Finance Literature Argues that equity securities are subject to po- tential misvaluation by investors (see Harvey, Liu, and Zhu (2016) for a recent survey), and that the extent of misvaluation impacts corporate decisions such as merger and acquisition activities, stock issuance and repurchases, and in- vestment policy. The sources of equity misvaluation are attributed primarily to cognitive biases (see, e.g., Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam (1998), Barberis, Shleifer, and Vishny (1998), Hong and Stein (1999), and Baker and Wurgler (2006)). In this paper, we provide a new direction by arguing that equity misval- uation is driven at least in part by investors’ failure to fully recognize and adequately price the optionality of equity. It has long been recognized in the ﬁnance literature that the equity of a ﬁrm with debt in its capital structure is",

    "title": "Equity Premia as Low as Three Percent?",
    "abstract": "The returns earned by U.S. Equities since 1926 exceed estimates derived from theory, from other periods and markets, and from surveys of institutional inves- tors. Rather than examine historic experience, we estimate the equity premium from the discount rate that equates market valuations with prevailing expecta- tions of future flows. The accounting flows we project are isomorphic to projected dividends but use more available information and narrow the range of reasonable growth rates. For each year between 1985 and 1998, we find that the equity pre- mium is around three percent (or less) in the United States and five other markets. THE Equity Risk Premium Lies at the core of financial economics. Representing the excess of the expected return on the stock market over the risk-free rate, the equity premium is unobservable and has been estimated using different approaches and samples. The estimates most commonly cited in the aca- demic literature are from Ibbotson Associates' annual reviews of the perfor- mance of various portfolios of U.S. Stocks and bonds since 1926. Those estimates lie in the region of seven to nine percent per year, depending on the specific series examined. This historic evidence is objective and easy to interpret and has convinced many, especially academic financial economists, that the Ibbotson estimates are the best available proxies for the equity premium (Welch (1999)).1 For discussion purposes, we use \"eight percent\" Inc.

    "title": "Equity Term Structures without Dividend Strips",
    "abstract": "We use a large cross section of equity returns to estimate a rich afﬁne model of eq- uity prices, dividends, returns, and their dynamics. Our model prices dividend strips of the market and equity portfolios without using strips data in the estimation. Yet model-implied equity yields closely match yields on traded strips. Our model extends equity term-structure data over time (to the 1970s) and across maturities, and gen- erates term structures for various equity portfolios. The novel cross section of term structures from our model covers 45 years and includes several recessions, providing a novel set of empirical moments to discipline asset pricing models. THE Term Structure OF Discount rates for risky assets plays an important role in many fundamental economic contexts. For example, pricing an asset with a speciﬁc horizon of cash ﬂows and evaluating an investment opportunity with a speciﬁc maturity requires knowing the maturity-speciﬁc discount rate. Investment in climate change mitigation, where the maturity of the project is especially long and therefore the long end of the term structure is especially important, is one well-known example.

    "title": "Equity Volatility and Corporate Bond Yields",
    "abstract": "This paper explores the effect of equity volatility on corporate bond yields. Pa- nel data for the late 1990s show that idiosyncratic firm-level volatility can ex- plain as much cross-sectional variation in yields as can credit ratings. This finding, together with the upward trend in idiosyncratic equity volatility docu- mented by Campbell, Lettau, Malkiel, and Xu (2001), helps to explain recent increases in corporate bond yields. During the late 1990s, the us. Equity and corporate bond markets behaved very differently. As displayed in Figure 1, stock prices rose strongly, while at the same time, corporate bonds performed poorly. The proximate cause of the low returns on corporate bonds was a tendency for the yields on both seasoned and newly is- sued corporate bonds to increase relative to the yields of U.S. Treasury securities. These increases in corporate-Treasury yield spreads are striking because they occurred at a time when stock prices were rising; the optimism of stock market investors did not seem to be shared by investors in the corporate bond market. There are several reasons why the prices of corporate bonds might diverge from the prices of corporate equities. First, stock prices will increase if investors become more optimistic about future corporate profits. Optimistic expectations benefit stock prices much more than bond prices, since stockholders receive all residual profits, while corporate bondholders receive no more than the promised payments of principal a",

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel approach to estimating latent oil risk factors and establish their signiﬁcance in pricing nonoil securities. Our model, which features four factors with simple economic interpretations, is estimated using both derivative prices and oil-related equity returns. The ﬁt is excellent in and out of sample. The extracted oil factors carry signiﬁcant risk premia, and are signiﬁcantly related to macroeconomic variables as well as portfolio returns sorted on characteristics and industry. The average nonoil portfolio exhibits a sensitivity to the oil factors amounting to a sixth (in magnitude) of that of the oil industry itself. FEW, IF ANY, Commodities have been the focus of more attention for their per- ceived economic signiﬁcance than oil. While there is strong evidence relating oil prices to the business cycle, the nature of the relationship is nonlinear, time- varying, and difﬁcult to attribute to any single source such as political uncer- tainty, cartel decisions, or global economic conditions (see Hamilton (2003)a n d Barsky and Kilian (2004)).

    "title": "Estimating Private Equity Returns from Limited",
    "abstract": "We introduce a methodology to estimate the historical time series of returns to invest- ment in private equity funds. The approach requires only an unbalanced panel of cash contributions and distributions accruing to limited partners and is robust to sparse data. We decompose private equity returns from 1994 to 2015 into a component due to traded factors and a time-varying private equity premium not spanned by publicly traded factors. We ﬁnd cyclicality in private equity returns that differs according to fund type and is consistent with the conjecture that capital market segmentation contributes to private equity returns. Private Equity (PE) IS A Major institutional asset class and represents a sig- niﬁcant fraction of investments by colleges, foundations, pension funds, and sovereign wealth funds, among others. A major drawback of PE for purposes of analysis is the lack of transactions-based performance measures. This greatly hampers portfolio allocation choice, which typically requires information about the risk, return, and covariance of asset classes. In liquid markets these es- timates can be derived from statistical analysis of time series returns. Most PE time series, however, are based on nonmarket valuations or on multiyear internal rates of return broken down by fund vintage years. The primary contribution of this paper is the introduction of a methodol- ogy based on Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (mcmc) to estimate a time series of PE returns using cash ﬂows acc",

    "abstract": "We present a method to estimate the gains from trade in limit-order markets and pro- vide empirical evidence that the limit-order market is a good market design. Using observations on order submissions and execution and cancellation histories, we esti- mate both the distribution of traders’ unobserved valuations for the stock and latent trader arrival rates. We use the resulting estimates to compute the current gains from trade, the gains from trade in a perfectly liquid market, and the gains from trade with a monopoly liquidity supplier. The current gains are 90% of the maximum gains and 150% of the monopolist gains. THE Majority OF THE World ’S Stock Exchanges operate some form of a limit-order market. A feature of good market design is that traders realize most of the potential gains from trade. We develop a method for identifying and estimating the gains from trade in a limit-order market and apply our method to a sample from a particular limit-order market, the Vancouver Stock Exchange (VSE). We find that gains from trade in the VSE are approximately 90% of the gains from trade in a perfectly liquid market and approximately 50% more than gains from trade in a market in which liquidity is supplied by a profit-maximizing monopolist. Our results therefore provide new empirical evidence that the limit- order market is a good market design. A large number of experimental studies document that the gains from trade in a double auction are close to the maximum gains from trade.",

    "title": "Estimating the Intertemporal Risk–Return",
    "abstract": "We argue that the implied cost of capital (ICC), computed using earnings forecasts, is useful in capturing time variation in expected stock returns. First, we show theoreti- cally that ICC is perfectly correlated with the conditional expected stock return under plausible conditions. Second, our simulations show that ICC is helpful in detecting an intertemporal risk–return relation, even when earnings forecasts are poor. Finally, in empirical analysis, we construct the time series of ICC for the G-7 countries. We find a positive relation between the conditional mean and variance of stock returns, at both the country level and the world market level. THE Tradeoff Between Risk and return is a central concept in finance. Finance theory generally predicts a positive risk–return relation, both across assets and over time. For example, the intertemporal capital asset pricing model (icapm) of Merton (1973) predicts a positive time-series relation between the conditional mean and variance of market returns. However, the empirical evidence on the sign of the intertemporal risk–return relation is inconclusive. To explain the mixed nature of the evidence, some researchers have shown that the intertemporal mean–variance relation need not be positive theoret- ically (e.g., Abel (1988), Backus and Gregory (1993), and Whitelaw (2000)). Others have argued that a positive mean–variance relation emerges when the empirical specification includes hedging demands (e.g., Scruggs (1998) and Guo and",

    "abstract": "We ﬁnd that several recently proposed consumption-based models of stock returns, when evaluated using an optimal set of managed portfolios and the associated model- implied conditional moment restrictions, fail to capture key features of risk premiums in equity markets. To arrive at these conclusions, we construct an optimal Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimator for models in which the stochastic discount factor (SDF) is a conditionally afﬁne function of a set of priced risk factors, and we show that there is an optimal choice of managed portfolios to use in testing a null model against a proposed alternative generalized SDF. A Large AND Growing Literature explores the goodness-of-ﬁt of dynamic as- set pricing models in which the stochastic discount factor (SDF) takes the conditionally afﬁne form mt+1(θ0) = φ0 t (θ0) + φ f ′ t (θ0) ft+1, where f is the vector of observed “priced” risk factors, the factor weights (φ0 t ,φ f ′ t ) are in the mod- eler’s information setJt,a n dθ0 is an unknown vector of parameters. SDFs of this form are implicit in conditional versions of the classical Capm and its multifactor extensions (as posited, e.g., in Fama and French (1996) and Ja- gannathan and Wang (1996), and explored empirically in Hodrick and Zhang (2001)).

    "abstract": "We test whether the frequency of feedback information about the performance of an investment portfolio and the flexibility with which the investor can change the portfolio influence her risk attitude in markets. In line with the prediction of myopic loss aversion (Benartzi and Thaler (1995)), we find that more information and more flexibility result in less risk taking. Market prices of risky assets are significantly higher if feedback frequency and decision flex- ibility are reduced. This result supports the findings from individual decision making, and shows that market interactions do not eliminate such behavior or its consequences for prices. IN February 1999, Bank Hapoalim, Israel's largest mutual funds manager, announced that it intended to change its information policy towards its client-investors. The bank would send information about the performance of its funds not every month as it had in the past, but rather only once every three months. Clients would still be able to check the performance every day if they chose, but if they did not, they would get the information less frequently than before. The bank expected investors to be more willing to hold assets in the mutual fund when they are less frequently informed about the evolution of fund prices. The bank's argument was that \"investors should not be scared by the occasional drop in prices.\"1 The bank's argument corresponds closely to the concept of myopic loss aversion (MLA) advanced by Benartzi and Thaler (1995).",

    "abstract": "We provide evidence that firms attempting IPOs condition offer terms and the decision whether to carry through with an offering on the experience of their primary market contemporaries. Moreover, while initial returns and IPO vo- lume are positively correlated in the aggregate, the correlation is negative among contemporaneous offerings subject to a common valuation factor. Our findings are consistent with investment banks implicitly bundling offerings subject to a common valuation factor to achieve more equitable internaliza- tion of information production costs and thereby preventing coordination fail- ures in primary equity markets. IN THE Second Half OF 1999, at the height of the \"dot.com\" wave, 282 firms went public in the United States. In the first half of 2001, only 46 firms went public. Ibbotson and Ritter (1995) document similar boom and bust patterns going back to 1960. Coupled with this pattern is the tendency for large initial returns during \"hot\" markets (Lowry and Schwert (2002)). Benveniste et al.

    "title": "Evidence on the Beneﬁts",
    "abstract": "Alternative mortgage products have been identiﬁed by many as culprits in the ﬁ- nancial crisis. However, because of their lower initial mortgage payments relative to loan amount, they may be a valuable tool for households that expect higher and more certain future labor income, and that wish to smooth consumption over the life-cycle. Using U.K. Household-level panel data, this paper provides evidence in support of this hypothesis and highlights other important beneﬁts of alternative mortgages, in- cluding portfolio diversiﬁcation, tax beneﬁts, and a reduction in the transaction costs incurred in housing transactions. THE Purchase OF A house is the single most important investment decision that many households make during their lifetime. The value of the house generally exceeds the net worth of the household, which ﬁnances its homeownership through a mortgage contract. Other ﬁnancial assets and liabilities are typi- cally far less important than the house and its associated mortgage contract. Therefore, the form of the mortgage contract can have large effects on house- holds’ ability to manage their lifetime resources. The form of the mortgage contract assumes particular relevance since, in the decade leading up to the global ﬁnancial crisis of 2007 to 2009, there was a substantial increase in the types of mortgages available to U.S. House- holds. These mortgages are broadly classiﬁed as alternative mortgage products (AMPs), since they involve ﬁnancial instruments that are dif",

    "title": "Ex Ante Skewness and Expected Stock Returns",
    "abstract": "We use option prices to estimate ex ante higher moments of the underlying individual securities’ risk-neutral returns distribution. We ﬁnd that individual securities’ risk-neutral volatility, skewness, and kurtosis are strongly related to future returns. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd a negative (positive) relation between ex ante volatility (kurtosis) and subsequent returns in the cross-section, and more ex ante negatively (positively) skewed returns yield subsequent higher (lower) returns. We analyze the extent to which these returns relations represent compensation for risk and ﬁnd evidence that, even after controlling for differences in co-moments, individual securities’ skewness matters. Models Implying That Investors consider higher moments in returns have a long history in the literature. Researchers such asRubinstein (1973)and Kraus and Litzenberger (1976, 1983) develop models of expected returns that incor- porate skewness. In these models, the higher moments that are relevant for individual securities are co-moments with the aggregate market portfolio. More recent, empirical work provides evidence that higher moments of the return dis- tribution are important in pricing securities. Consistent with the models’ focus on co-moments, the tests in these papers ask whether a security’s co-skewness or co-kurtosis with the market is priced; historical returns data are typically used to measure these co-moments. For example, Harvey and Siddique (2000) explore both skewness and co-skewn",

    "title": "Ex-Dividend Proﬁtability and Institutional",
    "abstract": "We use institutional trading data to examine whether skilled institutions exploit posi- tive abnormal ex-dividend returns. Results show that institutions concentrate trading around certain ex-dates, and earn higher proﬁts around these events. Dividend cap- ture trades represent 6% of all institutional buy trades but contribute 15% of overall abnormal returns. Institutional dividend capture trading is persistent. Institutional ex-day proﬁtability is also strongly cross-sectionally related to trade execution skill. The relation between execution skill and proﬁts disappears around placebo non-ex- days. Results suggest that skilled institutions target certain opportunities rather than beneﬁting uniformly over time. Furthermore, only skilled institutions can proﬁt from dividend capture. Prior Literature Shows That TRADERSwho are able to execute trades at favor- able prices may earn abnormal proﬁts (see, e.g., Perold (1988), Anand et al. (2012)). In this paper, we examine whether institutions that exhibit this type of skill (“trade execution skill”) beneﬁt from lower execution costs uniformly over time, or whether they target speciﬁc opportunities to exploit this skill. We identify a relatively unique opportunity for institutions with execution skill to realize abnormal proﬁts: dividend capture. Ex-day prices decline on average by an amount less than the dividend, generating positive pre-tax ex-day returns (e.g., Elton and Gruber (1970), Graham, Michaely, and Roberts (2003), Zhang,",

    "title": "Excess Capacity, Marginalq, and Corporate",
    "abstract": "Theory posits that when managers anticipate excess capacity , averageq becomes a biased estimator of marginalq as the potential for underutilizing new capital reduces the marginal beneﬁt of investing. After correcting for this source of measurement error, the explanatory power of Tobin’sq substantially improves in time-series and cross-sectional regressions as well as in out-of-sample tests. These ﬁndings, together with a secular erosion in capacity utilization, help explain why corporate investment rates have been declining for decades despite averageq increasing signiﬁcantly . Our analysis indicates that economic rigidities have contributed to the persistent erosion in capacity utilization. Tobin ’S Q IS Often Characterized as the most widely accepted determi- nant of corporate investment (Erickson and Whited (2006)). The theory is straightforward: ﬁrms should invest more aggressively when the market value of the ﬁrm is high relative to its replacement value (Tobin (1969) and Hayashi (1982)). The logic underlying Tobin’sq is economically compelling, and hence the theory has spawned a large literature. Casual observation of the data, however, is seemingly at odds with the model’s central prediction. Although averageq has been generally increasing over time, the rate of aggregate corporate investment spending has been de- clining (e.g., Jones and Philippon (2016), Alexander and Eberly (2018), and sations with seminar participants at Cambridge, Colorado, Drexel, Florida, Insea",

    "abstract": "We propose that the limited financial development of emerging markets is a significant factor behind the large share of dollar-denominated external debt present in these markets. We show that when financial constraints affect bor- rowing and lending between domestic agents, agents undervalue insuring against an exchange rate depreciation. Since more of this insurance is present when external debt is denominated in domestic currency rather than in dol- lars, this result implies that domestic agents choose excessive dollar debt. We also show that limited financial development reduces the incentives for foreign lenders to enter emerging markets. The retarded entry reinforces the underinsurance problem. Although Observers Still Debate THE Causes underlying recent emerging markets' crises, one factor they agree on is that domestic firms' contracting of external debt in dollars as opposed to domestic currency creates balance sheet mis- matches that lead to bankruptcies and dislocations.1 The evidence is that most contracts between foreign lenders and borrowers in emerging markets take the form of dollar debt (see Hausmann, Panizza, and Stein (2001)). However, although foreign lenders must eventually be repaid in dol- lars, in principle, there is no reason that these payments cannot be contingent on the exchange rate. For example, contingencies can be added explicitly by index- ing debt contracts, or implicitly, by foreign lenders receiving domestic currency payments that they then",

    "abstract": "About a third of the assets in large retirement savings plans are invested in com- pany stock, and about a quarter of the discretionary contributions are invested in company stock. From a diversification perspective, this is a dubious strategy. This paper explores the role of excessive extrapolation in employees' company stock holdings. I find that employees of firms that experienced the worst stock perfor- mance over the last 10 years allocate 10.37 percent of their discretionary contri- butions to company stock, whereas employees whose firms experienced the best stock performance allocate 39.70 percent. Allocations to company stock, however, do not predict future performance. Roughly A Third OF THE Assets in large retirement savings plans are invested in company stock (i.e., stocks issued by the employing firm). In extreme cases, such as Coca-Cola, the allocation to company stock reaches 90 percent of the plan assets. From a diversification perspective, it is even more puz- zling that Coca-Cola employees allocate 76 percent of their own discretion- ary contributions to Coca-Cola shares. This strategy seems dubious, and it is in complete contrast to Markowitz (1952) and Sharpe (1964), who predict that people will hold well-diversified portfolios. This paper examines whether excessive extrapolation of past returns could explain at least part of the discretionary allocations to company stock.1 The empirical analysis utilizes a unique database of SEC filings that describes the",

We use prices, quantities, and product characteristics for differentiated products, coupled with a dis- crete choice framework and an assumption of price competition, to estimate marginal costs for all producers. Using a Monte Carlo approach we generate counterfactual prices and profits for different levels of exchange rates. We illustrate the method us- ing the market for bottled water. Our results stress that even in a relatively simple market such as this one, different brands face very different exchange rate risks. Consider A Firm That Produces a good in France, using mainly local inputs, and sells it abroad in locations that have a floating exchange rate vis-`a-vis the euro. Profits, and in turn the value of the firm, are potentially exposed to exchange rate changes. If the euro appreciates, profits when measured in euros are likely to decrease. How large is the decrease in profits? Similarly, what is the impact of such an exchange rate change on the profits of an import-competing firm? These are the questions that a large literature on exchange rate exposure attempts to answer. The classic treatment on exchange rate exposure is that of Adler and Dumas (1984), who show that exposure can be defined as the regression coefficient on the exchange rate in a linear regression of the value of the firm.

We show that these excess returns (i) are higher for currencies with higher interest rate differentials vis-`a-vis the United States, (ii) increase with uncertainty about monetary policy, and (iii) increase further when the Federal Reserve adopts a policy of monetary easing. We interpret these ex- cess returns as compensation for monetary policy uncertainty within a parsimonious model of constrained ﬁnanciers who intermediate global demand for currencies. Announcements BY THE Federal Open Market Committee (fomc) are among the most highly anticipated events by investors around the world. These an- nouncements, which occur regularly at prespeciﬁed dates, serve as the Federal Reserve’s main channel for communicating its monetary policy decisions to the market. Given the close link between currency markets and monetary policy, it is only natural to expect that Fomc announcements can have large impacts on exchange rates. The active nature of the currency markets (with a daily turnover of over ﬁve trillion U.S. Dollars) coupled with high market concen- tration and participants’ ability to operate with high leverage ratios means that even small price movements in this market can potentially translate into economically signiﬁcant effects.

    "abstract": "By examining how executive compensation structure determines corporate acqui- sition decisions, we document a strong positive relation between acquiring man- agers’ equity-based compensation ~EBC! And stock price performance around and following acquisition announcements. This relation is highly robust when we con- trol for acquisition mode ~mergers!, means of payment, managerial ownership, and previous option grants. Compared to low EBC managers, high EBC managers pay lower acquisition premiums, acquire targets with higher growth opportunities, and make acquisitions engendering larger increases in firm risk. EBC significantly explains postacquisition stock price performance even after controlling for acqui- sition mode, means of payment, and “glamour” versus “value” acquirers. Corporate Investment Decisions ARE Important to the creation of shareholder wealth. Whereas most investments are small relative to the size of the firm, mergers and acquisitions are major, externally observable, and discretionary long-term investments. 1 These transactions also present managers with op- portunities that can exacerbate the potential for conflicts of interest be- tween managers and shareholders. Thus, corporate acquisitions present an ideal setting to explore the relation between managerial incentives and the efficiency of managerial investment decisions.

    "abstract": "Executive compensation inﬂuences managerial risk preferences through executives’ portfolio sensitivities to changes in stock prices (delta) and stock return volatility (vega). Large deltas discourage managerial risk-taking, while large vegas encourage risk-taking. Theory suggests that short-maturity debt mitigates agency costs of debt by constraining managerial risk preferences. We posit and ﬁnd evidence of a negative (positive) relation between CEO portfolio deltas (vegas) and short-maturity debt. We also ﬁnd that short-maturity debt mitigates the inﬂuence of vega- and delta-related incentives on bond yields. Overall, our empirical evidence shows that short-term debt mitigates agency costs of debt arising from compensation risk. THE USE OF Stock- and option-based executive compensation has increased dra- matically during the past few decades. The median exposure of CEO wealth to stock prices tripled between 1980 and 1994 (Hall and Liebman (1998)), and then doubled again between 1994 and 2000 (Bergstresser and Philippon (2006)). Such changes in executive compensation have a direct impact on the manager’s exposure to risk, thus altering both incentives and behavior. Car- penter (2000) and Lambert, Larcker, and Verrecchia (1991) discuss two effects of compensation on managerial incentives. One effect is caused by the sen- sitivity of compensation to stock prices (delta). A second effect is caused by the sensitivity of compensation to stock return volatility (vega). The higher t",

    "abstract": "We test whether executive stock ownership affects firm payouts using the 2003 divi- dend tax cut to identify an exogenous change in the after-tax value of dividends. We find that executives with higher ownership were more likely to increase dividends after the tax cut in 2003, whereas no relation is found in periods when the dividend tax rate was higher. Relative to previous years, firms that initiated dividends in 2003 were more likely to reduce repurchases. The stock price reaction to the tax cut sug- gests that the substitution of dividends for repurchases may have been anticipated, consistent with agency conflicts. Shareholder Payouts Have Changed DRAMATICALLYover the past two decades, with dividend payout ratios falling substantially and share repurchases increasing rapidly (Fama and French (2001), Grullon and Michaely (2002)). Following the dividend tax cut in the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act (jgtrra) of May 2003, however, dividend activity increased sharply, particularly the number of dividend initiations (e.g., Blouin, Raedy, and Shackelford (2004), Chetty and Saez (2005)). 1 The dividend tax cut represented a large increase in the after-tax value of dividends to individual investors, as the top marginal tax rate on dividends was cut over 20 percentage points, from 38.6% to 15%. This tax change moved from initial proposal to signed law in under 5 months, and thus was largely unanticipated prior to 2003. Because this tax cut is an exogenous increase in",

    "abstract": "While many firms grant executive stock options that can be repriced, other firms systematically restrict or prohibit repricing. This article investigates the determi- nants of firms’ repricing policies and the consequences of such policies for executive turnover and retention. Firms that have better internal governance, that use more powerful stock-based incentives, or that face less shareholder scrutiny are more likely to maintain repricing flexibility. Firms that restrict repricing are more vulnerable to voluntary executive turnover following stock price declines. When share price declines are severe, restricting firms appear to award unusually large numbers of new options. THE Past Several Years have witnessed tremendous growth in the use of stock options to compensate corporate executives. Indeed, virtually all of the largest publicly traded U.S. Firms now rely on stock option plans, and option grants con- stitute more than half of the annual pay for chief executive officers (Murphy (1999)). A natural consequence of this growth has been an increasing aware- ness and sophistication among academics, practitioners, and the popular press about how the design and administration of option plans can help to enhance or destroy shareholder value. Although a number of corporate practices pertaining to executive options have elicited controversy, perhaps no such practice has been more controver- sial than “repricing,” which involves effectively lowering the exercise prices of previo",

Making the proportion of options that vest a gradually increasing function of the stock price can ensure that appropriate numbers of options are retained while they provide risk-taking incentives, but are exercised once they have lost their convexity. “Progressive performance vesting” can allow the firm more efficiently to rebalance the manager’s risk-taking incentives.

We refer to such options as “calendar vesting” stock options, to stress that it is the mere passage of time that causes them to vest. In contrast, “performance vesting” stock options vest contingent on the achievement of a performance hurdle, which is often defined in terms of an accounting measure of profitability or stock price appreciation.

    "abstract": "Recent theory posits a new governance channel available to blockholders: threat of exit. Threat of exit, as opposed to actual exit, is difﬁcult to measure directly . However, a crucial property is that it is weaker when stock liquidity is lower and vice versa. We use natural experiments of ﬁnancial crises and decimalization as exogenous shocks to stock liquidity . Firms with larger blockholdings experience greater declines (in- creases) in ﬁrm value during the crises (decimalization), particularly if the manager’s wealth is sensitive to the stock price and thus to exit threats. Additional tests suggest exit threats are distinct from blockholder intervention. Traditional Theories OF Blockholder governance focus primarily on block- holder intervention in management decisions. However, recent theories posit that blockholders can govern ﬁrms even when they have no intervention power. These theories view blockholders as informed traders who control manage- ment through “exit,” that is, selling a ﬁrm’s stock based on private information (Admati and Pﬂeiderer (2009), Edmans (2009), Edmans and Manso (2011)). Blockholder exit in these models exerts downward pressure on the stock price, which hurts management through its equity interest in the ﬁrm. Management therefore wants to make sure its actions are such that blockholders are willing to stay with the ﬁrm.

    "abstract": "Using ﬁve-year credit default swap (CDS) spreads on 2,364 companies in 54 countries from 2004 to 2011, we ﬁnd that ﬁrms exposed to stronger property rights through their foreign asset positions (institutional channel) and ﬁrms cross-listed on exchanges with stricter disclosure requirements (informational channel) reduce their CDS spreads by 40 bps for a one-standard-deviation increase in their exposure to the two channels. These channels capture effects beyond those associated with ﬁrm- and country-level fundamentals. Overall, we ﬁnd that ﬁrm-level global asset and information connec- tions are important mechanisms to delink ﬁrms from their sovereign and country risks. TO What Extent CAN Private Sector ﬁrms delink themselves from sovereign risk? It is well known that while governments play an important role in ﬁnan- cial markets, they can also generate externalities arising from their actions and their ability to compel and proscribe. For example, governments suffering from large budget deﬁcits and slow economic growth may limit the ability of private sector ﬁrms to service their external debt obligations. Budget deﬁcits may also presage increases in corporate taxes or other corporate infringements, increasing potential default risks.1 In the aftermath of the recent global credit risk crisis, where sovereign credit default swap (CDS) spreads rose dramati- cally from an average of 30 bps to above 250 bps in 2008 and remained above 100 bps thereafter (see Figure1), there is inc",

    "abstract": "We investigate the expectations hypotheses of the term structure of interest rates and of the foreign exchange market using vector autoregressive methods for U.S. Dollar, Deutsche mark, and British pound interest rates and exchange rates. We examine Wald, Lagrange multiplier, and distance metric tests by iterating on ap- proximate solutions that require only matrix inversions. Bias-corrected, con- strained VARs provide Monte Carlo simulations. Wald tests grossly overreject the null, Lagrange multiplier tests slightly underreject, and distance metric tests overreject. A common interpretation emerges from the small sample statistics. The evidence against the expectations hypotheses is much less strong than under asymptotic inference. According TO THE Expectations Hypothesis, information in current interest rates provides the conditional expectation of future asset prices. The expec- tations hypothesis of the term structure of interest rates (eh-ts) states that the current term spread between a long-term interest rate and a short-term interest rate is the expected value of a weighted average of the expected future changes in the short-term interest rate. This theory, popularized in the writings of Fisher (1930), Keynes (1930), and Hicks (1953), continues to be a way that many economists think about the determination of long-term interest rates.

I estimate the magnitude of the ﬁrst component for short- and long-maturity Treasury bonds. At a quarterly frequency, variances of news about expected inﬂation account for between 10% to 20% of variances of yield shocks. Standard dynamic models with long-run risk imply variance ratios close to 1. Habit formation models fare somewhat better. The magnitudes of shocks to real rates and expected excess returns cannot be determined reliably. A Large AND Expanding LITERATUREexplores the relation between nominal bond yields and inﬂation. In a particularly important contribution, Ang and Piazzesi (2003) introduce Gaussian macro-ﬁnance dynamic term structure models to determine the compensation investors require to face shocks to inﬂation and macroeconomic activity. Subsequent studies have branched out to include un- spanned macro risks, non-Gaussian dynamics, and fundamental explanations for inﬂation risk premia that are grounded in investor preferences and New Keynesian macro models.

    "title": "Expected Option Returns",
    "abstract": "This paper examines expected option returns in the context of mainstream asset- pricing theory. Under mild assumptions, expected call returns exceed those of the underlying security and increase with the strike price. Likewise, expected put re- turns are below the risk-free rate and increase with the strike price. S&P index option returns consistently exhibit these characteristics. Under stronger assump- tions, expected option returns vary linearly with option betas. However, zero-beta, at-the-money straddle positions produce average losses of approximately three per- cent per week. This suggests that some additional factor, such as systematic sto- chastic volatility, is priced in option returns. Asset-pricing Theory Claims that options, like all other risky securities in an economy, compensate their holders with expected returns that are in accor- dance with the systematic risks they require their holders to bear. Options which deliver payoffs in bad states of the world will earn lower returns than those that deliver their payoffs in good states. The enormous popularity of option contracts has arisen, in part, because options allow investors to pre- cisely tailor their risks to their preferences.

    "title": "Explaining the Diversification Discount",
    "abstract": "This paper argues that the documented discount on diversified firms is not per se evidence that diversification destroys value. Firms choose to diversify. We use three alternative econometric techniques to control for the endogeneity of the diversifi- cation decision, and find evidence supporting the self-selection of diversifying firms. We find a strong negative correlation between a firm's choice to diversify and firm value. The diversification discount always drops, and sometimes turns into a pre- mium. There also exists evidence of self-selection by refocusing firms. These re- sults point to the importance of explicitly modeling the endogeneity of the diversification status in analyzing its effect on firm value. Firms choose to diversify. They choose to diversify when the benefits of di- versification outweigh the costs of diversification and stay focused when they do not. The characteristics of firms that diversify, which make the ben- efits of diversification greater than the costs of diversification, may also cause firms to be discounted. A proper evaluation of the effect of diversifi- cation on firm value should take into account the firm-specific characteris- tics that bear both on firm value and on the decision to diversify.

    "title": "Explaining the Magnitude of Liquidity Premia:",
    "abstract": "Constantinides (1986) documents how the impact of transaction costs on per-annum liquidity premia in the standard dynamic allocation problem with i.i.d. Returns is an order of magnitude smaller than the cost rate itself. Recent papers form portfolios sorted on liquidity measures and ﬁnd spreads in expected per-annum return that are the same order of magnitude as the transaction cost spread. When we allow returns to be predictable and introduce wealth shocks calibrated to labor income, transaction costs are able to produce per-annum liquidity premia that are the same order of magnitude as the transaction cost spread. A Number OF Recent PAPERShave found a difference in expected return across portfolios sorted on liquidity measures. While the ﬁnding of a difference is not surprising, the magnitude is, with expected return differences on the order of 6% to 7% per annum.1 The magnitude of the difference seems too large to be explained by realistic transaction costs. In particular, the seminal work of Constantinides (1986) documents how investor utility is largely insensitive to transaction costs when the investor solves the canonical problem of i.i.d. Returns calibrated to U.S. Data, no nonﬁnancial income, and a constant propor- tional cost rate. For realistic proportional costs, Constantinides shows that the per-annum liquidity premium that must be offered to induce a constant relative risk aversion (crra) investor to hold the transaction-cost asset instead of an otherwise identi",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this article is to explain the spread between rates on corporate and government bonds. We show that expected default accounts for a surprisingly small fraction of the premium in corporate rates over treasuries. While state taxes ex- plain a substantial portion of the difference, the remaining portion of the spread is closely related to the factors that we commonly accept as explaining risk premiums for common stocks. Both our time series and cross-sectional tests support the ex- istence of a risk premium on corporate bonds. THE Purpose OF This Article is to examine and explain the differences in the rates offered on corporate bonds and those offered on government bonds ~spreads!, and, in particular, to examine whether there is a risk premium in corporate bond spreads and, if so, why it exists. Spreads in rates between corporate and government bonds differ across rating classes and should be positive for each rating class for the following reasons: 1. Expected default loss—some corporate bonds will default and investors require a higher promised payment to compensate for the expected loss from defaults. 2. Tax premium—interest payments on corporate bonds are taxed at the state level whereas interest payments on government bonds are not. 3. Risk premium—The return on corporate bonds is riskier than the re- turn on government bonds, and investors should require a premium for the higher risk. As we will show, this occurs because a large part of the risk on corporat",

    "title": "Explicit versus Implicit Contracts: Evidence",
    "abstract": "We report evidence on the determinants of whether the relationship between a firm and its Chief Executive Officer (CEO) is governed by an explicit (written) or an im- plicit agreement. We find that fewer than half of the CEOs of S&P 500 firms have comprehensive explicit employment agreements. Consistent with contracting theory, explicit agreements are more likely to be observed and are likely to have a longer du- ration in situations in which the sustainability of the relationship is less certain and where the expected loss to the CEO is greater if the firm fails to honor the agreement. When A Firm Hires a Chief Executive Officer (CEO), it enters into a complex relationship that has significant long-term implications for its stockholders. Establishing the terms of this relationship requires determining the CEO’s responsibilities, compensation, perquisites, and term of employment, the con- ditions under which either party can sever the relationship, and restrictions on the CEO’s outside activities, among other considerations. Despite the com- plexity of these arrangements, many public companies, including some of the largest, choose not to put such terms in writing. In 2000, less than half of the firms in the S&P 500 had a comprehensive written (or explicit) employment agreement (EA) with their CEOs. The other firms had either no written agree- ment at all or agreements that covered only limited aspects of their relationship with the CEO, such as change of control, nondisclosu",

    "title": "Exploring the Nature of “Trader Intuition”",
    "abstract": "Experimental evidence has consistently conﬁrmed the ability of uninformed traders, even novices, to infer information from the trading process. After contrasting brain activation in subjects watching markets with and without insiders, we hypothesize that Theory of Mind (ToM) helps explain this pattern, where ToM refers to the human capacity to discern malicious or benevolent intent. We ﬁnd that skill in predicting price changes in markets with insiders correlates with scores on two ToM tests. We document GARCH-like persistence in transaction price changes that may help investors read markets when there are insiders. This Paper Reports Results From Experiments meant to explore how unin- formed traders read information from transaction prices and order ﬂow in ﬁ- nancial markets with insiders. Since the seminal experiments of Charles Plott and Shyam Sunder in the early 1980s (Plott and Sunder (1988)), it has been repeatedly conﬁrmed (as we will do here too) that uninformed traders are quite capable of quickly inferring the signals that informed traders (insiders) have about future dividends, despite anonymity of the trading process, despite a lack of structural knowledge of the situation, and despite the absence of long histories from which they can learn the market’s statistical regularities. It is striking that so little is understood about the ability of the uninformed to infer the signals of others. This ability constitutes the basis of the efﬁ- cient markets hypothesis (Fam",

    "title": "Exponential Growth Bias and Household Finance",
    "abstract": "Exponential growth bias is the pervasive tendency to linearize exponential functions when assessing them intuitively. We show that exponential growth bias can explain two stylized facts in household finance: the tendency to underestimate an interest rate given other loan terms, and the tendency to underestimate a future value given other investment terms. Bias matters empirically: More-biased households borrow more, save less, favor shorter maturities, and use and benefit more from financial advice, conditional on a rich set of household characteristics. There is little evidence that our measure of exponential growth bias merely proxies for broader financial sophistication. What Drives Household financial decisions? The canonical economic model as- sumes that consumers choose to consume, borrow, or save based on their prefer- ences, their expectations, and the costs and benefits of borrowing and saving. A growing body of work applies insights from psychology to enrich specifications of three of the model’s key pieces: preferences, expectations, and problem-solving conditional on parameter values. 1 In this paper, we bring psychological evi- dence to bear on a fourth specification issue: How consumers perceive the costs and benefits of borrowing and saving. We begin by tying together existing and new evidence on these cost percep- tions to show that most consumers err systematically when given information commonly available in the market.

    "abstract": "Using exogenous liquidity windfalls from oil and natural gas shale discoveries, we demonstrate that bank branch networks help integrate U.S. Lending markets. Banks exposed to shale booms enjoy liquidity inﬂows, which increase their capacity to origi- nate and hold new loans. Exposed banks increase mortgage lending in nonboom coun- ties, but only where they have branches and only for hard-to-securitize mortgages. Our ﬁndings suggest that contracting frictions limit the ability of arm’s length ﬁnance to integrate credit markets fully. Branch networks continue to play an important role in ﬁnancial integration, despite the development of securitization markets. Over THE Past 30 Years, the banking system in the United States has gone through a signiﬁcant transformation, relying more on capital markets and direct ﬁnance in funding loans and less on local bank deposits. The U.S. Mort- gage market has been at the forefront of this transformation, with 52% of loans in 2011 ﬁnanced by securitization markets, up from 12% in 1980.1 Moreover, improvements in information technology have facilitated bank lending well outside of branch-based geographical domains (Petersen and Rajan (2002)). These changes have allowed capital to ﬂow across the U.S. Economy and thus integrate local credit markets. The greater role of external capital markets in facilitating access to credit should have diminished the value of bank branch networks for lending.

    "title": "External Networking and Internal Firm",
    "abstract": "We use panel data on S&P 1500 companies to identify external network connections between directors and CEOs. We ﬁnd that ﬁrms with more powerful CEOs are more likely to appoint directors with ties to the CEO. Using changes in board composition due to director death and retirement for identiﬁcation, we ﬁnd that CEO-director ties reduce ﬁrm value, particularly in the absence of other governance mechanisms to substitute for board oversight. Moreover, ﬁrms with more CEO-director ties engage in more value-destroying acquisitions. Overall, our results suggest that network ties with the CEO weaken the intensity of board monitoring. Executives AND Directors OF major corporations are linked in many ways. They may serve together on the board of directors of another company or they may have worked together, either as employees or directors, in the past. They may also be connected outside their employment networks. Executives may play golf at the same country clubs, attend Business Roundtable meetings together, or serve as trustees for the same charitable organizations. Or, they may have graduated from the same MBA programs. Such network connections between the management groups of different ﬁrms may increase value for shareholders by creating conduits through which valuable information can ﬂow from one ﬁrm to another. 1 However, pre-existing network connections between executives and directors within a ﬁrm may undermine independent corporate governance, reducing ﬁrm value.2 California a",

    "abstract": "Testing the hypothesis that international equity market correlation increases in volatile times is a difficult exercise and misleading results have often been re- ported in the past because of a spurious relationship between correlation and vol- atility. Using \"extreme value theory\" to model the multivariate distribution tails, we derive the distribution of extreme correlation for a wide class of return distri- butions. Empirically, we reject the null hypothesis of multivariate normality for the negative tail, but not for the positive tail. We also find that correlation is not related to market volatility per se but to the market trend. Correlation increases in bear markets, but not in bull markets. International Equity Market Correlation has been widely studied. Previous studies1 suggest that correlation is larger when focusing on large absolute- value returns, and that this seems more important in bear markets. The conclusion that international correlation is much higher in periods of vola- tile markets (large absolute returns) has indeed become part of the accepted wisdom among practitioners and the financial press. However, one should exert great care in testing such a proposition. The usual approach is to con- dition the estimated correlation on the observed (or ex post) realization of market returns. Unfortunately correlation is a complex function of returns and such tests can lead to wrong conclusions, unless the null hypothesis and professor of finance at Essec and an",

    "abstract": "I examine the sources of exchange rate dynamics by focusing on the information structure of FX trading. This structure permits the existence of an equilibrium distribution of transaction prices at a point in time. I develop and estimate a model of the price distribution using data from the Deutsche mark/dollar market that produces two striking results: (1) Much of the short-term volatility in exchange rates comes from sampling the heterogeneous trading decisions of dealers in a distribution that, under normal market conditions, changes comparatively slowly; (2) public news is rarely the predominant source of exchange rate movements over any horizon. THE Origins OF Nominal Exchange Rate Dynamics remain elusive. In particular, there is no widely accepted explanation for the sizable short- and medium- term movements in the dollar during the floating-rate period. More gener- ally, theoretical models relating exchange rates to macroeconomic fundamentals are still outperformed by simple time-series models in forecasting spot rates over short- and medium-term horizons (Frankel and Rose (1995)). This paper provides new perspective on the poor performance of exchange rate models by focusing on the information structure of trading between FX dealers in the spot market. I argue that equilibrium in this market at a point in time may be characterized by a distribution of transaction prices arising from dealers' trading decisions based on incomplete and heteroge- neous information.

Most factors are positively autocorrelated: the average factor earns a monthly return of six basis points following a year of losses and 51 basis points following a positive year. We ﬁnd that factor momentum concentrates in factors that explain more of the cross section of returns and that it is not incidental to individual stock momen- tum: momentum-neutral factors display more momentum. Momentum found in high- eigenvalue principal component factors subsumes most forms of individual stock mo- mentum. Our results suggest that momentum is not a distinct risk factor—it times other factors. Momentum Appears TO Violate THE efﬁcient market hypothesis in its weakest form.

    "abstract": "Multiple testing plagues many important questions in ﬁnance such as fund and fac- tor selection. We propose a new way to calibrate both Type I and Type II errors. Next, using a double-bootstrap method, we establish at-statistic hurdle that is associated with a speciﬁc false discovery rate (e.g., 5%). We also establish a hurdle that is as- sociated with a certain acceptable ratio of misses to false discoveries (Type II error scaled by Type I error), which effectively allows for differential costs of the two types of mistakes. Evaluating current methods, we ﬁnd that they lack power to detect out- performing managers. IN Manager Selection (OR, Equivalently , the selection of factors or trad- ing strategies), investors can make two types of mistakes. The ﬁrst involves selecting a manager who turns out to be unskilled—this is a Type I error, or a false positive.1 The second error is not selecting or missing a manager that the investor thought was unskilled but was not—this is a Type II error, or a false negative. Both types of errors display economically important variation. On the false positives side, for instance, one manager might slightly underper- form while another manager might have a large negative return. Moreover, the cost of a Type II error is likely different from the cost of a Type I error, with the costs depending on the speciﬁc decision at hand. However, while an investor may want to pick managers using the criterion that Type I errors are, say, ﬁve times more cost",

    "abstract": "This paper develops a simple technique that controls for “false discoveries,” or mutual funds that exhibit signiﬁcant alphas by luck alone. Our approach precisely separates funds into (1) unskilled, (2) zero-alpha, and (3) skilled funds, even with dependencies in cross-fund estimated alphas. We ﬁnd that 75% of funds exhibit zero alpha (net of expenses), consistent with the Berk and Green equilibrium. Further, we ﬁnd a signiﬁcant proportion of skilled (positive alpha) funds prior to 1996, but almost none by 2006. We also show that controlling for false discoveries substantially improves the ability to ﬁnd the few funds with persistent performance. Investors AND Academic Researchers have long searched for outperforming mutual fund managers. Although several researchers document negative av- erage fund alphas, net of expenses and trading costs (e.g., Jensen (1968), Elton et al.

    "abstract": "We present a model of succession in a firm owned and managed by its founder. The founder decides between hiring a professional manager or leaving man- agement to his heir, as well as on what fraction of the company to float on the stock exchange. We assume that a professional is a better manager than the heir, and describe how the founder's decision is shaped by the legal environ- ment. This theory of separation of ownership from management includes the Anglo-Saxon and the Continental European patterns of corporate governance as special cases, and generates additional empirical predictions consistent with cross-country evidence. Most Firms IN THE World are controlled by their founders, or by the founders' fa- milies and heirs. Such family ownership is nearly universal among privately held firms, but is also dominant among publicly traded firms. In Western Europe, South and East Asia, the Middle East, Latin America, and Africa, the vast ma- jority of publicly traded firms are family controlled (La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer (1999), Claessens, Djankov, and Lang (2000), European Corporate Governance Network (2001), Faccio and Lang (2002)). But even in the United States and the United Kingdom, some of the largest publicly traded firms, such as Wal-Mart Stores and Ford Motor, are controlled by families. A crucial issue in the discussion of family firms from the perspective of corpo- rate governance and finance is succession. For nearly every entrepreneurial firm that do",

    "title": "Favoritism in Mutual Fund Families? Evidence",
    "abstract": "We investigate whether mutual fund families strategically transfer performance across member funds to favor those more likely to increase overall family profits. We find that “high family value” funds (i.e., high fees or high past performers) over- perform at the expense of “low value” funds. Such a performance gap is above the one existing between similar funds not affiliated with the same family. Better allocations of underpriced initial public offering deals and opposite trades across member funds partly explain why high value funds overperform. Our findings highlight how the family organization prevalent in the mutual fund industry generates distortions in delegated asset management. ONE OF THE Most Striking Features of the U.S. Mutual funds industry is the preva- lence of the fund family organization. Virtually all mutual funds are affiliated with fund complexes and the top 50 fund families have steadily concentrated over 80% of all the equity assets under management. 1 This implies that most fund portfolio managers (e.g., Fidelity Contrafund’s manager) do not work di- rectly for their funds’ shareholders, but rather for a mutual fund organization (e.g., Fidelity Investments). Mutual fund families are potentially a source of value to investors but can also cause distortions to the incentives of fund managers.

    "abstract": "We study how investment fees vary within private equity funds. Net-of-fee return clustering suggests that most funds have two tiers of fees, and we decompose dif- ferences across tiers into both management- and performance-based fees. Managers of venture capital funds and those in high demand are less likely to use multiple fee schedules. Some investors consistently pay lower fees relative to others within their funds. Investor size, experience, and past performance explain some but not all of this effect, suggesting that unobserved traits like negotiation skill or bargaining power materially impact the fees that investors pay to access private markets. Investment IN Private Markets Through vehicles like private equity (PE) and venture capital (VC) has boomed over the past two decades and now exceeds $7.3 trillion (McKinsey (2021)).

    "title": "Feedback Effects and Asset Prices",
    "abstract": "Feedback effects from asset prices to firm cash flows have been empirically docu- mented. This finding raises a question for asset pricing: How are asset prices de- termined if price affects fundamental value, which in turn affects price? In this environment, by buying assets that others are buying, investors ensure high future cash flows for the firm and subsequent high returns for themselves. Hence, investors have an incentive to coordinate, which may generate self-fulfilling beliefs and multiple equilibria. Using insights from global games, we pin down investors’ beliefs, analyze equilibrium prices, and show that strong feedback leads to higher excess volatility. According TO Traditional Valuation Models , a firm’s stock price is determined by its exogenously given cash flow. However, recent finance literature ques- tions whether the cash flow is exogenous. For example, Subrahmanyam and Titman (2001) argue that a firm’s stock price affects how the firm is perceived by its customers, suppliers, employees, lenders, and other stakeholders. In turn, these perceptions influence purchase, supply, and investment decisions, which ultimately affect the firm’s cash flow. This direct feedback from asset prices to asset cash flows receives further support from recent empirical findings. In this paper, we allow for endogenous cash flows in an asset pricing model to address the following question: How do we determine asset prices in the pres- ence of feedback effects? Answering this que",

    "title": "Feedback Effects and Systematic Risk Exposures",
    "abstract": "We model the “feedback effect” of a ﬁrm’s stock price on investment in projects ex- posed to a systematic risk factor, like climate risk. The stock price reﬂects informa- tion about both the project’s cash ﬂows and its discount rate. A cash-ﬂow-maximizing manager treats discount rate ﬂuctuations as “noise,” but a price-maximizing manager interprets such variation as information about the project’s net present value. This difference qualitatively changes how investment behavior varies with the project’s risk exposure. Moreover, traditional objectives (e.g., cash ﬂow or price maximization) need not maximize welfare because they do not correctly account for hedging and risk-sharing beneﬁts of investment. Since Hayek (1945), IT HAS Been recognized that prices aggregate information that is dispersed across the economy and convey it to real decision makers. The “feedback effects” literature studies this mechanism in the context of corporate investment, emphasizing how asset prices reﬂect information about future investment opportunities, and how this information affects ﬁrms’ production and investment decisions (see Bond, Edmans, and Goldstein ( 2012) and Goldstein ( 2023) for insightful surveys). Existing anal- yses focus on the extent to which prices reﬂect information about future cash ﬂows and interpret noncash-ﬂow variation in prices as noise that needs to be ﬁltered out by decision makers.

    "abstract": "By considering yearly production growth rates for several manufacturing industries in more than 100 countries during (roughly) the last 40 years, we show that industries that are more dependent on external finance are hit harder during recessions. The observed difference in the behavior of industries is larger when financial frictions are thought to be more prevalent, linking the result directly to the financial mechanism hypothesis. In particular, more dependent industries are more strongly affected in recessions when they are located in countries with poor financial contractibility, and when their assets are softer or less protective of financiers. There IS A Large Literature That Studies the effect of a country’s financial de- velopment on the growth rate of output (see Levine (1997) for a survey). The overall conclusion of this literature is that financial markets and institutions have a positive and significant effect on long-run growth. Effort has been made toward establishing that causality goes effectively from financial to economic development and not the other way around. In particular, some recent papers analyze industry- and firm-level data in order to clarify the mechanisms that are sometimes obscured in cross-country studies (Demirg ¨uc ¸-Kunt and Maksi- movic (1998), Rajan and Zingales (1998)).

    "abstract": "This study classifies analysts’ earnings forecasts asherding or bold and finds that (1) boldness likelihood increases with the analyst’s prior accuracy, brokerage size, and experience and declines with the number of industries the analyst follows, consistent with theory linking boldness with career concerns and ability; (2) bold forecasts are more accurate than herding forecasts; and (3) herding forecast revisions are more strongly associated with analysts’ earnings forecast errors (actual earnings—forecast) than are bold forecast revisions. Thus, bold forecasts incorporate analysts’ private information more completely and provide more relevant information to investors than herding forecasts. THE Association Between Security Returns and analysts’ forecast revisions sug- gests that investors extract relevant information about upcoming earnings from analyst forecasts. However, herding can reduce the information conveyed by in- dividual analysts’ forecasts if analysts do not fully use their private information when revising their forecasts or else revise their forecasts simply to be closer to the mean forecast and not because of new private information. The purpose of this study is to assess the causes and consequences of herding by analysts and to provide evidence that can help market participants better evaluate the information in analysts’ earnings forecasts.

    "abstract": "We analyze the hedging decisions of firms, within an equilibrium setting that allows us to examine how a firm’s hedging choice depends on the hedging choices of its com- petitors. Within this equilibrium some firms hedge while others do not, even though all firms are ex ante identical. The fraction of firms that hedge depends on industry characteristics, such as the number of firms in the industry, the elasticity of demand, and the convexity of production costs. Consistent with prior empirical findings, the model predicts that there is more heterogeneity in the decision to hedge in the most competitive industries. Risks Have Costs AS Well as benefits. The costs have been the focus of a growing literature on corporate risk management and hence are well understood. 1 In contrast, the idea that risk can also be beneficial has been recognized in the real options literature but has largely been ignored in the risk management literature. The objective of this paper is to analyze the hedging decisions of firms that take into account both the costs and the benefits of their risk exposures. To do so we develop a model in the spirit of Froot, Scharfstein, and Stein (1993) (henceforth, FSS). FSS assume that internal funds are less costly than external funds. Consistent with this view, we consider the extreme case in which firms must rely solely on internal funds to finance their investments. In contrast to FSS, however, we model a firm’s output decision explicitly. In particular, we ass",

    "abstract": "Building on a model of corporate investment under collateral constraints, we develop and test a hypothesis on the differential effect of debt capacity on stock returns across financially constrained and unconstrained firms. Consistent with the hypothesis, we find that debt capacity is a significant determinant of stock returns only in the cross- section of financially constrained firms, after controlling for beta, size, book-to-market, leverage, and momentum. The findings suggest that cross-sectional differences in cor- porate investment behavior arising from financial constraints, predicted by theories of imperfect capital markets and supported by empirical evidence, are reflected in the stock returns of manufacturing firms. THE Impact OF Asymmetric information and agency problems on corporate in- vestment behavior has been the subject of extensive theoretical and empirical show how external finance in the equity market can be costly when there ex- ists an adverse selection problem of the sort analyzed by Akerlof (1970). Jaffee and Russell (1976) and Stiglitz and Weiss (1981) show that such an adverse selection problem can also lead to costly external finance in the debt market. These models of imperfections in capital markets imply that uncollateralized external financing is more costly than internal financing for those firms facing high information costs or severe incentive problems.

    "abstract": "We present evidence that restrictions to the set of feasible ﬁnancial contracts affect buyer-supplier relationships and the organizational form of the ﬁrm. We exploit a reg- ulation that restricted the maturity of the trade credit contracts that a large retailer could sign with some of its small suppliers. Using a within-product difference-in- differences identiﬁcation strategy, we ﬁnd that the restriction reduces the likelihood of trade by 11%. The retailer also responds by internalizing procurement to its own subsidiaries and reducing overall purchases. Finally, we ﬁnd that relational contracts can mitigate the inability to extend long trade credit terms. A Rich Literature IN ORGANIZATIONALeconomics studies how the institutional environment affects the boundary of the ﬁrm and the scope for trade with external parties (e.g., Coase (1937), Williamson (1973), Grossman and Hart (1986)). In particular, when contracts are not feasible or enforceable, vertical integration, that is, expansion in the vertical boundary of the ﬁrm, may replace arm’s length transactions with suppliers.

    "title": "Financial Development and Intersectoral",
    "abstract": "This paper uses a new methodology based on industry comovement to examine the role of financial market development in intersectoral allocation. Based on the assumption that there exist common global shocks to growth opportunities, we hypothesize that country pairs should have correlated patterns of sectoral growth if they are able to respond to these shocks. Consistent with financial markets promoting responsiveness to shocks, countries have more highly correlated growth rates across sectors when both countries have well-developed financial markets. This effect is stronger between country pairs at similar levels of economic development, which are more likely to experience similar growth shocks. Economists Have Long Claimed that financial market institutions perform an im- portant function in the development process, particularly through their role in allocating resources to their most productive uses. This allocative role of finan- cial institutions was recognized first by Schumpeter (1912), who conjectured that bankers help to identify entrepreneurs with good growth prospects, and therefore help to reallocate resources to their most productive uses. If this is the case, then well-developed financial institutions are crucial to an efficient allo- cation of resources in response to shocks to growth opportunities. In light of this proposed function, a test of the role of financial development in the allocation of resources would involve examining whether financial development h",

    "abstract": "In countries with more secure property rights, firms might allocate resources better and consequentially grow faster as the returns on different types of as- sets are more protected against competitors' actions. Using data on sectoral value added for a large number of countries, we find evidence consistent with better property rights leading to higher growth through improved asset allo- cation. Quantitatively, the growth effect is as large as that of improved access to financing due to greater financial development. Our results are robust using various samples and specifications, including controlling for growth opportunities. Recently, numerous papers have established that financial development fosters growth and that a country's financial development is related to its institutional characteristics, including its legal framework. The financial development and growth literature has established that finance matters for growth both at the macroeconomic and microeconomic level (King and Levine (1993), Levine (1997)). The law and finance literature has found that financial markets are better devel- oped in countries with strong legal frameworks (La Porta et al. (1998), Beck, Demir- gíiç-Kunt, and Levine (2003)). These well-developed financial markets make it easier for firms to attract financing for their investment needs (Demirgûç-Kunt and Maksimovic (1998), Rajan and Zingales (1998)).

    "abstract": "We use a unique data set of bank loans to examine the wealth effects on lead lending banks when their borrowers suffer financial distress. We find a significant negative announcement return for the lead lending bank when a major corporate borrower announces default or bankruptcy. Banks with high- er exposure to the distressed firm have larger negative announcement-period returns. The existence of a past lending relationship with the distressed firm results in larger wealth declines for the bank shareholders. Finally, financial distress also has a significant negative effect on borrower's returns. Recent Banking Literature has focused increased attention on the costs and ben- efits of banking relationships (see Boot (2000)). In particular, existing empirical work has been aimed primarily at establishing and estimating the value of the relationships that borrowers have established with their bankers. Leading exam- ples include James (1987; excess returns to borrowers on the announcement of new bank loans), Peterson and Rajan (1994; the role of the length of a relationship in determining the availability and pricing of bank credit), Puri (1996) and Gande et al. (1997; better pricing of newly issued securities when the underwriter also has a lending relationship). More recently, Dahiya et al.

    "abstract": "We explicitly consider ﬁnancial leverage in a simple equity valuation model and study the cross-sectional implications of potential shareholder recovery upon resolu- tion of ﬁnancial distress. Our model is capable of simultaneously explaining lower returns for ﬁnancially distressed stocks, stronger book-to-market effects for ﬁrms with high default likelihood, and the concentration of momentum proﬁts among low credit quality ﬁrms. The model further predicts (i) a hump-shaped relationship be- tween value premium and default probability, and (ii) stronger momentum proﬁts for nearly distressed ﬁrms with signiﬁcant prospects for shareholder recovery. Our empirical analysis strongly conﬁrms these novel predictions. Financial Distress IS Frequently Invoked to justify the existence of “anoma- lous” cross-sectional properties of equity returns such as the size effect and the value premium (e.g., Fama and French (1996)).

    "abstract": "We show that ﬁrms intermediating trade have incentives to overinvest in ﬁnancial expertise. In our model, expertise improves ﬁrms’ ability to estimate value when trading a security. Expertise creates asymmetric information, which, under normal circumstances, works to the advantage of the expert as it deters opportunistic bar- gaining by counterparties. This advantage is neutralized in equilibrium, however, by offsetting investments by competitors. Moreover, when volatility rises the adverse selection created by expertise triggers breakdowns in liquidity, destroying gains to trade and thus the beneﬁts that ﬁrms hope to gain through high levels of expertise. THE Financial Sector Attracts extremely qualiﬁed workers. Philippon and Reshef (2010)document that, when compared to other sectors of the economy, the growth in ﬁnancial services in recent decades has been associated with in- creases in employees’ academic education, task complexity, and compensation. This investment in ﬁnancial expertise no doubt facilitates a range of important and productive roles that ﬁnancial intermediaries serve in modern economies. These include improving risk sharing and risk management, overcoming fric- tions that interfere with efﬁcient trade, and engineering securities that allow new clienteles to access capital markets. Our paper points to incentives ﬁnancial ﬁrms have tooverinvest in ﬁnancial expertise and suggests that these investments can have a destabilizing effect on ﬁnancial markets. We d",

    "title": "Financial Flexibility, Bank Capital Flows,",
    "abstract": "In our parsimonious general-equilibrium model of banking and asset pricing, inter- mediaries have the expertise to monitor and reallocate capital. We study ﬁnancial development, intraeconomy capital ﬂows, the size of the banking sector, the value of intermediation, expected market returns, and the risk of bank crashes. Asset pricing implications include: a market’s dividend yield is related to its ﬁnancial ﬂexibility, and capital ﬂows should be important in explaining expected returns and the risk of bank crashes. Our predictions are broadly consistent with the aggregate behavior of U.S. Capital markets since 1950. WHY IS A Well-developed ﬁnancial sector important and what effect does it have on the risk in an economy? According to the development literature, ﬁ- nancial development leads to economic growth because it allows intermediaries to carry out tasks such as reducing investment costs or pooling capital more efﬁciently.1 However, in this view of ﬁnancial development there is no chan- nel for intermediaries to either avert or create systemic risk. By contrast, in the banking literature, the fundamental role of intermediaries is to transform risk. Speciﬁcally, intermediaries have the expertise to reallocate investment capital, and so they provide a link between capital owners and entrepreneurs, allowing both to achieve the optimal mix of risk and returns. Intermediaries also have the expertise to change the risk of existing investments by monitor- ing. From the perspectiv",

    "title": "Financial Fragility with SAM?",
    "abstract": "Shared appreciation mortgages (SAMs) feature mortgage payments that adjust with house prices. They are designed to stave off borrower default by providing payment relief when house prices fall. Some argue that SAMs may help prevent the next foreclosure crisis. However, home owners’ gains from payment relief are mortgage lenders’ losses. A general equilibrium model in which ﬁnancial intermediaries chan- nel savings from saver to borrower households shows that indexation of mortgage payments to aggregate house prices increases ﬁnancial fragility, reduces risk-sharing, and leads to expensive ﬁnancial sector bailouts. In contrast, indexation to local house prices reduces ﬁnancial fragility and improves risk-sharing.

    "abstract": "Financial intermediaries trade frequently in many markets using sophisticated mod- els. Their marginal value of wealth should therefore provide a more informative stochastic discount factor (SDF) than that of a representative consumer. Guided by theory, we use shocks to the leverage of securities broker-dealers to construct an intermediary SDF. Intuitively, deteriorating funding conditions are associated with deleveraging and high marginal value of wealth. Our single-factor model prices size, book-to-market, momentum, and bond portfolios with an R2 of 77% and an average annual pricing error of 1%—performing as well as standard multifactor benchmarks designed to price these assets. Modern Finance Theory asserts that asset prices are determined by their co- variances with the stochastic discount factor (SDF), which is usually linked to the marginal value of aggregate wealth. Assets that are expected to pay off in future states with high marginal value of wealth are worth more today, as dictated by investors’ ﬁrst-order conditions. Following this theory, much of the empirical asset pricing literature centers on measuring the marginal value of wealth of a representative investor, typically the average household. Speciﬁ- cally, the SDF is represented by the marginal value of wealth aggregated over all households. However, the logic that leads to this SDF relies on strong as- sumptions: all households must participate in all markets, there cannot be transactions costs, households h",

    "abstract": "We match administrative panel data on portfolio choices with survey measures of ﬁnancial literacy. When we control for portfolio risk, the most literate households experience 0.4% higher annual returns than the least literate households. Distinct portfolio dynamics are the key determinant of this difference. More literate house- holds hold riskier positions when expected returns are higher, they more actively rebalance their portfolios and do so in a way that holds their risk exposure relatively constant over time, and they are more likely to buy assets that provide higher returns than the assets that they sell. IT IS Well Established That households exhibit substantial heterogeneity in both the performance of their portfolios (Campbell (2006), Calvet, Camp- bell, and Sodini (2007)) and their understanding of basic ﬁnancial principles (Lusardi and Mitchell (2011)). Recent evidence also suggests a precise rela- tionship between these two facts: households experiencing lower risk-adjusted returns tend to be less literate (Von Gaudecker (2015)).1 The mechanisms underlying the relationship between ﬁnancial literacy and returns, however, are much less understood. Part of the challenge is empirical. It is difﬁcult to ﬁnd data that combine detailed information on household port- folios with measures of household sophistication. Administrative data typically lack direct measures of ﬁnancial sophistication, and survey data typically lack the details and panel structure necessary to ex",

    "abstract": "We assemble the announcement and actual introduction dates of electronic trading by the leading exchanges of 120 countries to examine the impact of automation, con- trolling for risk factors and economic conditions. Dividend growth models and inter- national Capm suggest a significant decline in the equity premium, especially in emerging markets. Consistent with this reduction in the equity premium in the long run, there is a positive short-term price reaction to the switch. Further analysis of trading turnover supports the notion that electronic trading enhances the liquidity and informativeness of stock markets, leading to a reduction in the cost of capital. Rapid Technological Advancements IN Telecommunications and the Internet are transforming the basic business model of a stock exchange. In an increasingly competitive world with low barriers to entry, exchange owners are rapidly rec- ognizing that efficient market design and trading mechanisms are crucial to winning greater market share, in terms of both trading volume and number of listings. Accordingly, scores of stock exchanges around the world have intro- duced fully automated and transparent electronic trading systems, replacing their trading floors on which brokers manually match orders using an open- outcry system. 1 This paper empirically examines whether this major change in market microstructure has helped the listed firms lower their cost of equity because of improvements in liquidity and the informational env",

    "abstract": "We model a ﬁnancial market where some traders of a risky asset do not fully appreci- ate what prices convey about others’ private information. Markets comprising solely such “cursed” traders generate more trade than those comprising solely rationals. Be- cause rationals arbitrage away distortions caused by cursed traders, mixed markets can generate even more trade. Per-trader volume in cursed markets increases with from prices, even when they dismiss it as noisier than their own. Making private in- formation public raises rational and “dismissive” volume, but reduces cursed volume given moderate noninformational trading motives. Ever Since Milgrom AND Stokey (1982) and Tirole (1982), researchers have understood that common knowledge of rationality combined with a common prior precludes purely speculative trade. Of course, people might rationally trade ﬁnancial assets for a variety of nonspeculative motives, such as portfolio rebalancing and liquidity. Yet even in settings where the presence of nonspec- ulative motives allows for speculative trade, a rational understanding of the adverse selection problem causes the overall volume of trade to be constrained by nonspeculative motives. In many people’s estimation, trading volume in ﬁ- nancial markets greatly exceeds what can be plausibly explained by models applying rational expectations equilibrium (REE).1 beris; Bruno Biais (the Editor); John Campbell; Kent Daniel; Willie Fuchs; Xavier Gabaix; Tristan Gagnon-Bartsch; Josh Schw",

My analysis, which em- phasizes differences between shocks to debt and equity markets, provides insights about some stylized facts from the macro ﬁnance literature.

IN THE Aftermath OFthe 2008 ﬁnancial crisis, ﬁnancial economists have shown an increased interest in public policy. This is a sign that our ﬁeld has matured. Our models now have sufﬁcient realism and clarity to not only help us un- derstand what is happening in the real world, but also provide insights about potential policy choices.

Themutual learning between ﬁnancial markets and the real economy creates a strategic complementarity in their information production, leading to self-fulﬁlling surges in economic uncertainties. In a dynamic setting, our model characterizes self-fulﬁlling uncertainty traps with two steady-state equilibria and a two-stage economic crisis in transitional dynamics. Uncertainty IN Both Financial Markets and the real economy rises sharply during recessions. The recent ﬁnancial crisis of 2007 to 2009 presented one of the most striking episodes of such heightened uncertainty. Financial market uncertainty, measured by the VIX index, jumped by an astonishing 313% in the Great Recession. The increase in measured real economic uncertainty was equally astounding. For instance, macroeconomic uncertainty measured in Ju- rado, Ludvigson, and Ng (2015) almost doubled, and Bloom et al. (2012) report a 152% increase in micro-level real uncertainty as measured by the ﬁrm-level dispersion of output. What causes such sudden spikes in uncertainty? Why do ﬁnancial uncertainty and real uncertainty move together? And why do they rise sharply in recessions?

    "abstract": "I develop a model of financial networks in which linkages not only spread contagion, but also induce private sector bailouts, where liquid banks bail out illiquid banks because of the threat of contagion. Introducing this bailout possibility, I show that linkages may be optimal ex ante because they allow banks to obtain some mutual insurance even though formal commitments are impossible. However, in some cases (e.g., when liquidity is concentrated among a small group of banks), the whole network may collapse. I also characterize the optimal network size and apply the results to joint liability arrangements and payment systems. Linkages Among Agents IN Financial Markets are a concern because of the risk of financial contagion, that is, the risk that a small shock to one agent will spread to other agents in a domino effect. Whether we should worry about these linkages is an open question. The main goal of this paper is to show that a network in which agents are closely interlinked may be optimal both because of and despite the potential for contagion. Another goal is to characterize optimal networks, that is, whether and how agents should be linked to one another. The basic intuition is as follows: Linkages present the threat of contagion. To prevent collapse of the whole network, agents who are lucky ex post may be willing to “bail out” those who are not. In this way, agents obtain the benefits of mutual insurance even though they cannot precommit to making payments. Linkages,",

We use a bank-level panel data set spanning all U.K.-resident banks between 1997Q3 and 2010Q1. After nationalization, foreign banks reduced their frac- tion of British loans by about 11% and increased their effective interest rates by about 70 basis points. In contrast, nationalized British banks did not signiﬁcantly change either their loan mix or effective interest rates. “We will not retreat into ﬁnancial protectionism.” — G20 Leaders’ Statement from London Summit, April 2009, and — G20 Leaders’ Statement from Pittsburgh Summit, September 2009 “We reafﬁrm our commitment to avoid ﬁnancial protectionism.” — G20 Leaders’ Statement from Seoul Summit, November 2010 The “Great Recession” that engulfed the world in 2008 to 2009 is frequently compared to the Great Depression of the early 1930s.

Furthermore, they have lower savings rates, fewer liquid savings, and higher debt-to-income ratios, leav- ing them more exposed to income shocks. Robustness tests, supported by anecdotal survey evidence, indicate that these results are driven by some consumers’ lack of ﬁ- nancial sophistication and their consequent failure to understand their ﬁnancial con- tracts, rather than by random idiosyncratic shocks, rational liquidity management, or optimal inattention.

    "abstract": "We develop an equilibrium model of learning by rational traders to reconcile sev- eral empirical regularities: Cross sectionally, most individual speculators lose money; large speculators outperform small speculators; past performance positively affects subsequent trade intensity; most new traders lose money and cease speculation; and performance shows persistence. Learning from trading generates substantial endoge- nous liquidity, reducing bid–ask spreads and the impact of exogenous liquidity shocks on asset prices, but amplifying the effects of real shocks. Introducing slightly over- confident traders increases bid–ask spreads, hurting all traders. Finally, behavioral theories cannot reconcile all of these empirical regularities. While Individual Speculators IN Financial Markets account for a large share of total market activity, studies of different financial markets and time periods find that most speculators realize net trading losses (see Steward (1949), Ross (1973, 1975), Hieronymus (1977), and Barber et al. (2004)). Thus, a natural question to ask is: Why do investors engage in such apparent wealth-destructive activities? A number of researchers address this question using behavioral- and psychological-based explanations. For instance, Hieronymus (1977), Teweles and Jones (1987), and Hartzmark (1991) propose risk-loving, or utility from gambling. However, Barber et al.

    "abstract": "This paper shows that large cash reserves lead to systematic future market share gains at the expense of industry rivals. Using shifts in import tariffs to identify ex- ogenous intensiﬁcation of competition, difference-in-difference estimations support the causal impact of cash on product market performance. Moreover, the analysis reveals that the “competitive” effect of cash is markedly distinct from the strategic effect of debt on product market outcomes. This effect is stronger when rivals face tighter ﬁnancing constraints and when the number of interactions between competi- tors is large. Overall, the results suggest that cash policy encompasses a substantial strategic dimension. Seldom HAS Corporate strategy been turned on its head so quickly. Not long ago, cash holdings were considered a dangerous thing to accumulate and com- panies that hoarded large cash positions were viewed with a great deal of suspicion.1 However, the recent market turmoil and the resultant tightening of credit have clearly emphasized the advantage of maintaining a liquid bal- ance sheet, as many ﬁrms are desperately seeking to avoid a cash squeeze.2 This rapidly changing perspective underscores the need for a deeper under- standing of what the implications of corporate cash policy really are.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the relation between ﬁrms’ locations and their corporate ﬁnance decisions. We develop a model where being located within an industry cluster increases opportunities to make acquisitions, and to facilitate those acquisitions, ﬁrms within clusters maintain more ﬁnancial slack. Consistent with our model we ﬁnd that ﬁrms located within industry clusters make more acquisitions, and have lower debt ratios and larger cash balances than their industry peers located outside clusters. We also document that ﬁrms in high-tech cities and growing cities maintain more ﬁnancial slack. Overall, the evidence suggests that growth opportunities inﬂuence ﬁrms’ ﬁnancial decisions. IN 1992, THE Apache Corporation, then a small oil and gas ﬁrm located in Denver (CO), acquired MW Petroleum, a subsidiary of Amoco Corporation, a major integrated oil company. This acquisition, which more than doubled the size of its oil and gas reserves, was viewed by Apache’s top management as a major success, and to a large extent deﬁned Apache’s future strategy: to grow by acquiring mature oil and gas ﬁelds from the major integrated oil ﬁrms. To implement this strategy Apache moved from Denver to Houston (TX), where most of the major oil ﬁrms had operations, and reduced its debt ratio to im- prove its credit rating. By locating in Houston, Apache’s management believed that they would have better access to and knowledge about potential deals. Maintaining an investment grade bond rating (Apache",

We con- sider activities with nonsynergistic operational cash flows, and examine the purely financial benefits of separation versus merger. The magnitude of financial synergies depends upon tax rates, default costs, relative size, and the riskiness and correlation of cash flows. Contrary to accepted wisdom, financial synergies from mergers can be negative if firms have quite different risks or default costs. The results provide a rationale for structured finance techniques such as asset securitization and project finance. Decisions That Alter THE SCOPEof the firm are among the most important faced by management, and among the most studied by academics. Mergers and spinoffs are classic examples of such decisions. More recently, structured finance has seen explosive growth: Asset securitization exceeded $6.8 trillion in 2004, and Esty and Christov (2002) report that in 2001, more than half of capital invest- ments with costs exceeding $500 million were financed on a separate project basis. 1 Yetf inancial theory has made little headway in explaining structured finance.

Instead, our results are in line with the hypothesis that a lower trading volume reduces liquidity and in turn market quality. Consistent with theories of asset pricing under transaction costs, we document a shift in security holdings from short-term to long-term investors. Finally, we ﬁnd that moderate aggregate effects on market quality can mask large adjustments made by individual agents. THE Global Financial CRISIShas renewed interest in ﬁnancial transaction taxes (FTTs), a development that has been fueled by the combination of strapped pub- lic ﬁnances and public discontent with the ﬁnancial industry.1 Since suggested ∗Jean-Edouard Colliard is at HEC Paris.

    "title": "Financial and Legal Constraints to Growth:",
    "abstract": "Using a unique firm-level survey database covering 54 countries, we investigate the effect of financial, legal, and corruption problems on firms’ growth rates. Whether these factors constrain growth depends on firm size. It is consistently the smallest firms that are most constrained. Financial and institutional development weakens the constraining effects of financial, legal, and corruption obstacles and it is again the small firms that benefit the most. There is only a weak relation between firms’ perception of the quality of the courts in their country and firm growth. We also provide evidence that the corruption of bank officials constrains firm growth. Corporate Finance Theory Suggests that market imperfections, such as those caused by underdeveloped financial and legal systems, constrain firms’ ability to fund investment projects. Using firm-level data, Demirg¨uc ¸-Kunt and Maksi- movic (1998) show that firms in countries with developed financial institutions and efficient legal systems obtain more external financing than firms in coun- tries with less-developed institutions. Although these findings show a strong effect of financial institutions and the legal system on firm growth, their con- clusions are based on a sample of the largest firms in each of the economies they study. Their study relies on inferring firms’ demand for external financing from a financial model of the firm. In this paper, we use a size-stratified survey of over 4,000 firms in 54 coun- tries to",

    "title": "Financially Constrained Stock Returns",
    "abstract": "We study the effect of financial constraints on risk and expected returns by extend- ing the investment-based asset pricing framework to incorporate retained earnings, debt, costly equity, and collateral constraints on debt capacity. Quantitative results show that more financially constrained firms are riskier and earn higher expected stock returns than less financially constrained firms. Intuitively, by preventing firms from financing all desired investments, collateral constraints restrict the flexibility of firms in smoothing dividend streams in the face of aggregate shocks. The inflexibility mechanism also gives rise to a convex relation between market leverage and expected stock returns. A Voluminous Literature in corporate finance and macroeconomics has studied in depth the impact of financial constraints on firm value, capital investment, and business cycles. 1 In asset pricing, an important open question is how fi- nancial constraints affect risk and expected returns. Using the Kaplan and Zingales (1997) index of financial constraints, Lamont, Polk, and Sa ´a-Requejo (2001) report that more constrained firms earn lower average returns than less constrained firms. However, Whited and Wu (2006) use an alternative index and find that more constrained firms earn higher average returns than less constrained firms, although the difference is insignificant. Conflicting evidence is difficult to interpret without models that explicitly tie the characteristics in question with",

    "abstract": "We present evidence that ﬁnancing frictions adversely impact investment in work- place safety, with implications for worker welfare and ﬁrm value. Using several iden- tiﬁcation strategies, we ﬁnd that injury rates increase with leverage and negative cash ﬂow shocks, and decrease with positive cash ﬂow shocks. We show that ﬁrm value decreases substantially with injury rates. Our ﬁndings suggest that invest- ment in worker safety is an economically important margin on which ﬁrms respond to ﬁnancing constraints. Over 3.5 Million Workplace INJURIESand illnesses occur in the United States each year. The estimated annual cost of these injuries is $250 billion, more than the cost of all forms of cancer combined (Leigh (2001)). While workplace safety has been studied extensively in ﬁelds as diverse as industrial relations, operations management, and industrial-organizational psychology, its connec- tions with ﬁnance remain largely unexplored. This paper studies how ﬁnancing constraints impact workplace safety, which has implications for ﬁrm value and employee welfare. Firms invest resources in improving workplace safety just as they invest tional capital. As with other forms of investment, spending on safety must be ﬁnanced out of either internal cash ﬂow or externally raised capital. In a world with ﬁnancing frictions, a ﬁrm’s investment may be sensitive to the ﬁnancial resources available to ﬁnance that investment. Thus, the safety of a ﬁrm’s workplaces could depend on the ﬁnancial",

    "abstract": "The financing of R&D provides a potentially important channel to link finance and economic growth, but there is no direct evidence that financial effects are large enough to impact aggregate R&D. U.S. Firms finance R&D from volatile sources: cash flow and stock issues. We estimate dynamic R&D models for high-tech firms and find significant effects of cash flow and external equity for young, but not mature, firms. The financial coefficients for young firms are large enough that finance supply shifts can explain most of the dramatic 1990s R&D boom, which implies a significant connection between finance, innovation, and growth. Does Finance Cause Growth ? A large empirical literature, surveyed by Levine (2005), establishes a strong connection between broad measures of financial de- velopment and economic growth. Questions remain, however, about the chan- nels through which finance may matter for growth. One potentially important channel is the financing of R&D, a critical input to innovation and growth in modern economies. R&D is particularly interesting not only because of the knowledge spillovers it creates—a major feature of endogenous growth models—but also because R&D may be difficult to finance with external sources (e.g., Arrow (1962)). 1 While a small number of empirical studies suggest that some firms face financing constraints for R&D (see Hall (2002)), there is no direct microevidence that these financial effects are large enough to matter for aggregate R&D.

    "title": "Financing Policy, Basis Risk, and Corporate",
    "abstract": "This paper studies the hedging policies of oil and gas producers between 1992 and 1994. My evidence shows that the extent of hedging is related to financing costs: In particular, companies with greater financial leverage manage price risks more extensively. My evidence also shows that the likelihood of hedging is related to economies of scale in hedging costs and to the basis risk associated with hedging instruments. Larger companies and companies whose production is located primar- ily in regions where prices have a high correlation with the prices on which exchange- traded derivatives are based are more likely to manage risks. Despite THE Prevalence OF Corporate Risk Management and the effort that has been devoted to developing theoretical rationales for hedging, there are no widely accepted explanations for risk management as a corporate policy. Im- portant questions remain regarding the determinants of the extent to which a company hedges, the impact of risk management on a firm's value, and the interaction between a firm's hedging policy and its other policy decisions. To address some of these questions, I examine the risk management activities of 100 oil and gas producers for 1992 to 1994. In particular, I investigate whether the fraction of production an oil and gas producer hedges against price fluctuations is related to its financing policy, tax status, compensation policy, ownership structure, and operating characteristics.

    "title": "Financing and Advising: Optimal Financial",
    "abstract": "This paper analyses the joint provision of effort by an entrepreneur and by an advisor to improve the productivity of an investment project. Without moral hazard, it is optimal that both exert effort. With moral hazard, if the entrepre- neur's effort is more efficient (less costly) than the advisor's effort, the latter is not hired if she does not provide funds. Outside financing arises endogenously. This explains why investors like venture capitalists are value enhancing. The level of outside financing determines whether common stocks or convertible bonds should be issued in response to incentives. THE Venture Capital Industry has grown dramatically over the last decade. In the United States, venture capital (hereafterVC) investments grew from $3.3 billion in 1990 to $100 billion in 2000. In Europe, funds invested in VC grew from $6.4 billion in 1998 to more than $10 billion in 1999. The success of VC is largely due to the active involvement of the venture capitalists. These so-called hands-on in- vestors carefully select the investment projects they are proposed (Sahlman (1988, 1990)) and remain deeply involved in those projects after investment is rea- lized. Their most recognized roles include the extraction of information on the quality of the projects (Gompers (1995)), the monitoring of the firms (Lerner (1995), Hellmann and Puri (2002)), and also the provision of managerial advice to entrepreneurs. This advising role has been extensively documented empiri- cally by Gor",

    "abstract": "Unlike traditional ﬁrm production, gig economy workers provide their own physi- cal capital. As a consequence, the low-income households for whom gig economy opportunities are most valuable often borrow to participate. In the context of ride share, difference-in-difference analysis reveals increased vehicle purchases, borrow- ing, utilization, and employment around entry, but ﬁnancially constrained individ- uals cannot participate. To assess the equilibrium importance of ﬁnancing, I build and estimate a structural model of the gig economy. Access to ﬁnance proves critical for the gig economy’s growth: without ﬁnance, equilibrium quantities would be 40% lower and prices 90% higher, and only higher-income households could participate as drivers. Firms Like Uber ,L YFT, AND Airbnb have created convenient markets for households to sell capital services with their durable consumption goods. Car owners can provide rides, and homeowners can house guests in their spare rooms. As these technologies have spread, individuals have joined the so-called gig economy in droves as drivers, delivery people, and hosts. As of 2019, Uber estimates that roughly 3 million Uber drivers accounted for roughly $30 billion in North American gross bookings. Airbnb hosts listed more than 7 million va- cancies.1 While there has been intense debate about the role of technology and regulatory arbitrage in the gig economy’s growth, this paper focuses on a key distinguishing characteristic of gig economy ﬁrms.",

    "title": "Fire Sales in a Model of Complexity",
    "abstract": "We present a model of ﬁnancial crises that stem from endogenous complexity.W e conceptualize complexity as banks’ uncertainty about the ﬁnancial network of cross exposures. As conditions deteriorate, cross exposures generate the possibility of a domino effect of bankruptcies. As this happens, banks face an increasingly complex environment since they need to understand a greater fraction of the ﬁnancial network to assess their own ﬁnancial health. Complexity dramatically ampliﬁes banks’ per- ceived counterparty risk, and makes relatively healthy banks reluctant to buy risky assets. The model also features a novel complexity externality. ONE OF THE Most damaging aspects of ﬁnancial crises is the enormous uncer- tainty they generate, and a central factor behind this uncertainty is the com- plexity of the linkages among modern ﬁnancial institutions (banks, for short). The concern for the uncertainty and complexity combination, and the perverse ﬁre sales that accompany it, inﬂuences private and public choices alike. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, in his testimony to the Senate on April 3, 2008 following the Fed’s Bear Stearns intervention, captures this concern as follows: Our ﬁnancial system is extremely complex and interconnected, and Bear Stearns participated extensively in a range of critical markets. The sud- den failure of Bear Stearns likely would have led to a chaotic unwinding of positions in those markets and could have severely shaken conﬁdence. The company’s fa",

    "abstract": "We identify and track over time the factors that make the ﬁnancial system vulnerable to ﬁre sales by constructing an index of aggregate vulnerability . The index starts in- creasing quickly in 2004, before most other major systemic risk measures, and triples by 2008. The ﬁre-sale-speciﬁc factors of delevering speed and concentration of illiq- uid assets account for the majority of this increase. Individual banks’ contributions to aggregate vulnerability predict other ﬁrm-speciﬁc measures of systemic risk, includ- ing Srisk and/Delta1CoVaR. The balance-sheet-based measures we propose are therefore useful early indicators of when and where vulnerabilities are building up. Fire -sale Spillovers Have Long been recognized as a potentially impor- tant source of contagion in ﬁnancial markets and therefore are a systemic risk concern.1 The mechanisms, systemic implications, and welfare costs of ﬁre sales have been abundantly studied in the theoretical literature.2 The em- pirical literature, in contrast, is thinner, as it is difﬁcult to conclusively iden- tify ﬁre sales.

    "abstract": "Fire sales induced by investor redemptions have powerful spillover effects among funds that hold the same assets, hurting peer funds’ performance and ﬂows, and lead- ing to further asset sales with negative bond price impact. A one-standard-deviation increase in our ﬁre-sale spillover measure leads to a 45 (90) bp decrease in peer fund returns (ﬂows) and a two percentage point increase in the likelihood of a large bond price drop. The results hold in a regression-discontinuity design addressing iden- tiﬁcation concerns. Timing, heterogeneity, instrumental-variable, and placebo tests further support the price-impact mechanism. Model-based counterfactual and stress- test analyses quantify the ﬁnancial stability implications. Starting With THE Influential Work of Shleifer and Vishny ( 1992), a major topic in ﬁnance is that basic equilibrium considerations may compound the cost of ﬁnancial distress, thus aggravating the fragility of the ﬁnancial system. Broadly, the idea is that distressed asset sales are particularly costly in circumstances when the pool of potential buyers of a specialized or illiquid asset is equally likely to be ﬁnancially constrained and therefore unable to supply liquidity. More speciﬁcally, as Coval and Stafford ( 2007) note, “the cycle whereby capital ﬂows can force widespread trading in individual securities, re- sulting in institutional price pressure, which in turn affects fund performance and eventually feeds back into capital ﬂows, is intriguing” (p.",

I also document that, following the adoption of these laws, a firm’s degree of operating leverage rises, earnings variability increases, and employment becomes more rigid.

    "abstract": "New ﬁrms are an important source of job creation, but the underlying economic mechanisms for why this is so are not well understood. Using an identiﬁcation strategy that links shocks to local income to job creation in the nontradable sector, we ask whether job creation arises more through new ﬁrm creation or through the expansion of existing ﬁrms. We ﬁnd that new ﬁrms account for the bulk of net employment creation in response to local investment opportunities. We also ﬁnd signiﬁcant gross job creation and destruction by existing ﬁrms, suggesting that positive local shocks accelerate churn. Startups Create THE Majority of new jobs in the American economy (Haltiwanger, Jarmin, and Miranda (2013)), and job creation at young ﬁrms exhibits strong comovement with business cycles.1 However, the precise eco- nomic mechanisms underlying the central role that startups play in the job creation process are not well understood. Identifying and understanding these mechanisms is important, especially in light of recent evidence on the struc- tural shifts in employment from young to mature ﬁrms and the reduction in the dynamism of the U.S. Economy.2 To better understand the mechanisms that connect startups to aggregate job creation, and to understand how the economy creates jobs in response to shocks, it is ﬁrst important to look past the ﬁrmsize distribution and instead focus on comparisons based on ﬁrmage.

    "abstract": "This paper develops a top-down model of capital budgeting in which privately in- formed executives make investment choices that convey information to the ﬁrm’s stakeholders (e.g., employees). Favorable information in this setting encourages stakeholders to take actions that positively contribute to the ﬁrm’s success (e.g., employees work harder). Within this framework we examine how ﬁrms may distort their investment choices to inﬂuence the information conveyed to stakeholders and show that investment rigidities and overinvestment can arise as optimal investment distortions. We also examine investment distortions in multi-divisional ﬁrms and compare such distortions to those in single-division ﬁrms. This Paper Develops Atop-down model of capital allocation in which privately informed executives make investment choices that convey information to the ﬁrm’s stakeholders. The information conveyed by the executives’ investment choices is relevant because it inﬂuences the actions of the stakeholders, which in turn affect the likelihood of the ﬁrm’s success. Speciﬁcally, since higher in- vestment expenditures are associated with better ﬁrm prospects, stakeholders, who receive a share of the output, are willing to expend more effort to improve the probability that the ﬁrm will be successful. Within this setting, we examine the optimal design of capital allocation mechanisms. We show that the process used to make investment choices affects how the information conveyed by in- vestment c",

    "title": "Firm Performance Pay as Insurance against",
    "abstract": "The prevalence of pay based on risky ﬁrm outcomes for nonexecutive workers presents a puzzling departure from conventional contract theory , which predicts in- surance provision by the ﬁrm. When workers at the same ﬁrm compete against each other for promotions, the optimal contract features pay based on ﬁrm outcomes as insurance against promotion risk. The model’s predictions are consistent with many observed phenomena, such as performance-based vesting and overvaluation of eq- uity pay by nonexecutive workers. It also generates novel predictions linking a ﬁrm’s hierarchy to its workers’ pay structure. THE Moral Hazard Literature Suggests that ﬁrms should insure risk- averse workers against uncertain ﬁrm outcomes that are beyond their individ- ual control. Yet, nonexecutive workers in the United States routinely receive performance pay based on uncertain ﬁrm outcomes (Kruse, Blasi, and Park (2010)). As Bergman and Jenter (2007, p. 668) point out, the prevalence of such performance pay for nonexecutive workers “is a puzzle for standard eco- nomic theory: any positive incentive effects should be diminished by free-rider problems and overshadowed by the cost of imposing risk on employees.” This paper argues that when workers compete against each other for promotions, performance pay based on ﬁrm outcomes can insure against poor promotion itor, Wei Xiong, two anonymous referees, and an anonymous associate editor for their feedback, which tremendously improved the paper.

    "title": "Firm Size and Cyclical Variations",
    "abstract": "Recent imperfect capital market theories predict the presence of asymmetries in the variation of small and large firms' risk over the economic cycle. Small firms with little collateral should be more strongly affected by tighter credit market conditions in a recession state than large, better collateralized ones. This paper adopts a flexible econometric model to analyze these implications empirically. Con- sistent with theory, small firms display the highest degree of asymmetry in their risk across recession and expansion states, which translates into a higher sensi- tivity of their expected stock returns with respect to variables that measure credit market conditions. Recent Imperfect Capital Market Theories (e.g., Bernanke and Gertler (1989), Gertler and Gilchrist (1994), Kiyotaki and Moore (1997)) predict that chang- ing credit market conditions can have very different effects on small and large firms' risk. Agency costs induced by asymmetry in the information held by firms and their creditors make it necessary for firms to use collat- eral when borrowing in the credit markets. Small firms, it is argued, typi- cally do not have nearly as much collateral as large firms and will not have the same ability to raise external funds. Therefore, small firms will be more adversely affected by lower liquidity and higher short-term interest rates. Such theories do not simply have the cross-sectional implication that small firms' risk will be more strongly affected by tighter credit m",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the hedging activities of 119 U.S. Oil and gas producers from 1998 to 2001 and evaluates their effect on firm value. Theories of hedging based on market imperfections imply that hedging should increase the firm’s market value (MV). To test this hypothesis, we collect detailed information on the extent of hedging and on the valuation of oil and gas reserves. We verify that hedging reduces the firm’s stock price sensitivity to oil and gas prices. Contrary to previous studies, however, we find that hedging does not seem to affect MVs for this industry. IN A Classic Modigliani AND Miller (M&M) World with perfect capital markets, risk management should be irrelevant. When there are no information asym- metries, taxes, or transaction costs, hedging financial risk should not add value to the firm because shareholders can undo any risk management activities im- plemented by the firm at the same cost. In practice, imperfections in capital markets create a rationale for lowering the volatility of earnings through hedging. Conventional explanations relate to the cost of financial distress, tax incentives, and the underinvestment problem. Risk management may also add value if hedging positions in derivatives con- tracts carry a premium that is not commensurate with risk, or if active trading activities create a profit. Most empirical studies on this topic focus on the relation between corporate hedging and firm characteristics, and try to determine whether the behavior",

    "title": "First-Order Risk Aversion, Heterogeneity,",
    "abstract": "We examine a wide range of two-date economies populated by heterogeneous agents with the most common forms of nonexpected utility preferences used in finance and macroeconomics. We demonstrate that the risk premium and the risk-free rate in these models are sensitive to ignoring heterogeneity. This follows because of endogenous withdrawal by nonexpected utility agents from the market for the risky asset. This finding is important precisely because these alternative preferences have frequently been proposed as possible resolutions to various asset pricing puzzles, and they have all been examined exclusively in a representative agent framework. THE Well -documented shortcomings of asset pricing models based, in part, on the expected utility (EU) hypothesis has motivated a large and rapidly grow- ing set of pricing models that incorporate nonexpected utility preferences. The pricing implications of these models in the existing literature have been based exclusively on the assumption of a single representative agent (RA) who prices assets using the aggregate endowment as the consumption process. While ag- gregation is well understood in the standard EU setting (see Constantinides (1982)), it can be more complicated when some (or all) agents do not have EU. We provide a simple and intuitive examination of the asset pricing implications of heterogeneity for the most commonly used alternatives to EU. Our primary finding is that the risk premium and the risk-free rate are sensitive t",

We focus on New England between 1867 and 1880 and consider the introduction of marital property laws that limited liability for newly wedded bankers.

    "abstract": "We provide evidence that lenders differ in their ex post incentives to internalize price- default externalities associated with the liquidation of collateralized debt. Using the outstanding mortgages on their balance sheets internalize the negative spillovers associated with the liquidation of defaulting mortgages and thus are less inclined to foreclose. We provide evidence consistent with our conjecture. Arguably as a conse- quence, zip codes with a higher concentration of outstanding mortgages experience smaller house prices declines. These results are not driven by unobservable zip code or lender characteristics. Forced Sales OF Real AND Financial Assets fetch prices below their funda- mental values (Shleifer and Vishny (1992)). When markets are illiquid, such sales generate price spillovers that reduce the value of similar assets held by other market participants. This may lead to further defaults and price-default spirals (Kiyotaki and Moore (1997), Gromb and Vayanos (2002), Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2009)).

    "title": "Forecast Dispersion and the Cross",
    "abstract": "Recent work by Diether, Malloy, and Scherbina (2002) has established a negative re- lationship between stock returns and the dispersion of analysts’ earnings forecasts. I offer a simple explanation for this phenomenon based on the interpretation of dis- persion as a proxy for unpriced information risk arising when asset values are un- observable. The relationship then follows from a general options-pricing result: For a levered firm, expected returns should always decrease with the level of idiosyn- cratic asset risk. This story is formalized with a straightforward model. Reasonable parameter values produce large effects, and the theory’s main empirical prediction is supported in cross-sectional tests. IN AN Intriguing Recent Article , Diether, Malloy, and Scherbina (2002) (here- after DMS) document a new anomaly in the cross section of returns: Firms with more uncertain earnings (as measured by the dispersion of analysts’ fore- casts) do worse. The finding is important in that it directly links asset re- turns with a quantitative measure of an economic primitive—information about fundamentals—but the sign of the relationship is apparently wrong. Rather than discounting uncertainty, investors appear to be paying a premium for it. This would seem to pose a formidable challenge to usual notions of efficiently functioning markets. This article argues that the challenge can be met. In fact, a simple, standard asset pricing model implies the DMS effect even when there is no cross-",

    "abstract": "In this paper, I identify shocks to interest rates resulting from two administrative details in adjustable-rate mortgage contract terms: the choice of ﬁnancial index and the choice of lookback period. I ﬁnd that a 1 percentage point increase in interest rate at the time of adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) reset results in a 2.5 percentage increase in the probability of foreclosure in the following year, and that each foreclo- sure ﬁling leads to an additional 0.3 to 0.6 completed foreclosures within a 0.10-mile radius. In explaining this result, I emphasize price effects, bank-supply responses, and borrower responses arising from peer effects. Over 4 Million Completed Foreclosures Took place between January 2007 and December 2010, and another 8.2 million foreclosures were initiated dur- ing the same period (Blomquist (2012)). While the foreclosure crisis remains historic in its aggregate cost to homeowners and investors, understanding the precise mechanisms and channels behind this wave of mortgage defaults re- mains a challenge. In this paper, I examine the role of neighborhood spillover effects from foreclosures as an important ampliﬁcation mechanism behind this foreclosure crisis. There are several plausible mechanisms through which foreclosures can af- fect the default patterns of their geographical peers. First, foreclosures reduce the market price of neighboring homes, which may induce those borrowers to default due to the negative equity that results. Alternatively, lend",

    "abstract": "From 2007 to 2009, states without a judicial requirement for foreclosures weretwice as likely to foreclose on delinquent homeowners. Analysis of borders of states with differing foreclosure laws reveals a discrete jump in foreclosure propensity as one enters nonjudicial states. Using state judicial requirement as an instrument for fore- closures, we show that foreclosures led to a large decline in house prices, residential investment, and consumer demand from 2007 to 2009. As foreclosures subsided from 2011 to 2013, the foreclosure rates in nonjudicial and judicial requirement states converged and we ﬁnd some evidence of a stronger recovery in nonjudicial states. THE Post-2006 Collapse IN Theu.s. Housing market led to a 35% drop in house prices and an increase in mortgage delinquency rate that reached over 10% in 2009. Mortgage contracts give lenders the right to foreclose on a home if the homeowner defaults on his payment obligations. When a major shock hits the economy and millions of homeowners simultaneously default, theory suggests that the ﬁre sale of foreclosed homes could lead to a further reduction in house prices, threatening real activity, such as residential investment and consumer demand.1 As Figure1 shows, the default rate on household debt and foreclosures sky- rocketed from 2006 to 2009, before falling sharply from 2010 to 2013.

A theoretical model shows that when domestic banks are better than foreign banks at monitoring soft information customers, foreign bank entry may hurt these customers and worsen welfare. The model also predicts that credit to the private sector should be lower in countries with more foreign bank penetration, and that foreign banks should have a less risky loan portfolio. In the empirical section, we test these predictions for a sample of lower income countries and find support for the theoretical model. Reform. A rigorous evaluation of these efforts is still work in progress, but avail- able accounts suggest that key deficiencies have been difficult to resolve.1 This paper studies how one aspect of financial sector reform, the entry of foreign banks, affects financial sector development in poor countries. Proponents of foreign banks claim that these banks can achieve better economies of scale and risk diversification than domestic banks, and that they introduce more advanced technology (especially risk management), import bet- ter supervision and regulation, and increase competition. Because they are backed by their parent banks, foreign affiliates of international banks may also be perceived as safer than private domestic banks, especially in times of eco- nomic difficulty.

    "title": "Foreign Safe Asset Demand and the Dollar",
    "abstract": "We develop a theory that links the U.S. Dollar’s valuation in FX markets to the con- venience yield that foreign investors derive from holding U.S. Safe assets. We show that this convenience yield can be inferred from the Treasury basis, the yield gap be- tween U.S. Government and currency-hedged foreign government bonds. Consistent with the theory, a widening of the basis coincides with an immediate appreciation and a subsequent depreciation of the dollar. Our results lend empirical support to models that impute a special role to the United States as the world’s provider of safe assets and the dollar as the world’s reserve currency. IN THE Postwar ERA , THE United States has been the world’s most favored supplier of safe assets. Investors forgo a sizeable return, the convenience yield, to own these assets (see Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen ( 2012), for ex- ample). During episodes of global ﬁnancial instability, there is a ﬂight to the safety of U.S. Treasury bonds as the convenience yield on Treasurys rises. At the same time, the dollar appreciates in foreign currency markets. Our paper develops a theory that explains these stylized facts.

    "abstract": "We propose a cross-sectional time-series model to assess the impact of market lib- eralizations in emerging equity markets on the cost of capital, volatility, beta, and correlation with world market returns. Liberalizations are defined by regulatory changes, the introduction of depositary receipts and country funds, and structural breaks in equity capital flows to the emerging markets. We control for other eco- nomic events that might confound the impact of foreign speculators on local equity markets. Across a range of specifications, the cost of capital always decreases after a capital market liberalization with the effect varying between 5 and 75 basis points. Throughout History AND IN Many Market Economies, the speculator has been characterized as both a villain and a savior. Indeed, the reputation of the speculator generally depends on the country where he does business. In well- functioning advanced capital markets, such as the United States, the specu- lator is viewed as an integral part of the free-market system. In developing capital markets, the speculator, and in particular the international specula- tor, is looked upon with many reservations. Recently, many so-called \"emerging\" markets have opened up their capital impact of increased foreign portfolio investment in developing equity mar- kets.

Plausibly exogenous variation in workers’ exposure to a depression allows us to identify the effects and a new estimation approach makes addressing wealth and income effects possible. We ﬁnd that adversely affected workers are less likely to invest in risky assets. This result is robust to a number of control variables and it holds for individuals whose income, employment, and wealth were unaffected. The effects travel through social networks: individuals whose neighbors and family members experienced adverse circumstances also avoid risky investments. THE Large Degree OF Heterogeneity in how individuals construct ﬁnancial portfolios poses a challenge for theory and empirical work.

    "abstract": "Technical analysis, also known as \"charting,\" has been a part of financial practice for many decades, but this discipline has not received the same level of academic scrutiny and acceptance as more traditional approaches such as fundamental analy- sis. One of the main obstacles is the highly subjective nature of technical analy- sis-the presence of geometric shapes in historical price charts is often in the eyes of the beholder. In this paper, we propose a systematic and automatic approach to technical pattern recognition using nonparametric kernel regression, and we apply this method to a large number of U.S. Stocks from 1962 to 1996 to evaluate the effectiveness of technical analysis. By comparing the unconditional empirical dis- tribution of daily stock returns to the conditional distribution-conditioned on spe- cific technical indicators such as head-and-shoulders or double-bottoms-we find that over the 31-year sample period, several technical indicators do provide incre- mental information and may have some practical value. ONE OF THE Greatest Gulfs between academic finance and industry practice is the separation that exists between technical analysts and their academic critics. In contrast to fundamental analysis, which was quick to be adopted by the scholars of modern quantitative finance, technical analysis has been an orphan from the very start. It has been argued that the difference be- tween fundamental analysis and technical analysis is not unlike the differ- ence",

    "abstract": "We show theoretically that a critical determinant of the attractiveness of venture capital (VC)-backed entrepreneurship for high-earning potential founders is the ex- pected time to develop a startup’s initial product. This is because founder-CEOs’ cash compensation increases substantially after product development, alleviating the non- diversiﬁable risk that founders face at startup birth. Consistent with the model’s pre- dictions of where the supply of entrepreneurial talent is likely to be most constrained, we ﬁnd that technological shocks differentially altering the expected time to product across industries can explain changes in both the rate of entry and characteristics of individuals selecting into VC-backed entrepreneurship. Venture Capital (vc)-backed Startups Play a critical role in the econ- omy due to their disproportionate contribution to corporate R&D and innova- tion (Kortum and Lerner ( 2000), Lerner and Nanda ( 2020)). While a growing literature studies frictions in the provision of VC ﬁnancing to startups seek- ing risk capital, few papers investigate potential constraints to the supply of entrepreneurial talent to VC-backed startups, in particular, to the drivers of selection into VC-backed entrepreneurship.

We find that family ownership is both prevalent and substantial; fa- milies are present in one-third of the S&P 500 and account for 18 percent of outstanding equity. Contrary to our conjecture, we find family firms perform better than nonfamily firms. Additional analysis reveals that the relation be- tween family holdings and firm performance is nonlinear and that when fa- mily members serve as CEO, performance is better than with outside CEOs. Overall, our results are inconsistent with the hypothesis that minority share- holders are adversely affected by family ownership, suggesting that family ownership is an effective organizational structure.

    "abstract": "The probability of extreme default losses on portfolios of U.S. Corporate debt is much greater than would be estimated under the standard assumption that default correla- tion arises only from exposure to observable risk factors. At the high confidence levels at which bank loan portfolio and collateralized debt obligation (CDO) default losses are typically measured for economic capital and rating purposes, conventionally based loss estimates are downward biased by a full order of magnitude on test portfolios. Our estimates are based on U.S. Public nonfinancial firms between 1979 and 2004. We find strong evidence for the presence of common latent factors, even when controlling for observable factors that provide the most accurate available model of firm-by-firm default probabilities. This Paper Provides a more realistic assessment of the risk of large default losses on portfolios of U.S. Corporate debt than had been available with prior methodologies. At the high confidence levels at which portfolio default losses are typically estimated for meeting bank capital requirements and rating col- lateralized debt obligations (CDOs), our empirical results indicate that conven- tional estimators are downward biased by a full order of magnitude on typical test portfolios.

    "title": "Free Cash Flow, Issuance Costs, and Stock Prices",
    "abstract": "We develop a dynamic model of a ﬁrm facing agency costs of free cash ﬂow and external ﬁnancing costs, and derive an explicit solution for the ﬁrm’s optimal balance sheet dynamics. Financial frictions affect issuance and dividend policies, the value of cash holdings, and the dynamics of stock prices. The model predicts that the marginal value of cash varies negatively with the stock price, and positively with the volatility of the stock price. This yields novel insights on the asymmetric volatility phenomenon, on risk management policies, and on how business cycles and agency costs affect the volatility of stock returns. Following Easterbrook (1984) AND Jensen (1986), an inﬂuential branch of the corporate ﬁnance literature emphasizes the role of payout policies in address- ing agency conﬂicts between corporate insiders and outside shareholders.1 The central idea of this literature is that proﬁts that are not paid out to sharehold- ers can be diverted by insiders to their own advantage. For instance, ﬁrms’ managers may commit these funds to inefﬁcient projects that generate private beneﬁts for themselves, to the detriment of outside shareholders. As pointed out by Jensen (1986), this conﬂict over payout policies is particularly severe when ﬁrms hold substantial amounts of free cash ﬂow, that is, when cash inﬂows signiﬁcantly exceed efﬁcient reinvestment needs or opportunities.

    "abstract": "HOW DID THE Collapse of the asset-backed securities (ABS) market during the 2007 to 2009 ﬁnancial crisis affect the supply of credit to the broader economy? Using new data on the U.S. Credit union industry, we ﬁnd that ABS-related losses are associated with a large contraction in the supply of credit to consumers, especially among those credit unions that began the crisis with weaker capitalization. We also ﬁnd that this credit supply shock restricted the availability of mortgage and automobile credit. These results show how movements in the prices of ﬁnancial assets can affect the real economy. THE Proximate Cause of the 2007 to 2009 ﬁnancial crisis centered around the collapse of the housing bubble in the United States. Mortgages and other loans were securitized into asset-backed securities (ABS), which were held on banks’ balance sheets and widely distributed throughout the ﬁnancial system. Falling housing prices and rising mortgage defaults then led to sharp declines in the price of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and other types of ABS, raising concerns about the liquidity and solvency of the banking sector (Brunnermeier (2009), Keys et al. ( 2010), Shleifer and Vishny ( 2011)). Less well understood, however, is how the ﬁnancial crisis—initially cen- tered in the ABS market—might have led to the Great Recession. High levels of household leverage during the boom in conjunction with falling housing prices during the bust may have depressed consumer demand, leading to the",

    "abstract": "This paper estimates the effect of news positioning on the speed of price discovery, using exogenous variation in prominent (“front-page”) positioning of news articles on the Bloomberg terminal. Front-page articles see 240% higher trading volume and 176% larger absolute excess returns during the ﬁrst 10 minutes after publication than equally important non-front-page articles. Overall, the information in front- page articles is fully incorporated into prices within an hour of publication.

TO What Extent Does THE way information is delivered by the media in- ﬂuence the price discovery process? In classic efﬁcient markets, presentation and positioning of news by the media should have no effect, with information efﬁciently reﬂected in prices regardless of presentation.

    "title": "Fully Closed: Individual Responses to Realized",
    "abstract": "We analyze how individuals reinvest realized capital gains and losses exploiting plau- sibly exogenous sales due to mutual fund liquidations. Individuals reinvest 83% if a forced sale results in a gain relative to the initial investment; but reinvest only 40% in the event of a loss. This difference is statistically signiﬁcant for more than six months and arises because many individuals forced to realize a loss choose not to reinvest anything and some even exit the stock market altogether. Individuals treat realized losses differently from paper losses and are discouraged from investing more and participating in the stock market. THE Survey OF Consumer Finances (SCF) documents that only 52% of households in the United States participate in the stock market and that these households invest only approximately 40% of their wealth in stocks (Cupák et al., 2020). Stock market nonparticipation and low portfolio shares are sur- prising to ﬁnancial economists because stocks have historically outperformed may be reluctant to invest in stocks because they worry about losses (Barberis, thank the two anonymous referees; Matthew Rabin; Paul Tetlock; Jonathan Parker; Alex Imas; Gautam Rao; Miguel Anton; Chris Mayer; Alessandro Previtero; Benjamin Loos; Ed Glaeser; Ste- fan Nagel; Stefan Ruenzli; Martin Weber; Justine Hastings; Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh; Florian Pe- ters; Marina Gertsberg; Kent Daniel; Gur Huberman; Francesco D’Acunto; and Johannes Wohlfart for valuable comments, as well as sem",

    "abstract": "Weshow theoretically that the responsiveness of a fund manager’s portfolio allocations to changes in public information decreases in the manager’s skill. We go on to estimate this sensitivity (RPI)a st h eR2 of the regression of changes in a manager’s portfolio holdings on changes in public information using a panel of U.S. Equity funds. Consis- tent with RPI containing information related to managerial skills, we find a strong inverse relationship between RPI and various existing measures of performance, and between RPI and fund flows.

THE Concept OF Sophisticated Investors permeates the economic literature in several areas, including market microstructure, tests of the efficient market hypothesis, and the performance evaluation of financial institutions. Sandroni (2000, p.1303) succinctly describes these investors as those who “are consis- tently better in predicting prices.” Whether such investors exist and whether they outperform others has been the subject of debate for at least a few decades, particularly in the literature on mutual funds. Specifically, while a vast number of performance measures have been proposed and extensively used to identify successful fund managers, 1 several studies question whether these measures actually capture managerial skills, given existing alternative explanations, such as luck, model misspecification, survivorship bias, or weak statistical DiNardo for numerous",

    "title": "Funding Liquidity without Banks: Evidence from",
    "abstract": "In 2011, Colombia instituted a tax on repayment of bank loans, which increased the cost of short-term bank credit more than long-term credit. Firms responded by cutting short-term loans for liquidity management purposes and increasing the use of cash and trade credit. In industries in which trade credit is more accessible (based on U.S. Compustat ﬁrms), we ﬁnd substitution into accounts payable and little effect on cash and investment. Where trade credit is less available, ﬁrms increase cash and cut investment. Thus, trade credit provides an alternative source of liquidity that can insulate some ﬁrms from bank liquidity shocks. HOW DO Firms Manage Liquidity? Most of the economics and ﬁnance literature focuses on the banking system, with banks acting as the primary supplier of liquidity and payment mechanisms between counterparties. Cash, demand deposits, and credit lines—or equivalently, very short-term bank loans—are fundamental payment products supplied almost uniquely by banks (Kashyap, Rajan, and Stein (2002), Gatev and Strahan (2009)). Many ﬁrms use credit lines to smooth out liquidity needs over time, drawing funds when payments need to be made (e.g., to make payroll or to pay for supplies) and repaying those funds when payments are received (e.g., after realizing sales receipts). Demand deposits and credit lines differ mainly in that the latter include a credit aspect (they are not prefunded by the customer), whereas the former do not. Firms with limited access to line",

    "title": "Funding Value Adjustments",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we demonstrate that the funding value adjustments (FVAs) of major dealers are debt overhang costs to their shareholders. To maximize shareholder value, dealer quotations therefore adjust for FVAs. Our case studies include interest-rate swap FVAs and violations of covered interest parity. Contrary to current valuation practice, FVAs are not themselves components of the market values of the positions being ﬁnanced. Current dealer practice does, however, align incentives between trad- ing desks and shareholders. We also establish a pecking order for preferred asset ﬁnancing strategies and provide a new interpretation of the standard debit value adjustment. IN This Paper, WE Calculate THE DEBToverhang costs to dealer-bank sharehold- ers associated with ﬁnancing new balance sheet positions. For debt-ﬁnanced swap positions, we show that these shareholder costs are equal to the funding value adjustments (FVAs) that dealers make to the reported market values of their swap books. Contrary to this dealer practice, however, FVAs are not actu- ally components of the market values of the positions being ﬁnanced. Instead, they are debt-overhang transfers from shareholders to creditors. We show that dealer bid and ask quotes, if aligned with shareholder interests, must incorporate the debt overhang costs that FVAs represent. That is, to maximize their shareholders’ equity value, dealers must quote so as to extract enough trading proﬁt from their counterparties to overcome the",

    "abstract": "We characterize generalized disappointment aversion (GDA) risk preferences that can overweight lower-tail outcomes relative to expected utility. We show in an en- dowment economy that recursive utility with GDA risk preferences generates effec- tive risk aversion that is countercyclical. This feature comes from endogenous varia- tion in the probability of disappointment in the representative agent’s intertemporal consumption-saving problem that underlies the asset pricing model. The variation in effective risk aversion produces a large equity premium and a risk-free rate that is procyclical and has low volatility in an economy with a simple autoregressive endowment-growth process. THE Observed Facts OF Aggregate risks and asset prices in the post-war U.S. Economy have led researchers to explore models of intertemporal preferences that generalize the well-developed time-additive expected utility speciﬁcation used in the asset pricing economy of Lucas (1978). In particular, models that allow for countercyclical risk aversion have been shown to perform much bet- ter than the standard model (see, e.g., Campbell and Cochrane (1999), Gordon and St-Amour (2000), and Barberis, Huang, and Santos (2001)). 1 This leads us to explore the preference foundations that may produce this behavior en- dogenously. Our preference speciﬁcation is a one-parameter extension of the Gul (1991) disappointment aversion utility function. These new preferences Harjoat Bhamra, Gian Luca Clementi, Eddie Dek",

    "title": "Genetic Variation in Financial Decision-Making",
    "abstract": "Individuals differ in how they construct their investment portfolios, yet empirical models of portfolio risk typically account only for a small portion of the cross-sectional variance. This paper asks whether genetic variation can explain some of these indi- vidual differences. Following a major pension reform Swedish adults had to form a portfolio from a large menu of funds. We match data on these investment decisions with the Swedish Twin Registry and ﬁnd that approximately 25% of individual varia- tion in portfolio risk is due to genetic variation. We also ﬁnd that these results extend to several other aspects of ﬁnancial decision-making. IT IS Well Known That THE Composition of investment portfolios varies substan- tially across individuals, yet the determinants of these individual differences are not fully understood (Guiso, Haliassos, and Jappelli (2002), Curcuru et al. (2009)). Explaining investor heterogeneity is relevant to a number of prominent but unsettled debates in ﬁnance. Importantly, a better understanding of the determinants of cross-sectional variance leads to facts that theories of portfolio allocation have to be consistent with. For these reasons a voluminous litera- ture seeks to understand heterogeneity in portfolio composition, especially as it pertains to individuals’ willingness to bear ﬁnancial risks. This paper asks whether genetic variation can help explain heterogeneity in portfolio risk. In particular, this paper builds on a recent string of pape",

Using Nasdaq Post- Data, we find a disproportionate increase in market making volume associated with the firm’s recommendation changes and evidence of elevated sell volume at the rec- ommending analyst’s firm in the 2 days preceding a downgrade. The implications are that the information source matters in determining the placement of trades and that the issuing analyst’s firm appears to be rewarded for prereleasing information through increased volume.

    "abstract": "I quantitatively measure the interactions between the media and the stock market using daily content from a popularWall Street Journalcolumn. I find that high media pessimism predicts downward pressure on market prices followed by a reversion to fundamentals, and unusually high or low pessimism predicts high market trading volume. These and similar results are consistent with theoretical models of noise and liquidity traders, and are inconsistent with theories of media content as a proxy for new information about fundamental asset values, as a proxy for market volatility, or as a sideshow with no relationship to asset markets. One of the more fascinating sections of the WSJ is on the inside of the back page under the standing headline “Abreast of the Market.” There you can read each day what the market did yesterday, whether it went up, down or sideways as measured by indexes like the Dow Jones Industrial Average ... . In that column, you can also read selected post-mortems from brokerage houses, stock analysts and other professional track watchers explaining why the market yesterday did whatever it did, sometimes with predictive nuggets about what it will do today or tomorrow. This is where the fascination lies. For no matter what the market did—up, down or sideways—somebody will have a ready explanation.

    "title": "Global Currency Hedging",
    "abstract": "Over the period 1975 to 2005, the U.S. Dollar (particularly in relation to the Canadian dollar), the euro, and the Swiss franc (particularly in the second half of the period) moved against world equity markets. Thus, these currencies should be attractive to risk-minimizing global equity investors despite their low average returns. The risk-minimizing currency strategy for a global bond investor is close to a full currency hedge, with a modest long position in the U.S. Dollar. There is little evidence that risk- minimizing investors should adjust their currency positions in response to movements in interest differentials. What Role Should FOREIGNcurrency play in a diversiﬁed investment portfolio? In practice, many investors appear reluctant to hold foreign currency directly, perhaps because they see currency as an investment with high volatility and low average return. At the same time, many investors hold indirect positions in foreign currency when they buy foreign equities or bonds without hedging the currency exposure implied by the foreign asset holding. Such investors receive the foreign currency excess return on their foreign assets, plus the return on foreign currency. In this paper, we consider an investor with an exogenous portfolio of equities or bonds and ask how the investor can use foreign currency to manage the risk of the portfolio. We assume that the investor’s domestic money market is riskless in real terms, and use mean-variance analysis to ﬁnd the foreign cu",

    "abstract": "Using a sample of 44,288 firm-years between 1984 and 1997, we document an increase in the extent of global diversification over time. This trend does not re- flect a substitution of global for industrial diversification. We also find that global diversification results in average valuation discounts of approximately the same magnitude as those for industrial diversification. Analysis of the changes in excess value associated with changes in diversification reveals that increases in global diversification reduce excess value, while reductions in global diversification in- crease excess value. These findings support the view that the costs of global di- versification outweigh the benefits. A Considerable Fraction OF U.S. Corporations diversify their operations, either across multiple lines of business (industrial diversification), across different national markets (global diversification), or both. Over the past decade, an extensive academic literature has developed documenting the causes and consequences of industrial diversification. Studies in this literature report that, on average, diversified firms are valued at a discount relative to a portfolio of comparable, single-segment firms. This value discount appears to stem, in part, from inefficient investment policies. In addition, the evi- dence indicates a trend towards less industrial diversification since the mid- 1980s, as well as a gain in shareholder value associated with refocusing strategies.1 Because industrial dive",

    "abstract": "We propose an exogenous measure of a country’s growth opportunities by interacting the country’s local industry mix with global price to earnings (PE) ratios. We find that these exogenous growth opportunities predict future changes in real GDP and investment in a large panel of countries. This relation is strongest in countries that have liberalized their capital accounts, equity markets, and banking systems. We also find that financial development, external finance dependence, and investor protection measures are much less important in aligning growth opportunities with growth than is capital market openness. Finally, we formulate new tests of market integration and segmentation by linking local and global PE ratios to relative economic growth. IN A Perfectly Integrated World economy, capital should be invested where it real variables and quantities is strongly at odds with the notion of global inte- gration. For example, in their classic study of 16 developed countries, Feldstein and Horioka (1980) find a home bias in real investments. In particular, they show that domestic saving rates explain over 90% of the variation in invest- ment rates. Because the Feldstein and Horioka sample ends in 1974, it does not reflect the considerable progress toward globalization in the 1970s and 1980s. However, Obstfeld and Rogoff (2000) continue to find a high correlation between domestic investment and savings for the 1990 to 1997 period, both for the Oecd countries and a group of mid-inc",

Carbon premia related to emissions growth are greater for ﬁrms located in countries with lower economic development, larger energy sectors, and less inclu- sive political systems. Premia related to emission levels are higher in countries with stricter domestic climate policies. The latter have increased with investor awareness about climate change risk.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the impact of noise traders’ limited attention on ﬁnancial markets. Speciﬁcally, we exploit episodes of sensational news (exogenous to the mar- ket) that distract noise traders. We ﬁnd that on “distraction days,” trading activity, liquidity, and volatility decrease, and prices reverse less among stocks owned pre- dominantly by noise traders. These outcomes contrast sharply with those due to the inattention of informed speculators and market makers, and are consistent with noise traders mitigating adverse selection risk. We discuss the evolution of these outcomes over time and the role of technological changes. THE Literature ON Limited Attention in ﬁnancial markets focuses on informed agents—speculators and market makers—and on the speed with which they impound public information into stock prices. Less is known about how atten- tion might affect a third, equally important, group of agents: noise traders. By trading stocks for reasons unrelated to stock fundamentals, noise traders allow speculators to proﬁt from their information and market makers to recoup losses from trading with speculators. As summarized by Fisher Black in his Presidential Address, “Noise Makes Financial Markets Possible” (Black ( 1986, p. 530)). In this paper, we aim to improve our understanding of how the limited attention of noise traders affects ﬁnancial markets. Toward that end, we con- sider events that distract noise traders and we trace out their consequences for markets. W",

    "title": "Going Public without Governance:",
    "abstract": "This paper addresses the agency problem between controlling shareholders and minority shareholders. This problem is common among public firms in many coun- tries where the legal system does not effectively protect minority shareholders against oppression by controlling shareholders. We show that even without any explicit corporate governance mechanisms protecting minority shareholders, con- trolling shareholders can implicitly commit not to expropriate them. Stock prices of such companies are significantly higher and firms are more likely go public because of this reputation effect. Moreover, insiders divest shares gradually over time, at a rate that is negatively related to the degree of moral hazard. Porate finance issue is not the traditional agency problem between manage- ment and shareholders, but rather the agency problem between the controlling shareholders and the minority shareholders. This problem may arise in some countries for two reasons: (1) the corporate governance structure of public companies insulates large shareholders-that is, those with a majority of the votes and often with an involvement in the firm's management-from takeover threats or monitoring;1 and (2) the legal system does not protect minority shareholders because of either poor laws or poor enforcement of laws.2 Despite the lack of protection for minority shareholders, the average ratio of stock market capitalization held by minorities to gross national product is greater than 40 percent in a sam",

    "title": "Going the Extra Mile: Distant Lending",
    "abstract": "The average distance of U.S. Banks from their small corporate borrowers increased before the global ﬁnancial crisis, especially for banks in competitive counties. Small distant loans are harder to make, so loan quality deteriorated. Surprisingly, such lending intensiﬁed as the Fed raised interest rates from 2004. Why? We show that banks’ responses to higher rates led bank deposits to shift into competitive counties. Short-horizon bank management recycled these inﬂows into risky loans to distant uncompetitive counties. Thus, rate hikes, competition, and managerial short-termism explain why inﬂows “burned a hole” in banks’ pockets and, more generally, increased risky lending. Descriptions OF Financial Frenzies Suggest that lenders abandon cau- tion in the midst of a boom and become more aggressive (or careless) in their lending (see, for example, Aliber and Kindleberger ( 2017), Minsky and Kauf- man ( 2008)). A number of studies (e.g., Giannetti and Laeven ( 2012), Mad- daloni and Peydró ( 2010), Mian and Suﬁ ( 2009), Lisowsky, Minnis, and Suther- land (2017), Rajan and Ramcharan ( 2015)) show that lenders’ credit standards are procyclical. However, not all expansions turn into frenzies, lenders do not become uniformly exuberant in a frenzy across all regions or sectors in a coun- try, and not all lenders within a region behave in the same way.

    "abstract": "Psychological evidence and casual intuition predict that sunny weather is as- sociated with upbeat mood. This paper examines the relationship between morning sunshine in the city of a country's leading stock exchange and daily market index returns across 26 countries from 1982 to 1997. Sunshine is strongly significantly correlated with stock returns. After controlling for sun- shine, rain and snow are unrelated to returns. Substantial use of weather- based strategies was optimal for a trader with very low transactions costs. However, because these strategies involve frequent trades, fairly modest costs eliminate the gains. These findings are difficult to reconcile with fully rational price setting. Sunshine Affects Mood, as evidenced by song and verse, daily experience, and formal psychological studies. But does sunlight affect the stock market? The traditional efficient markets view says no, with minor qualifications. If sun- light affects the weather, it can affect agricultural and perhaps other weather- related firms. But in modern economies in which agriculture plays a modest role, it seems unlikely that whether it is cloudy outside the stock exchange today should affect the rational price of the nation's stock market index. (Even in coun- tries where agriculture plays a large role, it is not clear that one day of sunshine versus cloud cover at the stock exchange should be very informative about har- vest yield.) An alternative view is that sunlight affects mood, and that",

    "abstract": "I study asset prices in a general equilibrium framework in which agents form habits over individual varieties of goods rather than over an aggregate consumption bun- dle. Goods are produced by monopolistically competitive ﬁrms whose elasticities of demand depend on consumers’ habit formation. Firms that produce goods with a high habit level relative to consumption have low demand elasticities, set high prices for their product, have low expected returns on their stock, and have low asset pricing betas and stock return volatilities. I ﬁnd supportive evidence for these predictions in the data. A Substantial PARTof the empirical asset pricing literature attempts to explain the cross-section of stock prices and returns. Habit formation models have suc- cessfully explained some properties of the time series of stock prices.1 Using them to explain the cross-section, however, has been more challenging.2 In this paper, I present a model with good-speciﬁc habit formation that is capa- ble of generating expected return spreads while matching important features of prices and quantities in the data, both in the time series and in the cross- section. The intuition is as follows. Monopolistically competitive ﬁrms offer individual varieties of goods. The demand elasticities of each monopolist are ously circulated under the title “Deep Habits and the Cross-Section of Expected Returns.” I would like to thank the Editor, Associate Editor, and an anonymous referee for many useful and detailed c",

    "title": "Governance Mechanisms and Equity Prices",
    "abstract": "We investigate how the market for corporate control (external governance) and share- holder activism (internal governance) interact. A portfolio that buys firms with the highest level of takeover vulnerability and shorts firms with the lowest level of takeover vulnerability generates an annualized abnormal return of 10% to 15% only when public pension fund (blockholder) ownership is high as well. A similar portfolio created to capture the importance of internal governance generates annualized ab- normal returns of 8%, though only in the presence of “high” vulnerability to takeovers. The complementarity effect exists for firms with lower industry-adjusted leverage and is stronger for smaller firms. A Variety OF Firm -level Mechanisms ARE Associated With the governance of the public corporation. 1 These firm-level mechanisms can be classified into two broad categories—internal and external governance mechanisms. Blockhold- ers and the board of directors are often seen as the primary internal monitor- ing mechanism, 2 while takeovers and the market for corporate control are the primary external mechanism.3 These different mechanisms work together in a system to affect governance in firms. This paper attempts to provide a better understanding of how these governance mechanisms interact. We ask three questions: How do the internal and external governance mechanisms interact to affect equity prices? How does this interaction depend on firm characteristics such as size and leverage?",

    "abstract": "Using proprietary data from the China Development Bank (CDB), this paper exam- ines the effects of government credit on ﬁrm activities. Tracing the effects of govern- ment credit across different levels of the supply chain, I ﬁnd that CDB industrial loans to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) crowd out private ﬁrms in the same industry but crowd in private ﬁrms in downstream industries. On average, a $1 increase in CDB SOE loans leads to a $0.20 decrease in private ﬁrms’ assets. Moreover, CDB infras- tructure loans crowd in private ﬁrms. I use exogenous timing of municipal politicians’ turnover as an instrument for CDB credit ﬂows. Government-directed Lending PROGRAMSare pervasive around the world and are often justiﬁed as a way to support economic development.1 A central ques- tion in the debate on government credit is whether it crowds out or crowds in private-sector activities. The theoretical literature suggests that government credit can have many countervailing effects. On the one hand, government credit that supports high social return projects such as infrastructure can have positive spillover effects (e.g., Stiglitz (1993)). On the other hand, government credit might crowd out more productive private-sector investments (e.g., King and Levine (1993a, 1993b)).

    "title": "Government Intervention and Information",
    "abstract": "Governments intervene in ﬁrms’ lives in a variety of ways. To enhance the efﬁciency of government intervention, many researchers and policy makers call for governments to make use of information contained in stock market prices. However, price informa- tiveness is endogenous to government policy. We analyze government policy in light of this endogeneity. In some cases, it is optimal for a government to commit to limit its reliance on market prices to avoid harming the aggregation of information into mar- ket prices. For similar reasons, it is optimal for a government to limit transparency in some dimensions. OUR Paper IS Motivated BY TWOkey observations. First, governments play an important role in the lives of ﬁrms and ﬁnancial institutions, and take actions that have signiﬁcant implications for these ﬁrms’ cash ﬂows and stock prices. Second, government actions often follow ﬁnancial market movements; and, closely related, many government ofﬁcials view market prices as a useful source of information, and a number of policy proposals advocate making more explicit use of this information.

    "title": "Government Ownership of Banks",
    "abstract": "We assemble data on government ownership of banks around the world. The data show that such ownership is large and pervasive, and higher in countries with low levels of per capita income, backward financial systems, interventionist and inef- ficient governments, and poor protection of property rights. Higher government ownership of banks in 1970 is associated with slower subsequent financial devel- opment and lower growth of per capita income and productivity. This evidence supports \"political\" theories of the effects of government ownership of firms. This Paper Discusses A Neglected Aspect of financial systems of many coun- tries: government ownership of banks. It shows that such ownership is per- vasive around the world, and has had significant consequences for economic and financial development. There are two broad views of the government's participation in financial markets. The first, basically optimistic, \"development\" view is associated with Alexander Gerschenkron (1962), who focuses on the necessity of finan- cial development for economic growth. Gerschenkron argues that privately owned commercial banks have been the crucial vehicle of channeling savings into industry in several industrializing countries in the second half of the 19th century, especially Germany. However, in some countries-most con- spicuously Russia-economic institutions were not sufficiently developed for private banks to play the crucial development role. \"The scarcity of capital in Russia was such",

    "abstract": "We investigate the effect of growth opportunities in a firm’s investment opportunity set on its joint choice of leverage, debt maturity, and covenants. Using a database that contains detailed debt covenant information, we provide large-sample evidence of the incidence of covenants in public debt and construct firm-level indices of bondholder covenant protection. We find that covenant protection is increasing in growth oppor- tunities, debt maturity, and leverage. We also document that the negative relation between leverage and growth opportunities is significantly attenuated by covenant protection, suggesting that covenants can mitigate the agency costs of debt for high growth firms. KEY Elements OF Corporate Financial Policy include the choice of debt level, the maturity structure of debt, and the types of restrictive covenants in the inden- tures. An important feature of these financial policy choices is that they are jointly determined as a function of firm characteristics and the contracting en- vironment. Previous studies examine the joint choice of leverage and maturity. Ours is the first empirical investigation that also accounts for the endogenous choice of covenant structure. We provide large-sample evidence that covenant protection is increasing in growth opportunities, debt maturity, and leverage.

    "title": "Growth Opportunities, Technology Shocks,",
    "abstract": "We explore the impact of investment-speciﬁc technology (IST) shocks on the cross section of stock returns. Using a structural model, we show that IST shocks have a differential effect on the value of assets in place and the value of growth opportunities. This differential sensitivity to IST shocks has two main implications. First, ﬁrm risk premia depend on the contribution of growth opportunities to ﬁrm value. Second, ﬁrms with similar levels of growth opportunities comove with each other, giving rise to the value factor in stock returns and the failure of the conditional Capm. Our empirical tests conﬁrm the model’s predictions. Technological Innovation IS A KEYdeterminant of economic growth. In many cases, technological innovation affects aggregate output and consumption only to the extent that it is implemented through the formation of new capital stock. Since this type of innovation is embodied in new capital goods, it is termed investment-speciﬁc. The magnitude of investment-speciﬁc technical progress can be inferred from the decline in the quality-adjusted price of in- vestment goods.1 Recent literature on real determinants of economic growth emphasizes the role of capital-embodied shocks as an important driver of long- run growth and business cycle ﬂuctuations.2 In this paper, we argue that mous referees, Hengjie Ai, Frederico Belo, Lorenzo Garlappi, Burton Holliﬁeld, Roberto Rigobon, and Toni Whited, and seminar participants at the American Economic Association meeting",

    "abstract": "We develop a model in which a firm can devote effort either to increasing sales growth, or to improving per-unit profit margins. If the firm’s manager cares about the current stock price, she will favor the growth strategy when the market pays more attention to growth numbers. Conversely, it can be rational for the market to weight growth measures more heavily when it is known that the firm is following a growth strategy. This two-way feedback between firms’ strategies and the market’s pricing rule can lead to excess volatility in real variables, even absent any external shocks. IN HIS Company’s Annual Report FOR 2001, Amazon.com founder and CEO Jeffrey Bezos begins his letter to shareholders as follows: In July of last year, Amazon.com reached an important way station. After 4 years of single-minded focus on growth, and then just under 2 years spent almost exclusively on lowering costs, we reached a point where we could afford to balance growth and cost improvement, dedicating resources and staffed projects to both. As this statement suggests, many firms face a fundamental strategic tradeoff: They can focus their efforts on increasing sales growth or on improving profit margins (e.g., by lowering unit costs), but given limits on managerial time and other resources, doing more on one dimension necessarily implies doing less on the other. In other words, the choice of whether to emphasize growth or margins is essentially a multitasking problem of the sort described by, for exa",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a new class of nonaffine models of the term structure of interest rates that is supported by an economy with habit formation. Distinguishing features of the model are that the interest rate dynamics are nonlinear, interest rates depend on lagged monetary and consumption shocks, and the price of risk is not a constant multiple of interest rate volatility. We find that habit persistence can help reproduce the nonlinearity of the spot rate process, the documented deviations from the expec- tations hypothesis, the persistence of the conditional volatility of interest rates, and the lead-lag relationship between interest rates and monetary aggregates. IN This Paper , we propose a new class of models for the term structure of in- terest rates that link the fundamentals of a monetary economy with habit for- mation and the dynamics of the yield curve. We begin by providing testable restrictions on how the dynamics of the nominal yield curve depend on both the habit stock and monetary factors. We then use data on nominal bonds to study whether habit persistence can help explain some of the empirical regularities highlighted by the existing term structure literature. Both the economics and the psychology literatures stress the importance of interpersonal effects and time nonseparabilities in consumption choices.

In the legal marijuana in- dustry, where only half of businesses have access to cash management services from a ﬁnancial institution, we examine dispensary proﬁtability using administrative and survey data. Our results show that businesses with cash management charge higher retail prices (8.3%), pay lower wholesale prices (7.3%), and have higher sales volume (19%). Together, these advantages create a 40% increase in proﬁtability. These re- sults support our model in which reputational capital and administrative costs drive proﬁtability regardless of whether national banks, credit unions, or ﬁntech provide the cash management functions.

    "title": "Have Individual Stocks Become More Volatile?",
    "abstract": "This paper uses a disaggregated approach to study the volatility of common stocks at the market, industry, and firm levels. Over the period from 1962 to 1997 there has been a noticeable increase in firm-level volatility relative to market volatility. Accordingly, correlations among individual stocks and the explanatory power of the market model for a typical stock have declined, whereas the number of stocks needed to achieve a given level of diversification has increased. All the volatility measures move together countercyclically and help to predict GDP growth. Market volatility tends to lead the other volatility series. Factors that may be responsible for these findings are suggested. IT IS BY NOW A Commonplace Observation that the volatility of the aggregate stock market is not constant, but changes over time. Economists have built increasingly sophisticated statistical models to capture this time variation in volatility. Simple filters such as the rolling standard deviation used by Officer ~1973! Have given way to parametric Arch or stochastic-volatility models. Partial surveys of the enormous literature on these models are given by Bollerslev, Chou, and Kroner ~1992!, Hentschel ~1995!, Ghysels, Harvey, and Renault ~1996!, and Campbell, Lo, and MacKinlay ~1997, Chapter 12 !.

    "title": "Have Rating Agencies Become More",
    "abstract": "Rating agencies have become more conservative in assigning corporate credit ratings over the period 1985 to 2009; holding ﬁrm characteristics constant, average ratings have dropped by three notches. This change does not appear to be fully warranted because defaults have declined over this period. Firms affected more by conservatism issue less debt, have lower leverage, hold more cash, are less likely to obtain a debt rating, and experience lower growth. Their debt spreads are lower than those of unaffected ﬁrms with the same rating, which implies that the market partly undoes the impact of conservatism on debt prices. This evidence suggests that ﬁrms and capital markets do not perceive the increase in conservatism to be fully warranted. In the wake of the ﬁnancial crisis, rating agencies have come under increased scrutiny. They have been accused of peddling to the companies and institutions that issue the securities they rate, because the issuers pay their fees in most instances. According to some observers, this conﬂict of interest led the agencies to relax their standards, leading to ratings that were too generous relative to the default risk of the securities.1 Given that many ﬁnancial institutions made We would like to thank two anonymous referees, an anonymous Associate Editor, Aysun Alp, Jo˜ao Cocco, Paolo Colla, David Gillmor, Cam Harvey, Craig MacKinlay, Igor Makarov, Paolo Pasquar- iello, Stephen Schaefer, Denis Sosyura, Ilya Strebulaev, Yili Zhang, and seminar parti",

    "abstract": "Using a large hand-collected data set from 2001 to 2006, we find that activist hedge funds in the United States propose strategic, operational, and financial remedies and attain success or partial success in two-thirds of the cases. Hedge funds seldom seek control and in most cases are nonconfrontational. The abnormal return around the announcement of activism is approximately 7%, with no reversal during the subse- quent year. Target firms experience increases in payout, operating performance, and higher CEO turnover after activism. Our analysis provides important new evidence on the mechanisms and effects of informed shareholder monitoring. Although Hedge Fund Activism IS WIDELYdiscussed and fundamentally important, it remains poorly understood. Much of the commentary on hedge fund activism is based on supposition or anecdotal evidence. Critics and regulators question whether hedge fund activism benefits shareholders, while numerous commen- tators claim that hedge fund activists destroy value by distracting managers from long-term projects. However, there is a dearth of large-sample evidence about hedge fund activism, and existing samples are plagued by various biases.

    "abstract": "Deﬁning contagion as correlation over and above that expected from economic funda- mentals, we ﬁnd strong evidence of worst return contagion across hedge fund styles for 1990 to 2008. Large adverse shocks to asset and hedge fund liquidity strongly increase the probability of contagion. Speciﬁcally, large adverse shocks to credit spreads, the TED spread, prime broker and bank stock prices, stock market liquidity, and hedge fund ﬂows are associated with a signiﬁcant increase in the probability of hedge fund contagion. While shocks to liquidity are important determinants of performance, these shocks are not captured by commonly used models of hedge fund returns. Using Monthly Hedge Fund Index Data for the period January 1990 to October 2008, we ﬁnd that the worst hedge fund returns, deﬁned as returns that fall in the bottom 10% of a hedge fund style’s monthly returns, cluster across styles. Further, using both parametric and semi-parametric analyses, we show that this clustering cannot be explained by risk factors commonly used to explain hedge fund performance. Bekaert, Harvey, and Ng (2005 p. 40) deﬁne contagion as “correlation over and above what one would expect from economic fundamentals.” With this deﬁnition, the clustering we observe is contagion. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to test for and document the existence of hedge fund contagion. To understand the determinants of hedge fund contagion, we turn to a re- cent paper by Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2009) for",

    "title": "Hedge Fund Risk Dynamics: Implications",
    "abstract": "Accurate appraisal of hedge fund performance must recognize the freedom with which managers shift asset classes, strategies, and leverage in response to changing market conditions and arbitrage opportunities. The standard measure of performance is the abnormal return defined by a hedge fund’s exposure to risk factors. If exposures are assumed constant when, in fact, they vary through time, estimated abnormal returns may be incorrect. We employ an optimal changepoint regression that allows risk ex- posures to shift, and illustrate the impact on performance appraisal using a sample of live and dead funds during the period January 1994 through December 2005. Hedge Fund Managers are generally free to change trading strategies, leverage, and allocations to different asset classes. 1 These changes can be in response to macro-economic conditions. During the weeks surrounding the Long Term Capital Management crisis, for example, hedge fund managers reduced lever- age and reallocated portfolios to less volatile instruments. The changes can also be in response to arbitrage opportunities, as illustrated by the cycles of M&A activity and the corresponding level of risk arbitrage conducted by hedge funds. From an investor’s perspective, the dynamic nature of hedge funds com- plicates due diligence activities including risk management and performance appraisal. The standard approach to evaluate fund performance is to regress fund re- turns on risk factors that proxy for different trading s",

    "title": "Hedge Funds and Chapter 11",
    "abstract": "This paper studies the presence of hedge funds in the Chapter 11 process and their effects on bankruptcy outcomes. Hedge funds strategically choose positions in the capital structure where their actions could have a bigger impact on value. Their presence, especially as unsecured creditors, helps balance power between the debtor and secured creditors. Their effect on the debtor manifests in higher probabilities of the latter’s loss of exclusive rights to ﬁle reorganization plans, CEO turnover, and adoptions of key employee retention plan, while their effect on secured creditors manifests in higher probabilities of emergence and payoffs to junior claims. This Paper Examines THE roles of hedge funds in Chapter 11 and the effects of their presence on the nature and outcome of the bankruptcy process. Hedge funds’ participation in the bankruptcy process takes a variety of forms, includ- ing investing in debt claims, buying equity stakes, serving on the unsecured creditors or equity committee, and pursuing a “loan-to-own” strategy, whereby a hedge fund acquires the debt of a distressed borrower with the intention of converting the acquired position into a controlling equity stake upon the ﬁrm’s emergence from Chapter 11. Using a comprehensive sample of 474 Chapter 11 cases from 1996 to 2007 formed by merging a variety of data sources, we show that hedge fund presence Sam Guo, Bobby Huang, and Greg Klochkoff.

    "abstract": "This paper documents that hedge funds did not exert a correcting force on stock prices during the technology bubble. Instead, they were heavily invested in technology stocks. This does not seem to be the result of unawareness of the bubble: Hedge funds captured the upturn, but, by reducing their positions in stocks that were about to decline, avoided much of the downturn. Our findings question the efficient markets notion that rational speculators always stabilize prices. They are consistent with models in which rational investors may prefer to ride bubbles because of predictable investor sentiment and limits to arbitrage. Technology Stocks ON Nasdaq Rose to unprecedented levels during the 2 years leading up to March 2000. Ofek and Richardson (2002) estimate that at the peak, the entire internet sector, comprising several hundred stocks, was priced as if theaverage future earnings growth rate across all these firms would exceed the growth rates experienced by some of the fastest growing individual firms in the past, and, at the same time, the required rate of return would be 0% for the next few decades. By almost any standard, these valuation levels are so extreme that this period appears to be another episode in the history of asset price bubbles. Shiller (2000) argues that the stock price increase was driven by irrational euphoria among individual investors, fed by an emphatic media, which maxi- mized TV ratings and catered to investor demand for pseudonews.

    "title": "Hedge Funds: Performance, Risk,",
    "abstract": "We use a comprehensive data set of funds-of-funds to investigate performance, risk, and capital formation in the hedge fund industry from 1995 to 2004. While the average fund-of-funds delivers alpha only in the period between October 1998 and March 2000, a subset of funds-of-funds consistently delivers alpha. The alpha-producing funds are not as likely to liquidate as those that do not deliver alpha, and experience far greater and steadier capital inflows than their less fortunate counterparts. These capital inflows attenuate the ability of the alpha producers to continue to deliver alpha in the future. Hedge Funds ARE Lightly Regulated active investment vehicles with great trad- ing flexibility. They are believed to pursue highly sophisticated investment strategies, and promise to deliver returns to their investors that are unaffected by the vagaries of financial markets. The assets managed by hedge funds have grown substantially over the past decade, increasingly driven by portfolio al- locations from institutional investors. 1 Hedge funds have also been attracting attention from academics, who have recently documented several interesting facts. First, a large proportion of the variation in hedge fund returns can be explained by market-related factors (see, for example, Fung and Hsieh (1997, 2001, 2002, 2004a, 2004b), Agarwal and Naik (2004), and Hasanhodzic and Lo (2006)). 2 This suggests that hedge fund fees (which are often substantial fractions of the total returns earn",

    "title": "Hedging in the Possible Presence of Unspanned",
    "abstract": "This paper examines whether higher order multifactor models, with state variables linked solely to underlying LIBOR-swap rates, are by themselves capable of explaining and hedging interest rate derivatives, or whether models explicitly exhibiting features such as unspanned stochastic volatility are can be well hedged with Libor bonds alone. We examine the potential bene- fits of looking outside the Libor market for factors that might impact swap- tion prices without impacting swap rates, and find them to be minor, indicating that the swaption market is well integrated with the LIBOR-swap market. Understanding THE Dynamics OF THE Term structure of interest rates is crucial for pricing and hedging fixed income positions. It is therefore not surprising that this subject continues to attract keen interest. In the last decade, research- ers have focused their attention on term structure models where the yield to ma- turity is an affine function of the underlying state variables.1 The empirical literature has evolved from studying one-factor diffusions to studying multifac- tor models that incorporate stochastic central tendency, stochastic volatility, jumps, and nontrivial correlations among state variables. With respect to derivatives, Chacko and Das (2002) show that there are computational advan- tages in pricing certain claims in the affine class, where simple solutions often exist.

    "title": "Hedging or Market Timing? Selecting",
    "abstract": "This paper examines whether firms are hedging or timing the market when selecting the interest rate exposure of their new debt issuances. I use a more accurate measure of the interest rate exposure chosen by firms by combining the initial exposure of newly issued debt securities with their use of interest rate swaps. The results indicate that the final interest rate exposure is largely driven by the slope of the yield curve at the time the debt is issued. These results suggest that interest rate risk management practices are primarily driven by speculation or myopia, not hedging considerations. When Firms Select THE Interest Rate exposure of their liabilities and use deriva- tives to alter that exposure, are they hedging or timing the market? The em- pirical literature has attempted to estimate the sources of value creation stem- ming from hedging by examining the cross-sectional variation in the use of derivatives by firms (see Nance, Smith, and Smithson (1993), Mian (1996), and Graham and Rogers (2002), for instance). Implicit in most of these examinations is the assumption that firms use derivatives solely for the purpose of hedging. However, before we can estimate the value created by hedging through the se- lection of firms’ interest rate exposures, we must document that the choices of those exposures are for the purpose of hedging, and not attempts to reduce their cost of capital. This paper addresses that issue. Focusing on the selection of the interest rate exposure o",

    "abstract": "Agents with heterogeneous beliefs about fundamental growth do not share risks per- fectly but instead speculate with each other on the relative accuracy of their mod- els’ predictions. They face the risk that market prices move more in line with the trading models of competing agents than with their own. Less risk-averse agents speculate more aggressively and demand higher risk premiums. My calibrated model generates countercyclical consumption volatility, earnings forecast dispersion, and cross-sectional consumption dispersion. With a risk aversion coefficient less than one, agents’ speculation causes half the observed equity premium and lowers the riskless rate by about 1%. THE Representative Agent Paradigm with identical agents fails to take into ac- count the speculative behavior of different agents in the economy. Under this paradigm, aggregate measures of fundamentals are sufficient to measure the risks faced by agents. Given the smoothness of these aggregate variables, this paradigm requires individuals to be implausibly highly risk-averse to match the observed risk premium on stocks (as first noted in the seminal paper by Mehra and Prescott (1985)). Moreover, it implies that agents assign very low values to safe assets, that is, they require a high riskless rate to be induced to clear bond markets. An alternative viewpoint is that individuals process new information and decide on their trades using competing models of economic fundamentals. In contrast to the identica",

    "abstract": "Traders’ strategies and market outcomes in a limit order book environment. We ﬁnd that order strategies are greatly affected by allowing hidden liquidity, with traders substituting nondisplayed for displayed shares and changing the aggressiveness of their trading. As traders adapt their behavior to the different opacity regimes, how- ever, most aggregate market outcomes (such as liquidity and informational efﬁciency) are not affected as much. We also ﬁnd that opacity appears to increase the proﬁts of informed traders but only when their private information is very valuable. Hidden liquidity is now a standard feature of trading in equity markets. Virtu- ally all exchanges allow traders to “hide” all or a portion of their orders on the book, resulting in market liquidity having both a displayed and a nondisplayed component. Although nondisplayed orders generally lose priority to displayed orders at a given price, the invisibility of these orders can be valuable for a variety of trading strategies. With orders hidden, however, market partici- pants have only incomplete knowledge as to the overall depth in the market. Moreover, the ability to put hidden orders inside the displayed spread means that even the best prevailing prices are not observable. This evolution to “dark trading” in exchange markets, where orders are not publicly displayed prior to execution, has gained momentum in recent years, driven in part by the rise of crossing networks (which also allow traders to hide t",

    "abstract": "We study the consequences of, and potential policy responses to, high-frequency trad- ing (HFT) via the tradeoff between liquidity and information production. Faster speeds facilitate HFT, with consequences for this tradeoff: Information production decreases because informed traders have less time to trade before HFTs react, but liquidity (measured by the bid-ask spread) improves because informational asymme- tries decline. HFT also pushes outcomes inside the frontier of this tradeoff. However, outcomes can be restored to the frontier by replacing the limit order book with one of two alternative mechanisms: delaying all orders except cancellations or implementing frequent batch auctions. Financial Markets Have Been Transformed by faster speeds in recent years. For example, the BYX exchange slashed its order processing time sevenfold, from 445μs in 2009 to 64μs in 2018.1 Likewise, the round-trip communication time between Nasdaq and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has nearly halved, from over 14.5 ms in 2010 to 7.9 ms today.2 our advisors Timothy Bresnahan, Gabriel Carroll, Jonathan Levin, Paul Milgrom, and Monika Piazzesi.

The alternative is HFTs trading with the wind, that is, in the same direction. We ﬁnd that HFTs initially lean against these orders but eventually change direction and take positions in the same direction for the most informed institutional orders.

    "abstract": "Incentive fees for money managers are frequently accompanied by high-water mark provisions that condition the payment of the performance fee upon exceeding the previously achieved maximum share value. In this paper, we show that hedge fund performance fees are valuable to money managers, and conversely, represent a claim on a significant proportion of investor wealth. The high-water mark provisions in these contracts limit the value of the performance fees. We provide a closed-form solution to the cost of the high-water mark contract under certain conditions. Our results provide a framework for valuation of a hedge fund management company. THE Growth OF THE Hedge Fund Industry over the past decade has brought an un- usual form of performance contract to the attention of the investment commu- nity.1 Hedge fund managers typically receive a fraction of the fund's return each year in excess of the high-water mark. The high-water mark for each investor is the maximum share value since his or her investment in the fund.2 These perfor- mance fees generally range from 15 percent to 25 percent of the new profits earned each year. In addition, managers also charge a regular annual fee of one percent to two percent of portfolio assets. For example, George Soros' Quantum Fund charges investors an annual fee of one percent of net asset value with a high-water mark based performance fee of 20 percent of net new profits earned annually. As a result, the Quantum Fund returned 49 percent (pre",

    "abstract": "We study the portfolio choice of hedge fund managers who are compensated by high- water mark contracts. We find that even risk-neutral managers do not place un- bounded weights on risky assets, despite option-like contracts. Instead, they place a constant fraction of funds in a mean-variance efficient portfolio and the rest in the riskless asset, acting as would constant relative risk aversion (crra) investors. This result is a direct consequence of the in(de)finite horizon of the contract. We show that the risk-seeking incentives of option-like contracts rely on combining finite horizons and convex compensation schemes rather than on convexity alone. A Popular Intuition IN Financial Economics is that contracts with convex payoffs can potentially increase the incentive to take risks, that is, can induce risk- shifting.1 According to this commonly held view, if a manager is rewarded for gains but not punished for losses, that manager will only gain from increasing underlying volatility. In this paper, we ask the question: How are the incentives of the manager affected if the horizon of the compensation contract is infinite or indefinite? Our interest in this question is both practical and theoretical. At a practi- cal level, we want to understand the incentives provided by certain contracts called high-water mark contracts, which have proliferated with the growth of the hedge fund industry.

    "title": "Higher Order Effects in Asset Pricing Models",
    "abstract": "This paper shows that the latest generation of asset pricing models with long-run risk exhibit economically signiﬁcant nonlinearities, and thus the ubiquitous Campbell- Shiller log-linearization can generate large numerical errors. These errors translate in turn to considerable errors in the model predictions, for example, for the mag- nitude of the equity premium or return predictability. We demonstrate that these nonlinearities arise from the presence of multiple highly persistent processes, which cause the exogenous states to attain values far away from their long-run means with nonnegligible probability. These extreme values have a signiﬁcant impact on asset price dynamics. Bansal AND Yaron (2004) Introduce TWO important innovations to the as- set pricing literature. In particular, they put forward an economic mechanism based on long-run risk to explain many empirical asset pricing facts, and they demonstrate that the Campbell-Shiller (1988) log-linearization technique pro- vides a simple method for analyzing such models. These two contributions together have served as the foundation for a large literature on the ability of long-run risk to solve empirical puzzles. By necessity, log-linearization neglects higher order effects in asset pricing models. In this paper, we ask whether these effects matter for the latest generation of long-run risk models. We show that they do. More speciﬁcally, we demonstrate that, for many economically plau- sible choices of parameters and ex",

To isolate the role of collateral constraints from that of wealth effects, I exploit the fully anticipated expiration of resale price controls on owner- occupied housing in Montgomery County, Maryland. I estimate a marginal propensity to borrow out of housing collateral that ranges between $0.04 and $0.13 and is corre- lated with homeowners’ initial leverage. Additional analysis of residential investment and ex-post loan performance indicates that some of the extracted funds generated new expenditures. These results suggest a potentially important role for collateral constraints in driving household expenditures. Large Fluctuations IN Household Debt have become a common feature of business cycles worldwide (Jord `a, Schularick, and Taylor ( 2014), Mian, Suﬁ, and Verner ( 2015)).

    "abstract": "This paper examines whether hostile takeovers can be distinguished from friendly takeovers, empirically, based on accounting and stock performance data. Much has been made of this distinction in both the popular and the academic literature, where gains from hostile takeovers result from replacing incumbent managers and gains from friendly takeovers result from strategic synergies. Alternatively, hos- tility could reflect strategic choices made by the bidder or the target. Empirical tests show that most deals described as hostile in the press are not distinguishable from friendly deals in economic terms, except that hostile transactions involve publicity as part of the bargaining process. THE Perception OF Hostility in American takeovers has had important con- notations in both the popular and the academic literature. Unwelcome bids are often perceived to threaten at least some of the stakeholders in target corporations, leading to extensive defensive reactions by the management of the target firm. In contrast, friendly takeovers are often seen to create synergies that make both the bidder and the target firm better off (see, for example, M0rck, Shleifer, and Vishny (1988, 1989)). The distinction between hostile and friendly takeovers is also important if removing an inefficient target management team creates the gains from hostile takeovers. Manne (1965) refers to this as part of the market for cor- porate control. Several papers have shown that management turnover in- crease",

    "abstract": "We use a labor-search model to explain why the worst employment slumps often follow expansions of household debt. We ﬁnd that households protected by limited liability suffer from a household-debt-overhang problem that leads them to require high wages to work. Firms respond by posting high wages but few vacancies. Thisvacancy posting effect implies that high household debt leads to high unemployment. Even though households borrow from banks via bilaterally optimal contracts, the equilibrium level of household debt is inefﬁciently high due to ahousehold-debt externality. We analyze the role that a ﬁnancial regulator can play in mitigating this externality. Personal Bankruptcy IS Pervasive IN THEUnited States—about one in 10 Amer- icans will declare bankruptcy in his lifetime.1 Under the U.S. Bankruptcy code, households are protected by limited liability. That is, they can discharge their debt and still keep a substantial amount of their assets. Such limited-liability protection distorts the incentives of indebted households, just as it distorts the incentives of indebted ﬁrms in corporate ﬁnance. In this paper, we investi- gate how this distortion can affect the labor market. In particular, we ask the following questions. How does limited-liability debt distort household labor supply, and how does this affect aggregate employment in equilibrium? Further, do households take Ecgi.

    "title": "Household Finance",
    "abstract": "The study of household finance is challenging because household behavior is difficult to measure, and households face constraints not captured by textbook models. Evi- dence on participation, diversification, and mortgage refinancing suggests that many households invest effectively, but a minority make significant mistakes. This minor- ity appears to be poorer and less well educated than the majority of more successful investors. There is some evidence that households understand their own limitations and avoid financial strategies for which they feel unqualified. Some financial products involve a cross-subsidy from naive to sophisticated households, and this can inhibit welfare-improving financial innovation. A Presidential Address IS A Privileged Opportunity to ask questions without an- swering them, and to suggest answers without proving them. I use this op- portunity to explore a field, household finance, that has attracted much recent interest but still lacks definition and status within our profession. Teaching of asset pricing and corporate finance. Economists in the former field ask how asset prices are determined in capital markets and how average asset returns reflect risk. Economists in the latter field ask how business enterprises use financial instruments to further the interests of their owners, and in particular to resolve agency problems. By analogy with corporate finance, household finance asks how households use financial instruments to attain their objective",

    "title": "Household Liquidity Constraints and Labor",
    "abstract": "We study the causal effect of liquidity constraints on individual labor market out- comes by exploiting the 1992 mortgage reform in Denmark, which for the ﬁrst time allowed homeowners to borrow against housing equity for nonhousing purposes. Fol- lowing the reform, liquidity-constrained homeowners increased debt levels and had higher earnings growth and lower employment rates. The option to borrow against housing equity enabled liquidity-constrained individuals to move to high-wage jobs and invest in valuable human and physical capital. The results imply that relaxing household liquidity constraints during recessions can create better job matches, po- tentially increasing earnings and output in the longer run. A Significant Fraction OF Households are severely liquidity con- strained. In the United States, for example, approximately a quarter of house- holds are unable to come up with $2,000 to cope with an unexpected need (Lusardi, Schneider, and Tufano (2011)).1 This makes them very fragile to un- phasized the role of liquidity constraints in job search, but in the case of UI beneﬁts, the liquidity effect is accompanied by a moral hazard effect, lead- ing to an ambiguous effect on wages and efﬁciency (Hansen and Imrohoro˘glu (1992), Chetty (2008)).

    "abstract": "Mortgage reﬁnancing activity associated with extraction of home equity contains a strongly countercyclical component consistent with household demand for liquidity. We estimate a structural model of liquidity management featuring countercyclical idiosyncratic labor income uncertainty, long- and short-term mortgages, and realistic borrowing constraints. We empirically evaluate its predictions for households’ choices of leverage, liquid assets, and mortgage reﬁnancing using microlevel data. Taking the observed historical paths of house prices, aggregate income, and interest rates as given, the model accounts for many salient features in the evolution of balance sheets and consumption in the cross-section of households over 2001 to 2012. THE Origins OF THE RECENTﬁnancial crisis and the severity of the Great Reces- sion are often attributed to the increase in consumer indebtedness during the period of house price run-up in mid-2000s and the subsequent deterioration of household balance sheets with the sharp decline in house prices (see, e.g., Dynan (2012), Mian, Rao, and Suﬁ (2013)). There is less consensus, however, about the structural forces driving the borrowing boom and the subsequent consumption slump.1 In particular, the growth of household leverage and con- sumption expenditures ﬁnanced with extracted home equity over the house price boom as documented by Mian and Suﬁ (2011) arequalitatively consistent and Nber.

    "title": "Housing Collateral and Entrepreneurship",
    "abstract": "We show that collateral constraints restrict ﬁrm entry and postentry growth, using French administrative data and cross-sectional variation in local house-price appreci- ation as shocks to collateral values. We control for local demand shocks by comparing treated homeowners to controls in the same region that do not experience collat- eral shocks: renters and homeowners with an outstanding mortgage, who (in France) cannot take out a second mortgage. In both comparisons, an increase in collateral value leads to a higher probability of becoming an entrepreneur. Conditional on en- try, treated entrepreneurs use more debt, start larger ﬁrms, and remain larger in the long run. This Paper Provides EVIDENCEthat entrepreneurs face credit constraints that restrict ﬁrm creation and postentry growth, even over the long run. Exist- ing literature documents a strong correlation between entrepreneurial wealth and the propensity to start or keep a business (Evans and Jovanovic (1989), Evans and Leighton (1989), Holtz-Eakin, Joulfaian, and Rosen (1993)). How- ever, whether such a correlation constitutes evidence of ﬁnancial constraints is an open question. For example, individuals who experience a wealth increase through inheritance are more likely to start a ﬁrm, but they may also have greater access to business opportunities for reasons unrelated to their wealth (Hurst and Lusardi (2004)).

    "title": "Housing Collateral, Consumption Insurance,",
    "abstract": "In a model with housing collateral, the ratio of housing wealth to human wealth shifts the conditional distribution of asset prices and consumption growth. A decrease in house prices reduces the collateral value of housing, increases household exposure to idiosyncratic risk, and increases the conditional market price of risk. Using aggregate data for the United States, we find that a decrease in the ratio of housing wealth to human wealth predicts higher returns on stocks. Conditional on this ratio, the covariance of returns with aggregate risk factors explains 80% of the cross-sectional variation in annual size and book-to-market portfolio returns. House Price Fluctuations Play AN Important Role in explaining the time-series and the cross-sectional variation in asset returns. Given the magnitude of the housing market, this is unsurprising. This paper shows that the way in which housing affects asset returns is through the role of housing as a collateral asset. We identify a novel collateral channel that transmits shocks in the housing market to risk premia. In a model with collateralized borrowing and lending, the ratio of housing wealth to human wealth, the housing collateral ratio, changes the conditional distribution of consumption growth across households. When the collateral ratio is low, the dispersion of consumption growth across house- holds is more sensitive to aggregate consumption growth shocks, and this raises the market price of aggregate risk.

We provide descrip- tive statistics on the trading revenues from such activities and on the associated Value-at-Risk (VaR) forecasts internally estimated by banks. For a sample of large bank holding companies, we evaluate the performance of banks' trading risk mod- els by examining the statistical accuracy of the VaR forecasts. Although a substan- tial literature has examined the statistical and economic meaning of Value-at-Risk models, this article is the first to provide a detailed analysis of the performance of models actually in use. IN Recent Years, THE Trading Accounts at large commercial banks have grown rapidly and become progressively more complex. To a large extent, this re- flects the sharp growth in the over-the-counter derivatives markets, in which commercial banks are the principal dealers. To manage market risks, major trading institutions have developed large scale risk measurement models. While approaches may differ, all such models measure and aggregate mar- ket risks in current positions at a highly detailed level. The models employ a standard risk metric, Value-at-Risk (VaR), which is a lower tail percentile for the distribution of profit and loss (P&L). VaR models have been sanc- tioned for determining market risk capital requirements for large banks by U.S. And international banking authorities through the 1996 Mar",

    "abstract": "As measured by the number of bidders that publicly attempt to acquire a target, the takeover arena in the 1990s appears noncompetitive. However, we provide novel data on the pre-public, private takeover process that indicates that public takeover activity is only the tip of the iceberg of actual takeover competition during the 1990s. We show a highly competitive market where half of the targets are auctioned among multiple bidders, while the remainder negotiate with a single bidder. In event study analysis, we find that the wealth effects for target shareholders are comparable in auctions and negotiations. THE Traditional Measure OF Competition in a corporate takeover is the number of bidders that publicly attempt to acquire the target. Using this measure, many notable researchers report that the takeover market during the 1990s was not very competitive. For instance, Andrade, Mitchell, and Stafford (2001) describe the prototypical takeover in the 1990s as a friendly transaction with only one bidding firm. Similarly, Schwert (2000) reports that the 1990s witnessed far fewer public takeover auctions than previous time periods, and argues that this was due to the growing use of poison pills and the imposition of state an- (2004), Moeller (2005), and Wulf (2004) suggests that target managers used their growing bargaining power in the 1990s to negotiate sweet deals for them- selves at the expense of their shareholders.

    "title": "How Big Are the Tax Benefits of Debt?",
    "abstract": "I integrate under firm-specific benefit functions to estimate that the capitalized tax benefit of debt equals 9.7 percent of firm value (or as low as 4.3 percent, net of personal taxes). The typical firm could double tax benefits by issuing debt until the marginal tax benefit begins to decline. I infer how aggressively a firm uses debt by observing the shape of its tax benefit function. Paradoxically, large, liquid, profit- able firms with low expected distress costs use debt conservatively. Product mar- ket factors, growth options, low asset collateral, and planning for future expenditures lead to conservative debt usage. Conservative debt policy is persistent. Do THE TAX Benefits of debt affect corporate financing decisions? How much do they add to firm value? These questions have puzzled researchers since the work of Modigliani and Miller (1958, 1963). Recent evidence indicates that tax benefits are one of the factors that affect financing choice (e.g., MacKie-Mason (1990), Graham (1996a)), although opinion is not unanimous on which factors are most important or how they contribute to firm value (Shyam-Sunder and Myers (1998), Fama and French (1998)). Researchers face several problems when they investigate how tax incen- tives affect corporate financial policy and firm value. Chief among these problems is the difficulty of calculating corporate tax rates due to data prob- lems and the complexity of the tax code. Other challenges include quantify- ing the effects of interes",

    "title": "How Crashes Develop: Intradaily Volatility",
    "abstract": "This paper explores whether afﬁne models with volatility jumps estimated on in- tradaily S&P 500 futures data over 1983 to 2008 can capture major daily outliers such as the 1987 stock market crash. Intradaily jumps in futures prices are typi- cally small; self-exciting but short-lived volatility spikes capture intradaily and daily returns better. Multifactor models of the evolution of diffusive variance and jump intensities improve ﬁts substantially, including out-of-sample over 2009 to 2016. The models capture reasonably well the conditional distributions of daily returns and re- alized variance outliers, but underpredict realized variance inliers. I also examine option pricing implications. What IS A Crash?i NT H Ejump-diffusion model of Merton (1976), a crash is a rare event—a single adverse draw from a Poisson counter, with a vanishingly small probability of multiple adverse draws within a single day. While this model may be successful at capturing outliers in daily returns, it does not appear to capture the intradaily evolution of major market downturns. The 28% drop in the December 1987 S&P 500 futures price (23% drop in the S&P index) on Monday, October 19, 1987, from the preceding Friday’s closing level did not occur within ﬁve minutes, for instance; it took all day to achieve the full decline.

    "title": "How Credit Cycles across a Financial Crisis",
    "abstract": "We analyze the behavior of credit and output in ﬁnancial crises using data on credit spreads and credit growth. Crises are marked by a sharp rise in credit spreads, sig- naling sudden shifts in expectations. The severity of a crisis can be predicted by the extent of credit losses (spread increases) and ﬁnancial sector fragility (precrisis credit growth). This interaction is a key feature of crises. Postcrisis recessions are typically severe and prolonged. Notably, precrisis spreads tend to drop to low levels while credit growth accelerates, indicating that credit supply expansions often precede crises. The 2008 crisis aligns with these patterns. WE Characterize THE Dynamics OF credit markets and output across a ﬁnancial crisis cycle, contributing to a literature that examines the empirical links between credit and the macroeconomy. This literature has sought an- swers to two main questions: (i) What is the aftermath of a ﬁnancial crisis, and, in particular, what factors lead to a more protracted postcrisis recession?

Using administrative account data and household surveys, we ﬁnd that beneﬁciaries accumulated a savings stock equal to 2% of annual income after two years with the card. The increase in formal savings represents an increase in overall savings, ﬁnanced by a reduction in current consumption. There are two mechanisms. First, debit cards reduce transaction costs of accessing money. Second, they reduce monitoring costs, which led beneﬁciaries to check their account balances frequently and build trust in the bank.

    "abstract": "We provide empirical evidence that stock market crises are spread globally through asset holdings of international investors. By separating emerging market stocks into two categories, namely, those that are eligible for purchase by foreigners (accessible) and those that are not (inaccessible), we estimate and compare the degree to which accessible and inaccessible stock index returns co-move with crisis country index re- turns. Our results show greater co-movement during high volatility periods, especially for accessible stock index returns, suggesting that crises spread through the asset holdings of international investors rather than through changes in fundamentals. THE Past Decade WAS Marked BY Several stock market crises in developing economies; in particular, the Mexican peso collapse in 1994, the Asian crisis in 1997, and the Russian default in 1998. One striking feature common to these crises is how an initially country-specific event seemed to transmit rapidly to markets around the globe. These events have prompted a surge of empirical and theoretical interest in “contagion” and the determinants of a country’s vul- nerability to crises that originate elsewhere. In the empirical literature, Karolyi and Stulz (1996) and Connolly and Wang (2003) find that macroeconomic announcements and other public information do not affect co-movements of Japanese and American stock markets.

    "abstract": "We investigate the factors influencing the selection of stocks for option listing. Exchanges tend to list options on stocks with high trading volume, volatility, and market capitalization, but the relative effect of these factors has changed over time as markets have evolved. We observe a shift from volume toward volatility after the mora- torium on new listings ended in 1980. Using control sample methodology designed to correct for the endogeneity of option listing, we find no evidence that volatility de- clines with option introduction, in contrast to previous studies that do not use control samples. Beginning With A Handful of options listed on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (cboe) in April 1973, the exchange-traded option market has since matured into a thriving industry. In the United States, options trade on five exchanges, with contracts on stock indices, exchange-traded funds, currencies, interest rates, and over 3,000 stocks. Total equities options volume traded on U.S. Exchanges has risen from 5.7 million contracts in 1974 to over 722 million contracts in 2001 (Options Clearing Corporation, http://www.optionsclearing.

Following P&C divisions’ losses, life divisions change prices in a manner that can generate more immediate ﬁnancial resources: premiums fall (rise) for life policies that immediately increase (decrease) insurers’ ﬁnancial resources. Premiums change more in groups that are more constrained. Life divisions increase transfers to P&C divisions, suggesting P&C divisions’ shocks are transmitted to life divisions. Results hold when instrumenting for P&C divisions’ losses with exposure to unusual weather damages, implying that the effects are causal. HOW Frictions IN Financial Markets affect ﬁrms’ real activities is a fun- damentally important question in ﬁnance. These frictions can cause ﬁrms to be ﬁnancially constrained.

This paper provides evidence velopment (R&D)-intensive ﬁrms is fewer ﬁnancing constraints on ﬁrms’ ability to access growth options. I provide evidence for this effect by studying how persistent shocks to the value of ﬁrms’ tangible assets (real estate) affect their subsequent equity volatility. The analysis addresses concerns about the identiﬁcation of these balance sheet effects and shows that these effects are consistent with broader patterns on the equity volatility of R&D-intensive ﬁrms. Firms Experience Substantial Volatility IN their equity value. Though most ﬁrm equity volatility is idiosyncratic, it matters for several reasons. For ex- ample, idiosyncratic volatility is important for determining portfolio alloca- tions (Campbell et al.

It also matters for ﬁrm value in the presence of frictions such as ﬁnancing constraints, for large share- holders who might play an important corporate governance role (Shleifer and Vishny (1986)), for managers who hold equity stakes due to compensation policies, and for arbitrageurs who trade to exploit the mispricing of individ- ual stocks (Shleifer and Vishny (1997)).1 In addition, equity volatility plays a central role in a large literature on corporate risk management policies, Harry DeAn",

We ﬁnd that, given average grant levels during our sample period, a 10% increase in new options granted leads to a 2.8% to 4.2% increase in equity volatility. This increase in risk is driven largely by increased leverage. Performance-sensitive PAY FOR EXECUTIVEShas surged over the last 30 years. Much of this surge has been in the form of stock options, which became the largest component of executive compensation in the 1990s, accounting for ap- proximately 50% of the total compensation of S&P 500 CEOs by the end of the decade. Following changes in the accounting treatment of options in 2005, the use of options declined. Still, options remain a major component of CEO pay, accounting for over 20% of total pay (Murphy (2013)). Moreover, Bettis et al. (2012) ﬁnd that many ﬁrms have substituted from option grants toward performance-vesting stock grants, which have option-like payoffs. Similar to an option, a performance-vesting share provides zero payoff below some perfor- mance threshold and increasing payoffs above the threshold.

    "abstract": "Credit supply expansion can affect an economy by increasing productive capacity or by boosting household demand. In this study, we develop a test to determine if the household demand channel is present, and we implement the test using both a natural experiment in the United States in the 1980s and an international panel of 56 countries over the last several decades. Consistent with the importance of the household demand channel, we ﬁnd that credit supply expansion boosts nontradable sector employment and the price of nontradable goods, with limited effects on tradable sector employment. Such credit expansions amplify the business cycle and lead to more severe recessions. There IS Increasing Recognition THATcredit supply expansions and business cycles are closely connected.1 However, less is known about the exact channel through which credit supply expansion affects the business cycle. This study outlines two potential channels. First, a credit expansion may allow constrained ﬁrms to borrow and grow, thereby increasing the economy’sproductive capacity. Second, a credit expansion may allow households to borrow and consume more, Public Policy and Finance at Princeton, and the Initiative on Global Markets at Chicago Booth.

    "abstract": "We identify a specific channel (debt covenants) and the corresponding mechanism (transfer of control rights) through which financing frictions impact corporate invest- ment. Using a regression discontinuity design, we show that capital investment de- clines sharply following a financial covenant violation, when creditors use the threat of accelerating the loan to intervene in management. Further, the reduction in in- vestment is concentrated in situations in which agency and information problems are relatively more severe, highlighting how the state-contingent allocation of control rights can help mitigate investment distortions arising from financing frictions. Ing and investment are related, it has been much less clear on how financing and investment are related (Stein (2003)). In other words, the precise mech- anisms behind this relationship are largely unknown. Further, the extent to which these mechanisms mitigate or exacerbate investment distortions arising from underlying financing frictions is largely unknown as well. The goal of this paper is to address these issues by identifying a specific mechanism through which financing frictions affect investment and by quantifying the impact of this mechanism on the distribution of investment. To this end, we examine the impact of debt covenant violations on corporate investment. We focus our attention on violations of financial covenants, such as those requiring the maintenance of a minimum net worth or current ratio. Violati",

    "abstract": "Household investment mistakes are an important concern for researchers and poli- cymakers alike. Portfolio underdiversiﬁcation ranks among those mistakes that are potentially most costly. However, its roots and empirical importance are poorly under- stood. I estimate quantitatively meaningful diversiﬁcation statistics and investigate their relationship with key variables. Nearly all households that score high on ﬁnan- cial literacy or rely on professionals or private contacts for advice achieve reasonable investment outcomes. Compared to these groups, households with below-median ﬁ- nancial literacy that trust their own decision-making capabilities lose an expected 50 bps on average. All group differences stem from the top of the loss distribution. Economic Theory Predicts THAThouseholds will hold their risky assets in the form of a well-diversiﬁed portfolio. The extent to which this prediction holds true has important implications for the regulation of consumer ﬁnancial prod- ucts, the design of retirement savings plans, and the distribution of consumer well-being in general. It is especially signiﬁcant to know the patterns of under- diversiﬁcation.

    "abstract": "Using a simple dynamic asset pricing model, this paper investigates the relation- ship between the precision of public information about economic growth and stock market returns. After fully characterizing expected returns and conditional vola- tility, I show that (i) higher precision of signals tends to increase the risk premium, (ii) when signals are imprecise the equity premium is bounded above indepen- dently of investors' risk aversion, (iii) return volatility is U-shaped with respect to investors' risk aversion, and (iv) the relationship between conditional expected re- turns and conditional variance is ambiguous. IN Modern Financial Markets, investors are flooded with a variety of infor- mation: corporations' earnings reports, revisions of macroeconomic indexes, policymakers' statements, and political news. These pieces of information are processed by investors to update their projections of the economy's fu- ture growth rate, inflation rate, and interest rate. In turn, these changes in investors' expectations affect stock market prices. However, even though it is clear that asset prices react to new information, several questions arise re- garding the relationship between the quality of information that investors receive and asset returns. For example, what kind of effect does a noisy signal on the \"health\" of the economy have on stock market prices? If infor- mation is noisy, is there a risk premium?

    "title": "How Does Size Affect Mutual Fund Behavior?",
    "abstract": "If actively managed mutual funds suffer from diminishing returns to scale, funds should alter investment behavior as assets under management increase. Although asset growth has little effect on the behavior of the typical fund, we find that large funds and small-cap funds diversify their portfolios in response to growth. Greater diversification, especially for small-cap funds, is associated with better performance. Fund family growth is related to the introduction of new funds that hold different stocks from their existing siblings. Funds with many siblings diversify less rapidly as they grow, suggesting that the fund family may influence a fund’s portfolio strategy. THE Average Equity Mutual Fund does not outperform the stock market and rel- atively few actively managed equity funds can persistently outperform passive investment strategies.1 The absence of superior performance for the average fund combined with the lack of performance persistence appears to suggest a lack of managerial skill. In the absence of skill, why do actively managed funds manage so much money? Berk and Green (2004) indicates that diminishing re- turns to scale can reconcile the lack of average outperformance and performance persistence with the existence of managerial skill. In their model, money flows to a fund until the marginal dollar can no longer be invested advantageously. In this paper, we investigate the effect of asset growth on aspects of fund in- vestment behavior, to identify more precise",

    "abstract": "The events following Lehman’s failure in 2008 and the current turmoil emanating from Europe highlight the structural vulnerabilities of short-term credit markets and the role of central banks as back-stop liquidity providers. The Federal Reserve’s re- sponse to ﬁnancial disruptions in the United States importantly included the creation of liquidity facilities. Using a differences-in-differences approach, we evaluate one of the most unusual of these interventions—the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility. We ﬁnd that this facility helped stabilize as- set outﬂows from money market funds and reduced asset-backed commercial paper yields signiﬁcantly. THE Events That Followed the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 helped deﬁne the ﬁnancial crisis of 2007 to 2009 as the most severe since the Great Depression. Spreads between Libor and overnight in- dex swap (OIS) rates rose to unprecedented levels as short-term credit mar- kets came under pressure, and credit default swap (CDS) spreads for many large ﬁnancial institutions soared (Brunnermeier (2009), Taylor and Williams (2009)). As institutions became unwilling to lend to each other, the ﬂow of credit in ﬁnancial markets was severely disrupted. The current European sovereign debt crisis has renewed the pressures on short-term credit markets, and CDS spreads on many large ﬁnancial institutions have risen to similar or higher levels than those in the fall of 2008. ∗Duygan-Bump and Sua",

The model captures many aspects of the joint dynamics of CDX and SPX options.

    "abstract": "The literature documents a convex relation between past returns and fund flows of mutual funds. We show this to be consistent with fund incentives, be- cause funds discard exactly those strategies which underperform. Past re- turns tell less about the future performance of funds which discard, so flows are less sensitive to them when they are poor. Our model predicts that strategy changes only occur after bad performance, and that bad performers who change strategy have dollar flow and future performance that are less sensi- tive to current performance than those that do not. Empirical tests support both predictions. Investors WHO Condition Open-end Mutual Fund allocations on past performance appear to be relatively indifferent among bad returns. Several recent papers (e.g., Sirri and Tufano (1998), Ippolito (1992)) show net new investment to be much less sensitive to past returns in the region of bad returns, as if all returns below some threshold send roughly the same signal to investors about future prospects. Brown, Harlow, and Starks (1996) and Chevalier and Ellison (1997) interpret this pattern as the fund's implicit compensation scheme and ask whether this induces the asset substitution associated with convex compensation; our goal here is to determine why the pattern occurs in the first place and provide empirical support for our explanation.

    "title": "How Laws and Institutions Shape Financial",
    "abstract": "Legal and institutional differences shape the ownership and terms of bank loans across the world. We show that under strong creditor protection, loans have more concentrated ownership, longer maturities, and lower interest rates. Moreover, the impact of creditor rights on loans depends on borrower characteristics such as the size and tangibility of assets. Foreign banks appear especially sensitive to the legal and institutional environment, with their ownership declining relative to domestic banks as creditor protection falls. Our multidimensional empirical model paints a more complete picture of how financial contracts respond to the legal and institutional environment than existing studies. Banks ARE THE Dominant Suppliers of external finance in most economies across the world, with foreign lenders playing an increasingly important role (Demirg ¨uc ¸-Kunt and Levine (2001)). When lending to a company in an emerg- ing economy, a bank must assess not only the credit quality of the borrower but also the risks due to weak laws or institutions. This paper estimates how laws and institutions affect the price and nonprice terms, as well as the ownership, of bank loans around the globe. Our results support the logic underlying the law and finance literature, pioneered by La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny (1997, 1998; Llsv hereafter), that some environments are more conducive to writing and enforcing financial contracts than others, and that better contracting leads t",

Minority applicants tend to have lower credit scores and higher leverage, and are less likely to receive algorithmic approval from race-blind automated underwriting systems (AUS). Observable applicant-risk factors explain most of the racial disparities in lender denials. Further, exploiting the AUS data, we show there are risk factors we do not observe, and these factors at least partially ex- plain the residual 1 to 2 percentage point denial gaps. We conclude that differential treatment plays a more limited role in generating denial disparities than previous American Families USE Mortgages TO Purchase their homes, to lower their housing costs when interest rates decline, and to tap into home equity for a variety of reasons including investments in human capital and small busi- nesses. But not all families can easily get a mortgage. In particular, access to mortgage credit differs sharply by race and ethnicity, which may contribute to the wide racial and ethnic gaps in homeownership and wealth (e.g., Bhutta et al. (2020)). For example, in 2018 and 2019, about 18% of Black mortgage ap- plicants were denied by lenders, more than twice the rate of White applicants.

    "abstract": "There is a worldwide trend towards defined contribution savings plans, where in- vestors are often able to select their own portfolios. How much is this freedom of choice worth? We present retirement investors with information about the distri- bution of outcomes they could expect to obtain from the portfolios they picked for themselves, and the same information for the median portfolio selected by their peers. A majority of our survey participants actually prefer the median portfolio to the one they picked for themselves. We investigate various explanations for these findings and offer some evidence that the results are partly attributable to the fact that investors do not have well-defined preferences. A major trend in defined contribution savings plans is the expansion in the choices available to participants. A decade ago most plans offered very few choices, often just a money market fund, a bond fund, a stock fund, and stock in the company sponsoring the plan. Now the plans offer an average of 11 funds (Hewitt Associates (1999)), and some plan participants are even permitted to pick individual securities through a direct brokerage account. And, in Sweden, a recent social security reform giving workers the right to direct 2.5 percent of their salary to individual accounts offered a stunning 450 different funds to choose from. Do investors benefit from this ability to choose portfolios for themselves? It is a basic principle of economic theory that expanding the choice set",

    "abstract": "This paper examines the capital structure implications of market timing. I isolate tim- ing attempts in a single major financing event, the initial public offering, by identify- ing market timers as firms that go public in hot issue markets. I find that hot-market IPO firms issue substantially more equity, and lower their leverage ratios by more, than cold-market firms do. However, immediately after going public, hot-market firms increase their leverage ratios by issuing more debt and less equity relative to cold- market firms. At the end of the second year following the IPO, the impact of market timing on leverage completely vanishes. Equity Market Timing IS ONE OF THE Primary Factors that shape corporate fi- nancing decisions. A large body of work documents the tendency of firms to issue equity when the cost of equity capital appears to be temporarily low. The evidence is convincing. Studies on market valuations around equity issues are complemented by other findings such as the long-run underperformance of is- suers and by survey results of managers (see Sec. I for a detailed review of prior evidence on market timing). While the collective evidence makes a strong case for the presence of market timing attempts, quantifying their impact on financing activity is difficult. Most direct tests of market timing are based on the positive relationship between firms’ market valuations and their equity issues. However, a host of other factors that affect financing policy are likely",

    "abstract": "We use market data on corporate bonds and equities to measure the value of U.S. Corporate assets and their payouts to investors. In contrast to equity dividends, total corporate payouts are highly volatile, turn negative when corporations raise capital, and are acyclical. At the same time, corporate asset returns are similar to returns on equity , and both are exposed to ﬂuctuations in economic growth. To reconcile this evidence, we argue that acyclical but volatile net repurchases mask the exposure of total payouts’ cash components to economic growth risks. We develop an asset pricing framework to quantitatively illustrate this economic channel. THE KEY Question IN Financial Economics concerns the trade-off between risk and return in ﬁnancial markets. An economic analysis of risk and return has been a subject of the large body of macroﬁnance literature ranging from the models of business-cycle risk of Mehra and Prescott (1985) and habits of Camp- bell and Cochrane (1999) to the long-run risks of Bansal and Yaron (2004)a n d rare disasters of Rietz (1988) and Barro (2006).

    "abstract": "I analyze the sensitivity of a firm's investment to its own cash flow in the bench- mark case where financing is frictionless. This sensitivity has been proposed as a measure of financing constraints in earlier studies. I find that the invest- ment-cash flow sensitivities that obtain in the frictionless benchmark are very similar, both in magnitude and in patterns they exhibit, to those ob- served in the data. In particular, the sensitivity is higher for firms with high growth rates and low dividend payout ratios. Tobin's q is shown to be a more noisy measure of near-term investment plans for these firms. Does A High Sensitivity of a firm's investment to its own cash flow indicate that zari, Hubbard, and Petersen (1988) (hereafter FHP), suggests that firms facing fi- nancing constraints should exhibit high investment-cash flow sensitivities, reflecting the wedge between the costs of external and internal funds. Empirical findings seem to give support to this hypothesis, since firms classified as con- strained on a priori criteria, such as size, dividend payout, or leverage, do have higher cash flow sensitivities, even after controlling for their investment opportu- nities by conditioning on Tobin's q. However, the reliability of these results criti- cally depends on whether q is a proper control for the investment opportunity set. If q performs worse for certain classes of firms, higher sensitivities may obtain for these firms simply because cash flow reflects information abo",

Analysts exhibit heterogeneous skill—some are high-type, and some are low-type. On average, the recommendation revisions of both types exhibit positive abnormal returns. The heterogeneity stems from differential ability to produce new information; all analysts can proﬁtably process news.

This follows both from the direct influence of more experienced VCs and from sorting in the market, which leads experienced VCs to invest in better companies. Sorting creates an endogeneity problem, but a structural model based on a two-sided matching model is able to exploit the characteristics of the other agents in the market to separately identify and estimate influence and sorting. Both effects are found to be significant, with sorting almost twice as important as influence for the difference in IPO rates.

    "abstract": "Leverage cross-sections more than a few years apart differ markedly, with similarities evaporating as the time between them lengthens. Many ﬁrms have high and low leverage at different times, but few keep debt-to-assets ratios consistently above 0.500. Capital structure stability is the exception, not the rule, occurs primarily at low leverage, and is virtually always temporary, with many ﬁrms abandoning low leverage during the post-war boom. Industry-median leverage varies widely over time. Target- leverage models that place little or no weight on maintaining a particular ratio do a good job replicating the substantial instability of the actual leverage cross-section. THE View That Corporate leverage is stable pervades the empirical capital structure literature, and has fostered a belief that the main puzzle facing re- searchers is to explain cross-ﬁrm variation in leverage. Lemmon, Roberts, and Zender (2008, LRZ) ﬁnd highly signiﬁcant ﬁrm ﬁxed effects in panel leverage regressions, and conclude that ﬁrms with high (low) leverage tend to remain as such for two decades and longer, and that time-varying determinants are un- likely explanations for capital structure heterogeneity. Frank and Goyal (2008, p. 156) report that aggregate leverage stays in a narrow band over long hori- zons, cite LRZ for ﬁrm-level stability evidence, and conclude that “a satisfac- tory theory must account for why ﬁrms keep leverage stationary.” Parsons and Titman (2008) and Graham and Leary (2011) hi",

    "title": "How Wise Are Crowds? Insights from Retail",
    "abstract": "We analyze the role of retail investors in stock pricing using a database uniquely suited for this purpose. The data allow us to address selection bias concerns and to separately examine aggressive (market) and passive (limit) orders. Both aggressive and passive net buying positively predict ﬁrms’ monthly stock returns with no evi- dence of return reversal. Only aggressive orders correctly predict ﬁrm news, including earnings surprises, suggesting they convey novel cash ﬂow information. Only passive net buying follows negative returns, consistent with traders providing liquidity and beneﬁting from the reversal of transitory price movements. These actions contribute to market efﬁciency. What IS THE ROLEof self-directed retail traders in stock pricing? As managers of their own money, these investors are not subject to the agency problems, career concerns, or liquidity constraints that can hurt institutional managers’ performance (Lakonishok et al. (1991), Chevalier and Ellison (1999), and Coval and Stafford (2007)). Consequently, retail traders have clear incentives totrade on novel informationgleaned from geographic proximity to ﬁrms, relationships with employees, or insights into customer tastes.

    "title": "How and When Do Firms Adjust Their Capital",
    "abstract": "If firms adjust their capital structures toward targets, and if there are adverse se- lection costs associated with asymmetric information, how and when do firms adjust their capital structures? We suggest a financing needs-induced adjustment frame- work to examine the dynamic process by which firms adjust their capital structures. We find that most adjustments occur when firms have above-target (below-target) debt with a financial surplus (deficit). These results suggest that firms move toward the target capital structure when they face a financial deficit/surplus—but not in the manner hypothesized by the traditional pecking order theory. Previous Studies Have Expressed A Need for a unified framework that incor- porates elements of both pecking order and trade-off behavior. For example, unsatisfied with empirical evidence for both the pecking order theory and the traditional trade-off theory of capital structure, Fama and French (2005) conclude: Thus it is probably time to stop running empirical horse races between them as stand-alone stories for capital structure. Perhaps it is best to regard the two models as stable mates with each having elements of truth that help explain some aspects of financing decisions. (p. 580–581) Barclay and Smith (2005) also maintain: Although the pecking order theory is incapable of explaining the full array of financial policy choices, this does not mean that information costs are unimportant in corporate decision-making.

    "title": "How to Discount Cashflows with Time-Varying",
    "abstract": "While many studies document that the market risk premium is predictable and that betas are not constant, the dividend discount model ignores time-varying risk pre- miums and betas. We develop a model to consistently value cashflows with changing risk-free rates, predictable risk premiums, and conditional betas in the context of a conditional Capm. Practical valuation is accomplished with an analytic term struc- ture of discount rates, with different discount rates applied to expected cashflows at different horizons. Using constant discount rates can produce large misvaluations, which, in portfolio data, are mostly driven at short horizons by market risk premiums and at long horizons by time variation in risk-free rates and factor loadings. TO Determine AN Appropriate Discount Rate for valuing cashflows, a manager is confronted by three major problems: the market risk premium must be esti- mated, an appropriate risk-free rate must be chosen, and the beta of the project or company must be determined. All three of these inputs into a standard Capm are not constant. Furthermore, cashflows may covary with the risk premium, betas, or other predictive state variables. A standard Dividend Discount Model (DDM) cannot handle dynamic betas, risk premiums, or risk-free rates because in this valuation method, future expected cashflows are valued at constant discount rates. In this paper, we present an analytical methodology for valuing stochastic cashflows that are correlated with risk pr",

    "title": "Human Capital, Bankruptcy, and Capital",
    "abstract": "We derive the optimal labor contract for a levered ﬁrm in an economy with perfectly competitive capital and labor markets. Employees become entrenched under this contract and so face large human costs of bankruptcy. The ﬁrm’s optimal capital structure therefore depends on the trade-off between these human costs and the tax beneﬁts of debt. Optimal debt levels consistent with those observed in practice emerge without relying on frictions such as moral hazard or asymmetric information. Consistent with empirical evidence, persistent idiosyncratic differences in leverage across ﬁrms also result. In addition, wages should have explanatory power for ﬁrm leverage. Ever Since Modigliani AND Miller (1958) ﬁrst showed that capital structure is irrelevant in a frictionless economy, ﬁnancial economists have puzzled over exactly what frictions make the capital structure decision so important in re- ality. Over the years a consensus has emerged that at least two frictions are important: corporate income taxes and bankruptcy costs.

During a corporate bankruptcy, the press almost invariably focus on thehuman costs of bankruptcy.

    "title": "IPO Market Cycles:",
    "abstract": "Both IPO volume and average initial returns are highly autocorrelated. Further, more companies tend to go public following periods of high initial returns. How- ever, we find that the level of average initial returns at the time of filing contains no information about that company's eventual underpricing. Both the cycles in initial returns and the lead-lag relation between initial returns and IPO volume are predominantly driven by information learned during the registration period. More positive information results in higher initial returns and more companies filing IPOs soon thereafter. THE Phenomenon OF \"HOT IPO Markets\" has been recognized for a long time in the financial community. Jbbotson and Jaffe (1975) and Jbbotson, Sindelar, and Ritter (1988, 1994) show that there are pronounced cycles in the num- ber of new issues per month and also in the average initial return per month. Further, there appears to be a lead-lag relation between the two series. Fig- ure 1 shows monthly IPO volume and initial returns between 1960 and 2001. It seems that periods of high and rising initial returns tend to be followed by spurts of IPOs, which are themselves followed by periods of lower initial returns. For example, the high initial returns of early 1961 were followed by large numbers of companies going public in late 1961 and early 1962, and then by especially low average initial returns in late 1962. This pattern is repeated many times over the 41-year period. Paper was titled \"IPO Ma",

    "title": "IPO Pricing and Share Allocation:",
    "abstract": "Since an underwriter sets an IPO’s offer price without knowing its market value, investors can acquire information about its value and avoid overpriced deals (“lemon- dodge”). To mitigate this well-known risk, the bank enters into a repeat game with a coalition of investors who do not lemon-dodge in exchange for on-average under- priced shares. We (i) derive and test a quantitative IPO pricing rule (showing that tech IPOs were not excessively underpriced during the boom of the 1990s); and (ii) analyzing a unique multibank data set, find strong support for the conjecture that a bank preferentially allocates shares to its coalition. I do not approve of anything that tampers with natural ignorance. Igno- rance is like a delicate exotic fruit; touch it and the bloom is gone. Lady Bracknel (Gwendolen’s lead manager), The Importance of Being Earnest THE Marked Variation IN Average IPO Initial Returns (or underpricing) across time and across issuer types (e.g., tech firms and nontech firms) has thus far eluded explanation. Some theories seek to explain the fact of underpricing (most notably, the information extraction theory developed by Benveniste and Spindt (1989) and Benveniste and Wilhelm (1990)), but these theories cannot account for the variation in underpricing we observe. Other theories seek to identify factors that might increase or decrease underpricing relative to what it would otherwise have been (e.g., Loughran and Ritter (2002), Ljungqvist and Wilhelm (2003)), but thes",

    "title": "IPO Pricing in the Dot-cor Bubble",
    "abstract": "IPO underpricing reached astronomical levels during 1999 and 2000. We show that the regime shift in initial returns and other elements of pricing behavior can be at least partially accounted for by marked changes in pre-IPO owner- ship structure and insider selling behavior over the period, which reduced key decision makers' incentives to control underpricing. After controlling for these changes, the difference in underpricing between 1999 and 2000 and the preceding three years is much reduced. Our results suggest that it was firm characteristics that were unique during the \"dot-com bubble\" and that pricing behavior followed from incentives created by these characteristics. IN 1996, First-day Returns on initial public offerings (IPOs) averaged about 17 per- cent (median: 10 percent). In 1999, first-day returns averaged 73 percent (median: 40 percent) before tapering off to 58 percent (median: 30 percent) in 2000. Inter- net IPOs averaged a stunning 89 percent (median: 57 percent) during 1999 and 2000. These average returns dwarf those from earlier periods and are the most widely recognized feature of what is now commonly referred to as the \"dot-com bubble\".l Existing explanations for the initial return behavior of IPOs focus in large part on informational frictions that arise among the various parties to the transaction.2 Although it is conceivable that informational frictions became more severe during the dot-com bubble, it strains belief that even collectively this body of",

    "title": "IPO Pricing in “Hot” Market Conditions:",
    "abstract": "This paper explores the impact of investor sentiment on IPO pricing. Using a model in which the aftermarket price of IPO shares depends on the information about the intrinsic value of the company and investor sentiment, I show that IPOs can be over- priced and still exhibit positive initial return. A sample of recent French offerings with a fraction of the shares reserved for individual investors supports the predictions of the model. Individual investors’ demand is positively related to market conditions. Moreover, large individual investors’ demand leads to high IPO prices, large initial returns, and poor long-run performance. THE END OF THE Nineties was one of the hottest IPO markets ever. In this period, both the number of initial public offerings and the level of initial returns have reached unprecedented peaks. Ritter1 documents that in 1999 and 2000 only, 803 companies went public in the United States, raising about $123 billion and leaving about $62 billion on the table in the form of initial returns. Periodically, such periods of IPO euphoria occur. These so-called “hot issue” markets are characterized by high IPO volumes and high levels of initial return (see Ibbotson and Jaffe (1975) and Ritter (1984)), as well as positive serial correlation of IPO initial returns and correlation between recent levels of initial return and current IPO volume. Surprisingly, however, pre-IPO shareholders do not seem to be upset about leaving so much money on the table. Loughran and R",

    "title": "IPO Underpricing over the Very Long Run",
    "abstract": "A central measure of the efficiency of the Initial Public Offering (IPO) market is the extent to which issues are underpriced. We present new and comprehensive evidence covering British IPOs since World War I. During the period from 1917 to 1945, public offers were underpriced by an average of only 3.80%, as compared to 9.15% in the period from 1946 to 1986, and even more after the U.K. Stock market was deregulated in 1986. The post-WWII rise in underpricing cannot be attributed to changes in firm composition, and occurred in spite of improvements in regulation, disclosure, and the prestige of IPO underwriters. When Domino’s Pizza had an initial public offering (IPO) in the United King- dom in November 1999, its shares started trading at a 78% premium to the offer price. While there is anecdotal evidence of similarly large premia in previous hot markets, such as Ford Motor Company’s offering of its European subsidiary on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) in December 1928, which recorded an 87% first-day premium, it is not known whether IPO underpricing was com- monplace early in the last century. 1 As early as 1929, large initial premia of IPOs were highlighted byThe Economist (27 July), among others. However, the first empirical study of the pricing of IPOs on the London Stock Exchange was not published until 1967, when Merrett, Howe, and Newbould (1967) revealed underpricing of 17.2% on public offers between 1959 and 1963.

    "title": "Identification of Maximal Affine",
    "abstract": "Building on Duffie and Kan (1996), we propose a new representation of affine models in which the state vector comprises infinitesimal maturity yields and their quadratic covariations. Because these variables possess unambiguous economic interpretations, they generate a representation that is globally identiﬁable. Further, this representa- tion has more identifiable parameters than the “maximal” model of Dai and Singleton (2000). We implement this new representation for select three-factor models and find that model-independent estimates for the state vector can be estimated directly from yield curve data, which present advantages for the estimation and interpretation of multifactor models. THE Affine Class OF Term Structure Models as characterized by Duffie and Kan (DK, 1996) owes much of its popularity to its analytic tractability.1 In particular, the affine class possesses closed-form solutions for bond and bond option pricing (Duffie, Pan, and Singleton (2000)), efficient approximation methods for swap- tion pricing (Collin-Dufresne and Goldstein (2002b), Singleton and Umantsev (2002)), and closed-form moment conditions for empirical analysis (Singleton (2001), Pan (2002)). As such, it has generated much attention both theoretically and empirically.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the importance of idiosyncratic consumption risk for the cross- sectional variation in asset returns. We find that besides the rate of aggregate con- sumption growth, the cross-sectional variance of consumption growth is also a priced factor. This suggests that consumers are not fully insured against idiosyncratic con- sumption risk, and that asset returns reflect their attempts to reduce their exposure to this risk. The resulting two-factor consumption-based asset pricing model signifi- cantly outperforms the Capm, and its performance compares favorably with that of the Fama–French three-factor model. THE Validity OF THE Workhorse Consumption -based representative-agent model rests upon a number of assumptions, including the presence of markets that allow agents to perfectly insure themselves against idiosyncratic consumption risk. The only relevant pricing factor in the resulting standard multiperiod asset pricing model without frictions is the growth rate of aggregate consump- tion. The consumption-based asset pricing model (ccapm) that reflects this allocation, however, is not able to match important aspects of the distribution of historical asset returns, such as the risk premium on the market portfolio. Its performance in a cross-sectional context is weak; as a result this model has not succeeded in replacing alternative cross-sectional models such as the capital asset pricing model (capm) as the standard in the profession.

    "abstract": "This paper takes a new look at the predictability of stock market returns with risk measures. We find a significant positive relation between average stock variance (largely idiosyncratic) and the return on the market. In contrast, the variance of the market has no forecasting power for the market return. These relations persist after we control for macroeconomic variables known to forecast the stock market. The evidence is consistent with models of time- varying risk premia based on background risk and investor heterogeneity. Alternatively, our findings can be justified by the option value of equity in the capital structure of the firms. Mostasset Pricing Models, starting with Merton's (1973) Icapm, suggest a positive relation between risk and return for the aggregate stock market. There is a long empirical literature that has tried to establish the existence of such a tradeoff between risk and return for stock market indices.1 Unfortunately, the results have been inconclusive. Often the relation between risk and return has been found insignificant, and sometimes even negative. The innovation in this paper is to look at average stock risk in addition to market risk. We measure average stock risk in each month similarly to Campbell et al. (2001; hereafter Clmx), as the cross-sectional average of the variances of all the stocks traded in that month. We then run predictive regressions of market returns on this variance measure as well as the variance of the market. Consis- tent",

    "abstract": "We analyze competition among informed traders in the continuous-time Kyle (1985) model, as Foster and Viswanathan (1996) do in discrete time. We explic- itly describe the unique linear equilibrium when signals are imperfectly cor- related and confirm the conjecture of Holden and Subrahmanyam (1992) that there is no linear equilibrium when signals are perfectly correlated. One result is that at some date, and at all dates thereafter, the market would have been more informationally efficient had there been a monopolist informed trader in- stead of competing traders. The relatively large amount of private information remaining near the end of trading causes the market to approach complete illiquidity. How Will AN Investor With Information superior to the market trade? One intuition is that he will trade very aggressively, limited only by risk aver- sion and margin requirements. Another is that he will moderate his trades so as not to tip his hand too early. The Kyle (1985) model of informed trading supports the latter intuition. The informed trader in Kyle's model, when trading in continuous time, does so in such a way that his information is revealed at a constant rate. The first intuition is sup- ported by Holden and Subrahmanyam (1992). The difference between the two papers is that Holden and Subrahmanyam assume at least two traders have the same information.

    "abstract": "This paper tests the cross-sectional implications of “keeping-up-with-the-Joneses” (KUJ) preferences in an international setting. When agents have KUJ preferences, in the presence of undiversifiable nonfinancial wealth, both world and domestic risk (the idiosyncratic component of domestic wealth) are priced, and the equilibrium price of risk of the domestic factor is negative. We use labor income as a proxy for domestic wealth and find empirical support for these predictions. In terms of explaining the cross-section of stock returns and the size of the pricing errors, the model performs better than alternative international asset pricing models. IN This Paper we test the implications of an international asset pricing model where agents have preferences that are exogenously defined over both their own consumption as well as the contemporaneous average consumption of a reference group, defined in this paper as the agent’s countrymen. These pref- erences are termed “keeping up with the Joneses” (KUJ). In the absence of frictions, utility based on KUJ preferences yields the sym- metric equilibrium described in Gal´ı (1994), in which all agents hold the same global portfolio, and Joneses behavior translates into a lower price of risk on the single systematic risk factor. We consider two different specifications that incorporate frictions. The first is the case of standard KUJ preferences, in which agents’ marginal utility of consumption increases with the aggregate consump- tion o",

    "abstract": "We propose a new and direct measure of investor attention using search frequency in Google (Search Volume Index (SVI)). In a sample of Russell 3000 stocks from 2004 to 2008, we ﬁnd that SVI (1) is correlated with but different from existing proxies of investor attention; (2) captures investor attention in a more timely fashion and (3) likely measures the attention of retail investors. An increase in SVI predicts higher stock prices in the next 2 weeks and an eventual price reversal within the year. It also contributes to the large ﬁrst-day return and long-run underperformance of IPO stocks. What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence, a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efﬁciently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it. “Designing Organizations for an Information-Rich World,” in Martin Greenberger ,Computers, Com- munication, and the Public Interest[Baltimore, MD: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1971, 40–41] Herbert Simon, Nobel Laureate in Economics Traditional Asset PRICINGmodels assume that information is instantaneously incorporated into prices when it arrives.

    "title": "In Search of Distress Risk",
    "abstract": "This paper explores the determinants of corporate failure and the pricing of financially distressed stocks whose failure probability, estimated from a dynamic logit model using accounting and market variables, is high. Since 1981, financially distressed stocks have delivered anomalously low returns. They have lower returns but much higher standard deviations, market betas, and loadings on value and small-cap risk factors than stocks with low failure risk. These patterns are more pronounced for stocks with possible informational or arbitrage-related frictions. They are inconsistent with the conjecture that the value and size effects are compensation for the risk of financial distress. THE Concept OF Financial Distress has been invoked in the asset pricing lit- erature to explain otherwise anomalous patterns in the cross-section of stock returns (Chan and Chen (1991) and Fama and French (1996)). The idea is that certain companies have an elevated probability that they will fail to meet their financial obligations; the stocks of these financially distressed companies tend to move together, so their risk cannot be diversified away; and investors charge a premium for bearing such risk. 1 The premium for distress risk may not be cap- tured by the standard Capital Asset Pricing Model (capm) if corporate failures Duquesne Capital Management LLC.

I also argue that although the existing theories have delivered very important and useful insights, they seem to be quite ineffective in helping us cope with the new type of firms that is emerging. I outline the characteristics that a new theory of the firm should satisfy and how such a theory could change the way we do corporate finance, both theoretically and empirically. FOR A Relatively Young Researcher like myself, there is a very strong ten- dency to look at the history of corporate finance and be overwhelmed by the giants of the recent past. A field that 40 years ago was little more than a collection of cookbook recipes that reflected practitioners' common sense is today a bona fide discipline, taught not only to future practitioners but also to doctoral students, both in business schools and in economic departments-a discipline whose ideas are now influencing other areas of economics, such as industrial organization, monetary policy, and asset pricing. The quality and the impact of the contributions that were made to the field during the last 40 years, and in particular in the period from the late 1970s to the late 1980s, justify the widespread feeling that the \"golden age\" of corporate fi- nance is behind us.

    "abstract": "Sunk costs are unrecoverable costs that should not affect decision making. I pro- vide evidence that ﬁrms systematically fail to ignore sunk costs and that this leads to signiﬁcant investment distortions. In ﬁxed-exchange-ratio stock mergers, aggre- gate market ﬂuctuations after parties enter into a binding merger agreement induce plausibly exogenous variation in the ﬁnal acquisition cost. These quasi-random cost shocks strongly predict ﬁrms’ commitment to an acquired business following deal completion, with an interquartile cost increase reducing subsequent divestiture rates by 8% to 9%. Consistent with an intrapersonal sunk cost channel, distortions are con- centrated in ﬁrm-years in which the acquiring CEO is still in ofﬁce. Virtually Every Investment A Firm makes entails sunk costs that the ﬁrm has incurred and cannot recover.

    "abstract": "The reordering of transactions from “high-to-low” is a controversial bank practice thought to maximize fees paid by low-income customers on overdrawn accounts. We exploit a series of class-action lawsuits that mandated that some banks cease the practice.

    "title": "Incentive Compensation When Executives Can Hedge",
    "abstract": "Little evidence exists that firms index executive compensation to remove the influence of marketwide factors. We argue that executives can, in principle, replicate such indexation in their private portfolios. In support, we find that market risk has little effect on the use of stock-based pay for the average execu- tive. But executives' ability to \"undo\" excessive market risk can be hindered by wealth cohstraints and inalienability of human capital. We replicate the stan- dard result that there is little relative performance evaluation (RPE) for the average executive, but find strong evidence of RPE for younger executives and executives with less financial wealth. Researchers ARE Starting TO Make Sense of executive compensation. While there still exists controversy about whether the link between executive compensation and stock market value is sufficiently strong, there is no doubt that the link exists, on average, and has become stronger over time (see Jensen and Murphy (1990), Haubrich (1994), and Hall and Liebman (1998)). There is also ample evidence of heterogeneity in executive pay packages, as is suggested by contract theory. For instance, Aggarwal and Samwick (1999a) find evidence that firms tie their man- agers' pay more closely to stock values when such values are less volatile, confirm- ing a basic result of principal-agent theory. Another important theoretical prediction comes from Holmstrom (1982), who suggests that the market component of a firm's returns should",

    "title": "Incentive Effects of Stock and Option Holdings",
    "abstract": "Acquisitions enable target chief executive officers (CEOs) to remove liquidity restric- tions on stock and option holdings and diminish the illiquidity discount. Acquisitions also enable acquirer CEOs to improve the long-term value of overvalued holdings. Examining all firms during 1993 to 2001, we show that CEOs with higher holdings (illiquidity discount) are more likely to make acquisitions (get acquired). Further, in 250 completed acquisitions, target CEOs with a higher illiquidity discount accept a lower premium, offer less resistance, and more often leave after acquisition. Similarly, acquirer CEOs with higher holdings pay a higher premium, expedite the process, and make diversifying acquisitions using stock payment. Corporate Acquisitions ARE Important Restructuring Events as judged by their wealth creation and redistribution effects. Andrade, Mitchell, and Stafford (2001) report that 4,256 publicly traded firms in the U.S. Economy were acquired by other publicly traded firms during 1973–1998. These acquisitions resulted in average announcement-to-completion wealth gains of 23.8% to target share- holders, −3.8% to acquirer shareholders, and 1.9% to combined shareholders. A large part of the acquisition activity occurs in waves, and they document that the recent wave of 1990s was quite big. Casual observation suggests that this period was also characterized by an increase in the stock and option holdings of chief executive officers (CEOs). This paper analyzes the incenti",

    "abstract": "This paper examines the effect of incentive fees on the behavior of mutual fund managers. Funds with incentive fees exhibit positive stock selection ability, but a beta less than one results in funds not earning positive fees. From an investor's perspective, positive alphas plus lower expense ratios make incen- tive-fee funds attractive. However, incentive-fee funds take on more risk than non-incentive-fee funds, and they increase risk after a period of poor perfor- mance. Incentive fees are useful marketing tools, since more new cash flows go into incentive-fee funds than into non-incentive-fee funds, ceteris paribus. AN Incentive FEE is a reward structure that makes management compensation a function of investment performance relative to some benchmark. Incentive fees are often used to compensate the manager of investment assets. For example, hedge funds typically charge investors a fixed fee plus an incentive fee equal to between five percent and 25 percent of the funds annual return. Limited liability partnerships, such as commodity partnerships, real estate partnerships, and oil and gas partnerships, often charge incentive fees in excess of 20 percent of profits. There are a number of reasons why incentive fees are considered desirable. Perhaps the most often cited is that incentive fees align manager inter- est with investor interests. Both groups do better when the investment does bet- ter. Thus, the argument goes, management effort should be higher for funds with ince",

    "title": "Incentives and Endogenous Risk Taking: A",
    "abstract": "Hedge fund managers are subject to several nonlinear incentives: performance fee options (call); equity investors’ redemption options (put); and prime broker contracts allowing for forced deleverage (put). The interaction of these option-like incentives affects optimal leverage ex ante, depending on the distance of fund-value from the high-water mark. We study how these endogenous effects inﬂuence performance mea- sures used in the literature. We show that reduced-form measures that do not account for these features are subject to economically signiﬁcant false discovery biases. The result is stronger for low-quality funds. We propose an alternative structural method- ology for conducting performance attribution in hedge funds. This Paper Studies the implications of nonlinear managerial incentives and funding contracts for measures of risk-adjusted performance of hedge funds. We consider a structural model of a hedge fund manager who is subject to sev- eral of the contractual features that usually affect his payoff. These include: (i) performance fee–based incentives, (ii) funding options by the prime bro- ker, and (iii) the equity investor’s redemption options. Together, these features create a nonlinear payoff structure that affects the hedge fund manager’s lever- age decision. The resulting optimal portfolio choice is state-dependent due to the time-varying endogenous incentives perceived by the manager and varies depending on the distance of the assets under management (Au",

High-powered incentives lead to greater screening effort and more proﬁtable lending decisions. This effect is muted, however, by deferred compensation and limited liability, two standard features of loan ofﬁcer compensation contracts. We ﬁnd that career concerns and personality traits affect loan ofﬁcer behavior, but show that the response to incentives does not vary with traits such as risk-aversion, optimism, or overconﬁdence. Finally, we present evidence that incentives distort the assessment of credit risk, even among professionals with many years of experience.

    "abstract": "We propose a theoretical measure of income hedging demand and show that it affects asset prices. We focus on the value factor and ﬁrst demonstrate that our demand esti- mates are correlated with the actual demands of retail and mutual fund investors. We then show that the aggregate high-minus-low (HML) demand predicts HML returns. Exploiting the state-level variation in income risk, we demonstrate that state-level hedging demands predict state-level HML returns. A long-short portfolio that exploits this hedging-induced predictability earns an annualized risk-adjusted return of 6%. Income Risk IS A FUNDAMENTALsource of uncertainty that households face, and hence it should affect their ﬁnancial decisions. Several recent studies demon- strate that income risk inﬂuences the portfolio decisions of U.S. And Euro- pean households. For example, Angerer and Lam (2009) demonstrate that U.S. Households with higher permanent income risk invest less in risky assets. Betermier et al. (2012) show that the ﬁnancial decisions of Swedish households are sensitive to wage volatility. A related literature provides household-level evidence that portfolio deci- sions are affected by income hedging considerations. Bonaparte, Korniotis, and Kumar (2014) ﬁnd evidence of income hedging in the decisions of Dutch and U.S. Households. They show that households whose income growth is highly correlated with market returns participate less in the market and allocate less of their wealth to risky assets. Usin",

    "title": "Income Risk and Portfolio Choice:",
    "abstract": "This paper investigates the relationship between portfolio choice and labor income risk in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 Cohort. Permanent income risk (variability of shocks to income that have permanent effect) significantly reduces the share of risky assets in the household’s portfolio, while transitory income risk (variability of shocks with no lasting effect) does not. This result provides strong evidence that households’ portfolio choices respond to labor income risks in a manner consistent with economic theory. Theoretical Work HAS Shown that uninsurable labor income risk is likely to reduce the share of risky assets in an investor’s portfolio (Pratt and Zeckhauser (1987), Kimball (1993), Bertaut and Haliassos (1997), Koo (1998, 1999), Elmendorf and Kimball (2000)). In a dynamic context, when labor in- come consists of components of different persistence, the magnitude of this effect should depend on the persistence associated with the risk—the risk to a persistent component should have a larger effect than the risk to a transi- tory component. Surprisingly, however, empirical work has not examined this interesting implication of the theory. This paper uses the rich information con- tained in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 Cohort (nlsy79) to examine this implication. We assume that labor income has two components: permanent and transitory. We then measure the risks of the components for a sample of households in the survey and estimate t",

    "abstract": "Because of non-traded human capital, real-world ﬁnancial markets are massively incomplete, while the modeling of imperfect, dynamic ﬁnancial markets remains a wide-open and difﬁcult ﬁeld. Some 30 years after Cox, Ross, and Rubinstein (1979) taught us how to calculate the prices of derivative securities on an event tree by simple backward induction, we show how a similar formulation can be used in computing heterogeneous-agents incomplete-market equilibrium prices of primitive securities. Extant methods work forward and backward, requiring a guess of the way investors forecast the future. In our method, the future is part of the current solution of each backward time step. “No information available in periodt apart from the level of consump- tion, ct, helps predict future consumption,ct+1, in the sense of affecting the expected value of marginal utility. In particular, income or wealth in period t or earlier [is] irrelevant, oncect is known.” Robert E. Hall (1978), corollary 1, page 974. Real-world Financial Markets are massively incomplete because vast amounts of human capital cannot be traded and endowment/labor shocks are not fully insurable. For this reason, it is quite possible that the investigation of incomplete-market equilibria will eventually deliver a solution to some of the well-known “puzzles” encountered in ﬁnancial-market data (excess volatility, equity premium, level of the rate of interest).

    "abstract": "Indirect incentives exist in the money management industry when good current performance increases future inflows of capital, leading to higher future fees. For the average hedge fund, indirect incentives are at least 1. 4 times as large as direct incentives from incentive fees and managers’ personal stakes in the fund . Combining direct and indirect incentives, manager wealth increases by at least $0. 39 for a $1 increase in investor wealth. Younger and more scalable hedge funds ha ve stronger flow-performance relations, leading to stronger indirect incentives. These results have a number of implications for our understanding of incentives in the asset management industry.",

    "title": "Individual Investor Trading and Return Patterns",
    "abstract": "This paper provides evidence of informed trading by individual investors around earn- ings announcements using a unique data set of Nyse stocks. We show that intense aggregate individual investor buying (selling) predicts large positive (negative) ab- normal returns on and after earnings announcement dates. We decompose abnormal returns following the event into information and liquidity provision components, and show that about half of the returns can be attributed to private information. We also ﬁnd that individuals trade in both return-contrarian and news-contrarian man- ners after earnings announcements. The latter behavior has the potential to slow the adjustment of prices to earnings news. DO Individual Investors GAINby trading on private information? Do they pos- sess skills in interpreting public information? While individual investors are often portrayed in the behavioral ﬁnance literature as unsophisticated “noise” traders who are subject to fads and psychological biases, these important ques- tions have added relevance in light of recent interest in theoretical models where information ﬂows from investors to managers who make choices that inﬂuence the real economy. The potential information advantage of individuals is counterintuitive given the vast resources institutions devote to gathering information. Nonetheless, there are at least two reasons to explore the information content of the trades of individual investors. First, even if each individual investor has ve",

    "title": "Individual Investor Trading and Stock Returns",
    "abstract": "This paper investigates the dynamic relation between net individual investor trading and short-horizon returns for a large cross-section of Nyse stocks. The evidence in- dicates that individuals tend to buy stocks following declines in the previous month and sell following price increases. We document positive excess returns in the month following intense buying by individuals and negative excess returns after individuals sell, which we show is distinct from the previously shown past return or volume effects. The patterns we document are consistent with the notion that risk-averse individuals provide liquidity to meet institutional demand for immediacy. FOR A Variety OF Reasons , financial economists tend to view individuals and institutions differently. In particular, while institutions are viewed as informed investors, individuals are believed to have psychological biases and are often thought of as the proverbial noise traders in the sense of Kyle (1985) or Black (1986). One of the questions of interest to researchers in finance is how the behavior of different investor clienteles or their interaction in the market affects returns. In this paper we focus on the interaction between individual investors and stock returns. Specifically, we examine the short-horizon dynamic relation between the buy- ing and selling by individuals and both previous and subsequent returns using a unique data set provided to us by the Nyse. The data set was constructed from the NYSE’s Consolidate",

    "title": "Individual Investors and Local Bias",
    "abstract": "The paper tests whether individuals have value-relevant information about local stocks (where “local” is deﬁned as being headquartered near where an investor lives). Our methodology uses two types of calendar-time portfolios—one based on holdings and one based on transactions. Portfolios of local holdings do not generate abnormal performance (alphas are zero). When studying transactions, purchases of local stocks signiﬁcantly underperform sales of local stocks. The underperformance remains when focusing on stocks with potentially high levels of information asymmetries. We con- clude that individuals do not help incorporate information into stock prices. Our conclusions directly contradict existing studies. This Paper Studies THE Geography of individual investors’ portfolios. Recent local stocks. For example, the typical U.S. Household has about 30% of its port- folio invested in stocks headquartered within a 250-mile radius of the family’s home. On average, only 12% of all ﬁrms (the market) are headquartered within the same radius. In Finland, the median non-Helsinki-headquartered ﬁrm has 12% greater weight among investors in its municipality than it does among all Finnish investors. And, in mainland China, individuals invest 8% more in ﬁrms from their province of residence than a market capitalization portfolio would predict. 1 However, despite consistent and strong evidence of local bias, an unan- swered question remains: Why do investors have a preference for local stocks?",

    "title": "Individual Investors and Volatility",
    "abstract": "We show that retail trading activity has a positive effect on the volatility of stock returns, which suggests that retail investors behave as noise traders. To identify this effect, we use a reform of the French stock market that raises the relative cost of speculative trading for retail investors. The daily return volatility of the stocks affected by the reform falls by 20 basis points (a quarter of the sample standard deviation of the return volatility) relative to other stocks. For affected stocks, we also ﬁnd a signiﬁcant decrease in the magnitude of return reversals and the price impact of trades. Anything that changes the amount or character of noise trading will change the volatility of price. —Fischer Black (1986, p. 533). IN This Paper, we test whether retail trading is a determinant of the idiosyn- cratic volatility of stock returns. This test has broad implications because the volatility of stock returns is a key variable in various areas of ﬁnance (e.g., asset pricing or risk management) yet its determinants are not well understood. For instance, Shiller (1981), Leroy and Porter (1981), and Roll (1988) show that volatility cannot be explained solely by changes in fundamentals. Moreover, the determinants of the time-series behavior of idiosyncratic volatility are still open to debate (e.g., Campbell et al. (2001), Wei and Zhang (2006), Brandt et al. (2010), Fink et al.

    "title": "Individualism and Momentum around the World",
    "abstract": "This paper examines how cultural differences inﬂuence the returns of momentum strategies. Cross-country cultural differences are measured with an individualism index developed by Hofstede (2001), which is related to overconﬁdence and self- attribution bias. We ﬁnd that individualism is positively associated with trading volume and volatility, as well as to the magnitude of momentum proﬁts. Momentum proﬁts are also positively related to analyst forecast dispersion, transaction costs, and the familiarity of the market to foreigners, and negatively related to ﬁrm size and volatility. However, the addition of these and other variables does not dampen the relation between individualism and momentum proﬁts. A Substantial Literature Examines what is generally referred to as the mo- mentum effect—the observation that stocks that perform the best in the recent past continue to perform well in the future. For example, Jegadeesh and Titman (1993, 2001) ﬁnd that stocks in the United States that realize the best (worst) returns over the past 3 to 12 months continue to perform well (poorly) over the subsequent 3 to 12 months. The proﬁtability of momentum strategies is found in equity markets throughout the world (see, for example, Rouwenhorst (1998) for a study of momentum in Europe and Grifﬁn, Ji, and Martin (2003) of Science and Technology.

    "abstract": "Firms in more concentrated industries earn lower returns, even after controlling for size, book-to-market, momentum, and other return determinants. Explanations based on chance, measurement error, capital structure, and persistent in-sample cash flow shocks do not explain this finding. Drawing on work in industrial organization, we posit that either barriers to entry in highly concentrated industries insulate firms from undiversifiable distress risk, or firms in highly concentrated industries are less risky because they engage in less innovation, and thereby command lower expected returns. Additional time-series tests support these risk-based interpretations. Firms Generate Cash Flows Through their actions in product markets. These risky cash flows are in turn priced in financial markets. Yet the economic link between product markets and asset prices remains relatively unexplored. This paper explores the link between industry concentration and average stock re- turns, offering the first empirical evidence of the asset pricing implications of industry market structure. There are a number of potential reasons why the structure of product mar- kets may affect stock returns. Firms take operating decisions that may affect the riskiness of their cash flows. These operating decisions arise from an equi- librium in the product market that potentially reflects strategic interactions among market participants. Therefore, the structure of product markets may affect the risk of a firm’s",

    "title": "Industry-Speciﬁc Human Capital, Idiosyncratic",
    "abstract": "Human capital is one of the largest assets in the economy and in theory may play an important role for asset pricing. Human capital is heterogeneous across investors. One source of heterogeneity is industry afﬁliation. I show that the cross-section of expected stock returns is primarily affected by industry-level rather than aggregate labor income risk. Furthermore, when human capital is excluded from the asset pricing model, the resulting idiosyncratic risk may appear to be priced. I ﬁnd that the premium for idiosyncratic risk documented by several empirical studies depends on the covariance between stock and human capital returns. According TO Traditional ASSETpricing theory, investors choose their optimal portfolios by maximizing the expected utility of their lifetime consumption. In addition to investments in tradable assets such as stocks and bonds, part of their wealth is typically tied up in nontradable assets. A nontradable asset that forms a signiﬁcant fraction of wealth for virtually all investors is human capital. Heaton and Lucas (2000)report that about 48% of household wealth is due to human capital, while only 6.8% is invested in ﬁnancial assets.Lustig, van Nieuwerburgh, and Verdelhan (2010)even estimate human capital to be 90% of total wealth, while the share of equities is only 2%. This suggests that, in theory, human capital should matter for portfolio choice and asset pricing. The Editor (Campbell Harvey), the Associate Editor, and an anonymous referee for i",

    "abstract": "Motivated by the recent rise of populism in Western democracies, we develop a tractable equilibrium model in which a populist backlash emerges endogenously in a strong economy. In the model, voters dislike inequality, especially the high con- sumption of “elites.” Economic growth exacerbates inequality due to heterogeneity in preferences , which leads to heterogeneity in returns on capital. In response to rising inequality, voters optimally elect a populist promising to end globalization. Equality is a luxury good. Countries with more inequality, higher ﬁnancial development, and trade deﬁcits are more vulnerable to populism, both in the model and in the data. “Let us not be naive.

    "title": "Inference in Long-Horizon Event Studies:",
    "abstract": "Statistical inference in long-horizon event studies has been hampered by the fact that abnormal returns are neither normally distributed nor independent. This study presents a new approach to inference that overcomes these difficulties and domi- nates other popular testing methods. I illustrate the use of the methodology by examining the long-horizon returns of initial public offerings (IPOs). I find that the Fama and French (1993) three-factor model is inconsistent with the observed long-horizon price performance of these IPOs, whereas a characteristic-based model cannot be rejected. Recent Empirical Studies IN Finance document systematic long-run abnormal price reactions subsequent to numerous corporate activities.1 Since these results imply that stock prices react with a long delay to publicly available information, they appear to be at odds with the Efficient Markets Hypoth- esis (EMH). Long-run event studies, however, are subject to serious statistical difficul- ties that weaken their usefulness as tests of the EMH. In particular, most studies maintain the standard assumptions that abnormal returns are in- dependent and normally distributed although these assumptions fail to hold even approximately at long horizons. First, samples of long-horizon abnor- mal returns are not independently distributed because many of the sample of Brad Barber, Michael Barclay, Kobi Boudoukh, Michael Brandt, George Constantinides, Zvi Gilula, Paul Gompers, John Graham, David Hsieh, Shmuel Ka",

    "title": "Information Acquisition in Rumor-Based Bank",
    "abstract": "We study information acquisition and dynamic withdrawal decisions when a spread- ing rumor exposes a solvent bank to a run. Uncertainty about the bank’s liquidity and potential failure motivates depositors who hear the rumor to acquire additional noisy signals. Depositors with less informative signals may wait before gradually running on the bank, leading to an endogenous aggregate withdrawal speed and bank survival time. Private information acquisition about liquidity can subject solvent-but-illiquid banks to runs, and shorten the survival time of failing banks. Public provision of sol- vency information can mitigate runs by indirectly crowding-out individual depositors’ effort to acquire liquidity information. Bank Runs ARE Unfortunately still with us. Runs occurred recently on major traditional banks such as Northern Rock and IndyMac, and on nontraditional “shadow” banks. In Section I, we document several intriguing features of the largest-ever bank failure, which resulted from the 2008 run on Washington Mutual: (i) the bank survived a ﬁrst run, followed by deposit inﬂows; (ii) rumors circulated, but there was no public information of the ﬁrst run happening; (iii) uncertainty about bank liquidity played a key role in a second fatal run; (iv) both runs had an important time dimension; and (v) worried depositors (even those covered by deposit insurance) acquired additional information, then some withdrew immediately, while others decided to wait.

    "abstract": "When a group of investors with dispersed private information jointly invest in a risky project, how should they divide the project’s proﬁt? We show that a simple contract dividing proﬁts in proportion to investors’ risk tolerances may facilitate in- formation aggregation by altering investors’ risk-taking incentives when they decide on how investment strategies respond to private information. Our results provide a contracting-based approach for information aggregation, which is an alternative to learning from endogenous market variables (e.g., prices) via contingent schedules as seen in well-known rational expectations equilibrium models. A Large Literature Studies Information aggregation via secondary mar- ket trading. In these papers, investors submit sets of limit orders that consti- tute demand schedules for a risky asset in inelastic supply, and equilibrium trading quantities are contingent on the realized market-clearing price, which is an implicit function of all investors’ information. 1 In contrast, in this paper, we study the less explored topic of information aggregation via contracting.

We provide a general characterization of asset returns by means of a risk- neutral probability measure that features excess weight on tail risks. Moreover, we link excess weight on tail risks to observable moments such as forecast dispersion and accuracy , and argue that it provides a uniﬁed explanation for several prominent cross-sectional return anomalies. Simple calibrations suggest the model can account for a signiﬁcant fraction of empirical returns to skewness, returns to disagreement, and interaction effects between the two. Dispersed Information , AND AS A result disagreement among investors, is a ubiquitous feature of ﬁnancial markets, and asset prices are often viewed as playing a central role in aggregating such information. We develop a ﬂexible theory in which aggregation of dispersed information emerges as the core force determining asset prices and expected returns. We link prices and returns to the distribution of the underlying asset payoffs and market features such as liquidity and investor disagreement.

    "abstract": "We examine the effect of information asymmetry on equity prices in the local A- and foreign B-share market in China. We construct measures of information asymmetry based on market microstructure models, and find that they explain a significant por- tion of cross-sectional variation in B-share discounts, even after controlling for other factors. On a univariate basis, the price impact measure and the adverse selection component of the bid-ask spread in the A- and B-share markets explains 44% and 46% of the variation in B-share discounts. On a multivariate basis, both measures are far more statistically significant than any of the control variables. THE Extent OF Information Asymmetry in the international equity market has become a very important topic. The question of whether domestic investors have better information than foreign investors has also become increasingly controversial. For instance, a few papers argue that domestic investors have a linguistic and cultural advantage (Brennan and Cao (1997), Choe, Kho, and Stulz (2001), and Hau (2001)), others argue that foreign investors have an infor- mational advantage because they possess a significant amount of investment experience and expertise (Seasholes (2000), Grinblatt and Keloharju (2000), Menkveld is from the Faculty of Economics and Business Administration, Vrije Universiteit Am- Yakov Amihud, Y.

    "abstract": "I empirically explore the syndicated loan market, with an emphasis on how informa- tion asymmetry between lenders and borrowers influences syndicate structure and on which lenders become syndicate members. Consistent with moral hazard in moni- toring, the lead bank retains a larger share of the loan and forms a more concentrated syndicate when the borrower requires more intense monitoring and due diligence. When information asymmetry between the borrower and lenders is potentially se- vere, participant lenders are closer to the borrower, both geographically and in terms of previous lending relationships. Lead bank and borrower reputation mitigates, but does not eliminate information asymmetry problems. Syndicated Loans ARE A Large and increasingly important source of corporate finance. Nonfinancial U.S. Businesses obtain almost $1 trillion in new syndi- cated loans each year, which represents approximately 15% of their aggregate debt outstanding, and of the largest 500 nonfinancial firms in the Compus- tat universe in 2002, almost 90% obtained a syndicated loan between 1994 and 2002. Indeed, according to the American Banker, syndicated lending represents 51% of U.S. Corporate finance originated, and generates more underwriting rev- enue for the financial sector than both equity and debt underwriting (Weidner (2000)).

    "abstract": "I examine the effects of information asymmetry–driven mispricing on security is- suance. Using predisclosure changes in purchase obligations as a proxy for informa- tion asymmetry–driven mispricing, I ﬁnd that managers avoid (prefer) issuing se- curities when they perceive their ﬁrms to be undervalued (overvalued). The effects of information asymmetry–driven mispricing are stronger on equity issuance than debt issuance. Consequently, undervaluation (overvaluation) causes an increase (de- crease) in leverage. These effects are more pronounced for ﬁrms, periods, and securi- ties associated with greater information asymmetry. The stock-trading patterns that managers follow suggest that their perceived mispricing is an important factor in both private and ﬁrm-level decisions. A Manager Typically HAS Superior information about his or her ﬁrm’s future performance relative to what outside investors know. This information asymmetry can cause a ﬁrm to be undervalued or overvalued in the market relative to the manager’s perception. Such information asymmetry–driven mis- pricing may affect a range of managerial decisions. In this paper, I investigate the effect of information asymmetry–driven mispricing on security issuance. Addressing this question presents a challenge because it is difﬁcult to mea- sure mispricing caused by information asymmetry. First, measuring mispric- ing, regardless of the cause, is difﬁcult because the true value of ﬁrm shares is not observable. Some studies on",

Our findings, for the period from 1985 to 1997 indicate that in- sider gains in R&D-intensive firms are substantially larger than insider gains in firms without R&D. Insiders also take advantage of information on planned changes in R&D budgets. R&D is thus a major contributor to information asymmetry and insider gains, raising issues concerning management compensation, incentives, and disclosure policies. Researchers have documented that \"corporate insiders,\" defined by the 1934 Securities and Exchange Act as corporate officers, directors, and owners of 10 percent or more of any equity class of securities, gain from trading in the securities of their firms.1 However, the specific sources of information lead- ing to insider gains in particular and to information asymmetry in general have not been comprehensively investigated. An identification of the sources of insiders' information contributes to our knowledge in various ways. For example, researchers often use proxies for the extent of information asym- metry, such as the number of analysts following a firm, the number of com- peting traders, or insiders' and institutional ownership (e.g., Stoll (1978), grateful for the comments and suggestions made by Yakov Amihud, Je",

    "abstract": "Economic interactions often involve sequential actions, observational learning, and contingent project implementation. We incorporate all-or-nothing thresholds in a canonical model of information cascades. Early supporters effectively delegate their decisions to a “gatekeeper,” resulting in unidirectional cascades without herding on rejections. Project proposers can consequently charge higher prices. Proposal feasi- bility, project selection, and information aggregation all improve, even when agents can wait.

    "title": "Information Cascades: Evidence from a Field",
    "abstract": "Previous empirical studies of information cascades use either naturally occurring data in a controlled environment. Analysis of over 1,500 individual decisions suggests that Cbot professionals behave differently from our student control group. For instance, professionals are better able to discern the quality of public signals and their decisions are not affected by the domain of earnings. These results have implications for market efficiency and are important in both a positive and normative sense. IN Economic AND Financial Environments in which decision makers have imper- fect information about the true state of the world, it can be rational to ignore one’s own private information and make decisions based upon what are believed to be more informative public signals. In particular, if decisions are made se- quentially and earlier decisions are public information, “information cascades” can result. Information cascades arise when individuals rationally choose iden- tical actions despite having different private information. 1 Cascades may arise an associate editor, and an anonymous reviewer for sharp comments that improved the study Trade, authorized this study.

    "title": "Information Consumption and Asset Pricing",
    "abstract": "We study whether ﬁrm and macroeconomic announcements that convey system- atic information generate a return premium for ﬁrms that experience information spillovers. We use information consumption to proxy for investor learning during these announcements and construct ex ante measures of expected information con- sumption (EIC) to calibrate whether learning is priced. On days when there are infor- mation spillovers, affected stocks earn a signiﬁcant return premium (5% annualized) and the capital asset pricing model performs better. The positive effect of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee announcements on the risk premia of individual stocks appears to be modulated by EIC. Our ﬁndings are most consistent with a risk- based explanation. HOW Information Becomes Incorporated Into asset prices is one of the most fundamental questions in ﬁnance. It has long been accepted that risk premia should accrue on days when information gets processed, resolves uncertainty, and generates systematic price movements (e.g., Beaver (1968), Kalay and Loewenstein (1985)). Yet despite the long-standing importance of this idea, there has been renewed interest in these risk premia and the perfor- mance of the capital asset pricing model (capm) during scheduled information versity.

    "abstract": "We examine corporate governance effectiveness when the CEO generates project ideas and the board of directors screens these ideas for approval. However, the precision of the board’s screening information is controlled by the CEO. Moreover, both the CEO and the board have career concerns that interact. The board’s career concerns cause it to distort its investment recommendation procyclically, whereas the CEO’s career concerns cause her to sometimes reduce the precision of the board’s information. More- over, the CEO sometimes prefers a less able board, and this happens only during eco- nomic upturns, suggesting that corporate governance will be weaker during economic upturns. Behind every great fortune is a crime. —Honor´ e de Balzac THE U.S. Corporate Governance Landscape has been transformed in recent years by high-profile governance failures at Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, ImClone, Adelphia, Global Crossing, and others. In response, Congress passed the most important corporate governance legislation since the Securities Exchange Act of 1934: the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX hereafter). 1 SOX has four key features. First, it requires accurate, extensive, and timely information disclo- sures, mandating public firms to establish and maintain “an adequate internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting” with an annual assess- ment of the effectiveness of such internal controls that is attested to by external auditors.

    "title": "Information Disclosure and Corporate",
    "abstract": "Public policy discussions typically favor greater corporate disclosure as a way to reduce ﬁrms’ agency problems. This argument is incomplete because it overlooks that better disclosure regimes can also aggravate agency problems and related costs, including executive compensation. Consequently, a point can exist beyond which ad- ditional disclosure decreases ﬁrm value. Holding all else equal, we further show that larger ﬁrms will adopt stricter disclosure rules than smaller ﬁrms and ﬁrms with bet- ter disclosure will employ more able management. We show that mandated increases in disclosure could, in part, explain recent increases in both CEO compensation and CEO turnover rates. A Response TO Recent corporate governance scandals, such as Enron and Worldcom, has been the imposition of tougher disclosure requirements. For example, Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) requires more and better information: more, for instance, by requiring reporting of off-balance sheet ﬁnancing and special purpose entities, and better by its increasing the penalties for misreporting. In the public’s (and regulators’) view, improved disclosure is good. This view is an old one, dating at least toRipley (1927)and Berle and Means (1932). Indeed, there are good reasons why disclosure can increase the value of a ﬁrm. For instance, reducing the asymmetry of information between those inside the ﬁrm and those outside can facilitate a ﬁrm’s ability to issue securi- ties and consequently lower its cost of capital.1 Fear of",

    "abstract": "Can psychology-guided information disclosure induce borrowers to lower their use of high-cost debt? In a ﬁeld experiment at payday stores, we ﬁnd that information that makes people think less narrowly (over time) about ﬁnance costs results in less borrowing. In particular, reinforcing the adding-up dollar fees incurred when rolling over loans reduces the take-up of future payday loans by 11% in the subsequent 4 months. Although we remain agnostic as to the overall sufﬁciency of better disclosure policy to “remedy” payday borrowing, we cast the 11% reduction in borrowing in light of the relative low cost of this policy. IN 2007, Americans Paid ANestimated $8 billion in ﬁnancial charges to borrow $50 billion from payday lenders.1 In a typical payday loan transaction, a bor- rower receives cash from the payday lender in exchange for an authorization to draw the cash advance plus a ﬁxed fee of $15 to $17 for every $100 of loan from the borrower’s bank account on the next paycheck date.2 Annualizing this fee reveals that payday loans are indeed expensive, with implied APRs (annual percentage rates) usually well over 400%. Industry insiders contend that transaction costs are high due to the short-term, high-risk nature of bridge loans. Consumer advocates argue that payday lenders prey on those that are so ﬁnancially illiterate or unsophisticated that they are willing to take up such a number of people for helpful comments, including John Caskey, Shawn Cole, Todd Gormley, Victoria I",

    "abstract": "We analyze a model in which different traders are informed of different fundamentals that affect the security value. We identify a source for strategic complementarities in trading and information acquisition: aggressive trading on information about one fundamental reduces uncertainty in trading on information about the other funda- mental, encouraging more trading and information acquisition on that fundamental. This tends to amplify the effect of exogenous changes in the underlying information environment. Due to complementarities, greater diversity of information in the econ- omy improves price informativeness. We discuss the relation between our model and recent ﬁnancial phenomena and derive testable empirical implications. Security Prices Reflect Information available to traders about future pay- offs. Uncertainty about these payoffs typically involves multiple dimensions. Obvious examples include multinational ﬁrms, for which there is uncertainty originating from the different countries where the ﬁrm operates, and conglom- erates, for which there is uncertainty about the different industries the ﬁrm operates in. More generally, even focused ﬁrms are exposed to multiple dimen- sions of uncertainty: cash ﬂows depend on the demand for ﬁrms’ products and the technology they develop, on ﬁrms’ idiosyncratic developments and the way they are affected by the macroeconomy or the industry, and on the success of ﬁrms’ operations in traditional lines of business and in new speculat",

The analysis draws on a data set covering a broad cross-section of currencies and different customer segments of FX end-users. The results suggest that order ﬂows are highly informative about future exchange rates and provide signiﬁcant economic value. We also ﬁnd that different customer groups can share risk with each other effectively through the intermediation of a large dealer, and differ markedly in their predictive ability, trading styles, and risk exposure. THE Foreign Exchange(fx) Market is the largest ﬁnancial market in the world, with a daily trading volume of about ﬁve trillion U.S. Dollars (USDs; Bank for International Settlements (BIS, 2013)). Also, the FX market is largely orga- nized as an over-the-counter (OTC) market, meaning that there is no central- ized exchange and that market participants can have only partial knowledge about the trades of other market participants and available liquidity in differ- ent market segments.

    "abstract": "Many argue that home bias arises because home investors can predict home asset payoffs more accurately than foreigners can. But why does global information ac- cess not eliminate this asymmetry? We model investors, endowed with a small home information advantage, who choose what information to learn before they invest. Sur- prisingly, even when home investors can learn what foreigners know, they choose not to: Investors profit more from knowing information others do not know. Learning am- plifies information asymmetry. The model matches patterns of local and industry bias, foreign investments, portfolio outperformance, and asset prices. Finally, we propose Observed Returns ON National equity portfolios suggest substantial benefits from international diversification, yet individuals and institutions in most countries hold modest amounts of foreign equity. Many studies document such “home bias” (see French and Poterba (1991), Tesar and Werner (1998), and Ahearne, Griever, and Warnock (2004)). While restrictions on international cap- ital flows may have been a viable explanation for the home bias 30 years ago, they no longer are today. An alternative hypothesis contends that home in- vestors have superior access to information about domestic firms or economic conditions. This information-based theory of the home bias implicitly assumes that home investors cannot learn about foreign firms, replacing the old assump- tion of capital immobility by the similar assumption of informati",

    "abstract": "We show that aversion to risk and ambiguity leads to information inertia when in- vestors process public news about assets. Optimal portfolios do not always depend on news that is worse than expected; hence, the equilibrium stock price does not reﬂect this bad news. This informational inefﬁciency is more severe when there is more risk and ambiguity but disappears when investors are risk-neutral or the news is about idiosyncratic risk. Information inertia leads to news momentum (e.g., after earnings announcements) and is consistent with low household trading activity . An ambiguity premium helps explain the macro and earnings announcement premium. Fama ’S Efficient Markets Hypothesis Ignited a lot of empirical and the- idence points to the importance of this role since most of the expected excess return is earned around times when important information is released—the macro and earnings announcement premiums. During such times, prices un- derreact to news and thus fail to efﬁciently incorporate this information (Savor (2012)), leading to news momentum one of the most robust manifestations of which is postearnings announcement drift (pead).

    "abstract": "This paper asks how well different organizational structures perform in terms of generating information about investment projects and allocating capital to these projects. A decentralized approach-with small, single-manager firms-is most likely to be attractive when information about projects is \"soft\" and cannot be credibly transmitted. In contrast, large hierarchies perform better when information can be costlessly \"hardened\" and passed along inside the firm. The model can be used to think about the consequences of consolidation in the banking industry, particularly the documented tendency for mergers to lead to declines in small-business lending. IN This Paper, I Take UP the following question: How does organization design influence the process by which capital is allocated to competing investment projects? I contrast two basic organizational forms. The first is \"decentral- ization,\" in which small, single-manager firms choose between relatively few projects. The second is \"hierarchy,\" in which large firms with multiple layers of management evaluate many projects. The goal is to understand what project- level characteristics lead either decentralization or hierarchy to be the pre- ferred design. This question can be given a concrete motivation. Over the last several years, there has been enormous consolidation in the banking industry, both in the United States and worldwide. This consolidation has been accompa- nied by widely voiced concerns that the resulting larger banks",

    "title": "Information Quality and Long-Run Risk: Asset",
    "abstract": "I study the asset pricing implications of the quality of public information about persistent productivity shocks in a general equilibrium model with Kreps–Porteus preferences. Low information quality is associated with a high equity premium, a low volatility of consumption growth, and a low volatility of the risk-free interest rate. The relationship between information quality and the equity premium differs from that in endowment economies. My calibration improves substantially upon the Bansal–Yaron model in terms of the moments of the wealth–consumption ratio and the return on aggregate wealth. IN This Paper, I introduce learning into a production-based long-run risk model. Learning improves the asset pricing implications of the model along three di- mensions: it increases the equilibrium equity premium, reduces the volatility of consumption growth, and reduces the volatility of the risk-free interest rate. I show that because of the production economy setting, the relationship be- tween information quality and the equity premium differs from that found in pure exchange economies (see, e.g., Veronesi (2000)). Quantitatively, my model improves substantially upon the Bansal and Yaron (2004) model in terms of its predictions about the volatility of the return on aggregate wealth and the wealth–consumption ratio. Compared to Bansal and Yaron (2004), I use a lower relative risk aversion (RRA) parameter, two, and a higher intertemporal elas- ticity of substitution (IES) parameter,",

    "title": "Information Revelation in Decentralized Markets",
    "abstract": "How does information get revealed in decentralized markets? We test several hy- potheses inspired by recent dealer-network theory. To do so, we construct an em- pirical map of information revelation where two dealers are connected based on the synchronicity of their quote changes. The tests, based on the euro to Swiss franc spot rate (eur/chf) quote data including the 2015 crash, largely support theory: strongly connected (i.e., central) dealers are more informed. Connections are weaker when there is less to be learned. The crash serves to identify how a network forms when dealers are transitioned from no-learning to learning, that is, from a ﬁxed to a ﬂoating rate. Technology Facilitates THE Entry OF electronic markets that are cheap to set up and easy to tailor to various clienteles. New markets successfully compete with incumbent ones. Many dealers, for example, have started their own markets. As a result, securities are increasingly traded in decentralized markets. This trend holds for all asset classes (Johnson ( 2010, Chapters 2,3)). New market entry delivers well-known beneﬁts of competition (e.g., lower fees and better products), yet might be socially costly. The reason is that end-users become dispersed across markets, which potentially inhibits efﬁcient re-allocations, as decentralized markets lead to costly cross-market search for efﬁcient trades.

    "abstract": "Fundamental information resembles in many respects a durable good. Hence, the ef- fects of its incorporation into stock prices depend on who is the agent controlling its flow. Like a durable goods monopolist, a monopolistic analyst selling information in- tertemporally competes against herself. This forces her to partially relinquish control over the information flow to traders. Conversely, an insider solves the intertempo- ral competition problem through vertical integration, thus exerting tighter control over the information flow. Comparing market patterns I show that a dynamic market where information is provided by an analyst isthicker and more informative than one where an insider trades. Organized Stock Markets Facilitate THE Exchange of assets among traders thereby allowing a firm’s fundamental information to be impounded into prices. There are mainly two ways by which this occurs: either traders acquire infor- mation from a specialized provider (e.g., an analyst), or they obtain it thanks to a particular relationship they have with the firm (i.e., they are insiders). Far from being irrelevant, the way information is gathered to the market dra- matically affects the characteristics of stock prices. This paper shows that the dynamic properties of a market closely depend on who is the agent exerting control over the flow of information. In many respects, fundamental information resembles a durable good. In- deed, a trader holding a signal on a firm’s payoff can use this",

    "abstract": "There is substantial evidence of short-term stock price continuation, which the prior literature often attributes to investor behavioral biases such as underreaction to new information. This paper investigates the role of information uncertainty in price con- tinuation anomalies and cross-sectional variations in stock returns. If short-term price continuation is due to investor behavioral biases, we should observe greater price drift when there is greater information uncertainty. As a result, greater information uncertainty should produce relatively higher expected returns following good news and relatively lower expected returns following bad news. My evidence supports this hypothesis. There IS Substantial Evidence OF Short -term stock price continuation, which the prior literature often attributes to investor underreaction to new information. Examples include the positive serial correlation of returns at 3- to 12-month horizons (Jegadeesh and Titman (1993)), post-earnings announcement stock price drift in the direction indicated by the earnings surprise, and post-event return drift in the direction of the announcement date return. In this paper I investigate how information uncertainty contributes to this phenomenon. By information uncertainty, I mean ambiguity with respect to the implications of new information for a firm’s value, which potentially stems from two sources: the volatility of a firm’s underlying fundamentals and poor information. 2 My main hypothesis is that",

    "abstract": "This paper develops a theory of control as a signal of congruence of objectives, and applies it to financial contracting between an investor and a privately informed en- trepreneur. We show that formal investor control is (i) increasing in the informa- tion asymmetries ex ante, (ii) increasing in the uncertainty surrounding the venture ex post, (iii) decreasing in the entrepreneur’s resources, and (iv) increasing in the entrepreneur’s incentive conflict. In contrast, real investor control—that is, actual investor interference—is decreasing in information asymmetries. Control rights are further such that control shifts to the investor in bad states of nature. Should Better -informed Parties Receive more control rights in ventures or al- ture capitalists face substantial uncertainty when financing new ventures. Uncertainty and asymmetric information on behalf of the entrepreneur, how- ever, are shown to be significantly correlated with less entrepreneur control, not more. Standard theories of control rights in financial contracting such as Aghion and Bolton (1992) offer little insight into these findings as they neglect asymmetric information. Agency theories that do consider the link between asymmetric information and control, on the other hand, argue that better- informed parties should receive more control in order to avoid information distortion (Dessein (2002)) or to provide better incentives for information acqui- sition (Aghion and Tirole (1997)).

    "abstract": "We present evidence that reassigning tasks among agents can alleviate moral hazard in communication. A rotation policy that routinely reassigns loan ofﬁcers to borrow- ers of a commercial bank affects the ofﬁcers’ reporting behavior. When an ofﬁcer anticipates rotation, reports are more accurate and contain more bad news about the borrower’s repayment prospects. As a result, the rotation policy makes bank lending decisions more sensitive to ofﬁcer reports. The threat of rotation improves communi- cation because self-reporting bad news has a smaller negative effect on an ofﬁcer’s career prospects than bad news exposed by a successor. IN Many Economic Relationships, agents are responsible for self-reporting on the performance of their assigned tasks. Anecdotal and systematic evidence suggest that agents in such relationships hide information that reﬂects poorly on their own performance. For instance, Arthur Andersen was indicted for ob- struction of justice in 2002 for destroying documentation related to its audit of Enron, Lakonishok et al.

    "abstract": "We investigate the role of information in affecting a firm’s cost of capital. We show that differences in the composition of information between public and private information affect the cost of capital, with investors demanding a higher return to hold stocks with greater private information. This higher return arises because informed investors are better able to shift their portfolio to incorporate new information, and uninformed investors are thus disadvantaged. In equilibrium, the quantity and quality of infor- mation affect asset prices. We show firms can influence their cost of capital by choosing features like accounting treatments, analyst coverage, and market microstructure. Fundamental TO A Variety OF Corporate Decisions is a firm’s cost of capital. From determining the hurdle rate for investment projects to influencing the composi- tion of the firm’s capital structure, the cost of capital influences the operations of the firm and its subsequent profitability. Given this importance, it is not sur- prising that a wide range of policy prescriptions has been advanced to help com- panies lower this cost. For example, Arthur Levitt, the former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, suggests that “high quality accounting standards ...improve liquidity [and] reduce capital costs.” 1 The Nasdaq stock market argues that its trading system “most effectively enhances the attrac- tiveness of a company’s stock to investors.” 2 And investment banks routinely solicit u",

    "abstract": "Using a novel no-arbitrage model and extensive second-moment data, we decompose conditional volatility of U.S. Treasury yields into volatilities of short-rate expectations and term premia. Short-rate expectations become more volatile than premia before recessions and during asset market distress. Correlation between shocks to premia and shocks to short-rate expectations is close to zero on average and varies with the monetary policy stance. While Treasuries are nearly unexposed to variance shocks, investors pay a premium for hedging variance risk with derivatives. We illustrate the dynamics of the yield volatility components during and after the ﬁnancial crisis. IN This Paper, WE Characterize THE DYNAMICSof the conditional second moments in the U.S. Treasury market in terms of volatilities of short-rate expectations and term premia, as well as their covariance. A vast literature decomposes the information contained in nominal Treasury yields to study term premia and short-rate expectations. With a few important exceptions,1 much of the recent work has approached this question assuming constant volatility, largely due to tractability and the known difﬁculties with the joint modeling of the ﬁrst and second moments of yields. Consequently, less is known about the economic properties of Treasury market volatility. Intuition suggests, however, that volatility can reveal new information that is hard to extract from yield levels alone. For example, to the extent that expected short",

In the context of 759 earnings announcements, I use intraday transactions data to test the hypothesis that net order flow and returns in the stocks of nonannouncing competitors have information content for announcing firms. HOW Does AN Informed Trader ’S Propensity to trade on inside information in a given company’s stock vary with industry and firm characteristics?

    "abstract": "We find that trading- versus nontrading-period variance ratios in weather-sensitive markets are lower than those in the equity market and higher than those in the cur- rency market. The variance ratios are also substantially lower during periods of the year when prices are most sensitive to the weather. Moreover, the comovement of re- turns and volatilities for related commodities is stronger during the weather-sensitive season, largely due to stronger comovement during nontrading periods. These results are consistent with a strong link between prices and public information flow and cannot be explained by pricing errors or changes in trading activity. A Large Segment OF THE Finance Literature investigates the link between in- formation and prices. Theory suggests that prices are a function of public information and order flow (see, e.g., Grossman and Stiglitz (1980), Kyle (1985), and Glosten and Milgrom (1985)). Order flow is driven by both public and pri- vate information as well as investor shocks, which may be either rational (e.g., noninformation-based liquidity trades) or irrational (e.g., trades based on noise as described by Black (1986)). Prices can deviate from fundamental value due to market microstructure, liquidity, and hedging effects, and pricing errors can arise from noise trading and the systematic underreaction or overreaction to information.

    "title": "Informational Black Holes in Financial Markets",
    "abstract": "We show that information aggregation in primary ﬁnancial markets fails precisely when investors hold socially useful information for screening projects. Being wary of the Winner’s Curse, less optimistic investors refrain from making ﬁnancing offers, since their offers would be accepted only when a project is unviable. Their informa- tion is therefore lost. The Winner’s Curse and associated information loss grow with the number of informed market participants, so that larger markets can lead to worse ﬁnancing decisions and higher cost of capital for ﬁrms seeking ﬁnancing. Precommit- ment to ration fundraising allocations, collusive club bidding, and shorting markets can mitigate the inefﬁciency . THE Main Role OF Primary Financial Markets is to channel resources to ﬁrms with worthwhile projects. This process requires information about demand, technological feasibility , management, and current industry and macroeconomic conditions, as well as views on how to interpret such infor- mation. The efﬁciency of the capital allocation process depends on how well markets aggregate all of this information. Today , a large and growing number of professional investors such as business angels, venture capitalists (VCs), private equity ﬁrms, and traditional commercial banks compete to invest in ﬁrms with good investment opportunities.

    "abstract": "This paper develops a model with a tractable log-linear equilibrium to analyze the effects of informational frictions in commodity markets. By aggregating dispersed information about the strength of the global economy among goods producers whose production has complementarity, commodity prices serve as price signals to guide producers’ production decisions and commodity demand. Our model highlights im- portant feedback effects of informational noise originating from supply shocks and futures market trading on commodity demand and spot prices. Our analysis illus- trates the weakness common in empirical studies on commodity markets of assuming that different types of shocks are publicly observable to market participants. IN THE Aftermath OF THE Dramatic Boom and bust cycle of commodity prices in 2007 to 2008, there has been renewed interest among academics and policy makers regarding the drivers of commodity price ﬂuctuations, in particular, whether fundamental demand and supply shocks are sufﬁcient to explain the observed price cycles and whether speculation in commodity futures markets exacerbated these cycles are subjects of debate. In this debate, it is common for academic and policy studies to treat different types of shocks (such as supply, demand, and ﬁnancial market shocks) as observable to market participants. 1 In doing so, however, these studies ignore a key aspect of commodity mar- kets, namely, severe informational frictions faced by market participants.

    "abstract": "In this paper, I estimate the magnitude of an informational friction limiting credit reallocation to ﬁrms during the 2007 to 2009 ﬁnancial crisis. Because lenders rely on private information when deciding which relationship to end, borrowers looking for a new lender are adversely selected. I show how to separately identify private informa- tion from information common to all lenders but unobservable to the econometrician by using bank shocks within a discrete choice model of relationships. Quantitatively, these informational frictions appear to be too small to explain the credit crunch in the U.S. Syndicated corporate loan market. THE Defining Feature OF Alending relationship between a bank and a borrower is its stickiness: switching lenders is rare and costly.1 In turn, credit markets are more vulnerable: a shock forcing a particular bank to cut lending can have aggregate effects if affected borrowers cannot easily ﬁnd a new lender.2 Understanding why relationships are sticky is important, as it can guide the design of institutions or policies to prevent breakdowns in lending markets. In this paper, I estimate the effects of a key friction behind relationship stickiness: the information gap between a borrower’s existing lender and its potential new lenders. Over the course of a relationship, lenders acquire Markus Brunnermeier, Motohiro Yogo, and Valentin Haddad for their continuous support.

    "title": "Informed Lending and Security Design",
    "abstract": "We examine the role of security design when lenders make inefficient accept or re- ject decisions after screening projects. Lenders may be either “too conservative,” in which case they reject positive-NPV projects, or “too aggressive,” in which case they accept negative-NPV projects. In the first case, the uniquely optimal security is debt. In the second case, it is levered equity. In equilibrium, profitable projects that are relatively likely to break even are financed with debt, while less profitable projects are financed with equity. Highly profitable projects are financed by uninformed arm’s- length lenders. Professional Lenders Have Specialized Expertise in screening projects. Unlike the typical entrepreneur to whom they lend, they have been exposed to a wide variety of projects in the past. Professional lenders have experienced loan of- ficers and analysts who know precisely what information is relevant, how to treat “soft” information such as management quality, and how to weigh the various pieces of information in making a forecast of the project’s cash flows and default risk. This paper examines how securities should be optimally designed when lenders make inefficient accept or reject decisions after screening projects. In our model, screening generates an informative albeit private signal about the project’s profitability. 1 High signals indicate a positive net present value (NPV) and low signals indicate a negative NPV, where the project’s NPV is increasing ful com",

    "abstract": "We train a machine learning method on a class of informed trades to develop a new measure of informed trading, informed trading intensity (ITI). ITI increases before earnings, mergers and acquisitions, and news announcements, and has implications for return reversal and asset pricing. ITI is effective because it captures nonlinear- ities and interactions between informed trading, volume, and volatility. This data- driven approach can shed light on the economics of informed trading, including im- patient informed trading, commonality in informed trading, and models of informed trading. Overall, learning from informed trading data can generate an effective in- formed trading measure. Informed Trading IS AN Important feature of ﬁnancial markets that var- ious academic literatures attempt to account for. For example, informed in- vestors help keep security prices close to fundamental values and thus are cru- cial for theories of market efﬁciency (e.g., Fama (1970); Grossman and Stiglitz (1980)). Models of asset prices also incorporate the effect of informed trad- ing on a ﬁrm’s information structure or liquidity risk (e.g., O’Hara (2003); Kelly and Ljungqvist (2012)). Informed trading is difﬁcult to identify empir- ically , however, because investors’ information sets are not directly observable and because informed investors usually hide behind uninformed order ﬂow. To overcome these challenges, the literature has developed several theory- based measures of informed trading and/",

    "abstract": "This paper characterizes informed trade when speculators can acquire distinct signals of varying quality about an asset’s value at different dates. The most reasonable characterization of private information about stocks is that while information is long- lived, new information will arrive over time, information that may be acquired by others. Hence, while a speculator may know more than others at a moment, in the future, his information will become stale, but not valueless. In an environment that allows for arbitrary correlations among signals, we characterize equilibrium outcomes including trading, prices, and profits. We provide explicit numerical characterizations for different informational environments. ONE OF THE Most Important Open Questions in theoretical market microstructure finance is: How do informed speculators trade in a dynamic environment when different speculators receive distinct signals at different dates? The most interesting and reasonable characterization of private information about stocks is that, while information is long-lived, new information will arrive over time and this information may be acquired by other speculators. In prac- better informed than everyone else with regard to the stock, but he also knows that in the future, his information will become dated, and others will acquire fresher information. Still, the speculator can continue to trade profitably on his information in the future; that is, even though his information will become stale,",

    "abstract": "I examine the possibility of information-based trading in a multiperiod consumption setting. I develop a necessary and sufﬁcient condition for trade to occur. Intertemporal substitution introduces a desire to correlate current consumption with future aggre- gate shocks. When agents have heterogeneous time-inseparable preferences, infor- mation differentially affects relative preferences for current and future consumption, making information-based trading mutually acceptable. The no-trade result contin- ues to hold if there is no aggregate shock, or if agents have either homogeneous or time-separable preferences. Each DAY WE Observe A signiﬁcant volume of trades in the markets. The no- trade theorem, however, has established that when the market is complete for all endowment shocks and agents are rational and share the same prior beliefs, it is impossible to generate trades for purely informational reasons, even in the presence of asymmetric information.1 Because the no-trade theorem serves as a key benchmark in ﬁnancial economics, understanding its scope is important. In this paper, I extend the original single-period consumption no-trade model to multiperiod consumption settings and identify intertemporal consumption smoothing as a mechanism that generates information-based trading. Dynamic consumption extensions are possibly the most natural way to check the robustness of results in a single-period consumption model. In the no-trade literature, however, dynamic consumption",

    "title": "Informed Trading in Stock and Option Markets",
    "abstract": "We investigate the contribution of option markets to price discovery, using a modi- fication of Hasbrouck’s (1995) “information share” approach. Based on five years of stock and options data for 60 firms, we estimate the option market’s contribution to price discovery to be about 17% on average. Option market price discovery is related to trading volume and spreads in both markets, and stock volatility. Price discov- ery across option strike prices is related to leverage, trading volume, and spreads. Our results are consistent with theoretical arguments that informed investors trade in both stock and option markets, suggesting an important informational role for options. Investors WHO Have Access to private information can choose to trade in the stock market or in the options market. Given the high leverage achievable with options and the built-in downside protection, one might think the options market would be an ideal venue for informed trading. If informed traders do trade in the options market, we would expect to seeprice discoveryin the options market. That is, we would expect at least some new information about the stock price to be reflected in option prices first. Establishing that price discovery straddles both the stock and options mar- kets is important for several reasons. In a frictionless, dynamically complete market, options would be redundant securities. This paper contributes to the understanding of why options are relevant in actual markets, by providing the",

    "title": "Infrequent Rebalancing, Return Autocorrelation,",
    "abstract": "A model of infrequent rebalancing can explain speciﬁc predictability patterns in the time series and cross-section of stock returns. First, infrequent rebalancing produces return autocorrelations that are consistent with empirical evidence from intraday returns and new evidence from daily returns. Autocorrelations can switch sign and become positive at the rebalancing horizon. Second, the cross-sectional variance in expected returns is larger when more traders rebalance. This effect generates season- ality in the cross-section of stock returns, which can help explain available empirical evidence. Heston,k Orajczyk, AND Sadka (2010) document a striking pattern of period- icity in intraday returns. Reproducing their main ﬁnding, Figure1 shows that the average estimate from a cross-sectional regression of current half-hour re- turns on lagged half-hour returns spikes at intervals of one trading day for several days. The estimate can be interpreted as the return on a momentum strategy—a high or low return on a stock in a given half-hour interval today can help predict the return on the stock at the same time tomorrow and over the next several days. Changes in trading volume display a periodicity pattern that is similar to that for returns (Heston, Korajczyk, and Sadka (2010)), which suggests that investor trading is a natural candidate to explain the evidence. Motivated by this observation, in this paper I highlight the role of infrequent rebalancing for return and volume periodi",

We find the primary motivation for going public is to facilitate acquisitions. CFOs base IPO timing on overall market conditions, are well informed regarding expected underpricing, and feel underpricing compen- sates investors for taking risk. The most important positive signal is past historical earnings, followed by underwriter certification. CFOs have divergent opinions about the IPO process depending on firm-specific characteristics. Finally, we find the main reason for remaining private is to preserve decision-making control and ownership.

    "abstract": "We examine the asset pricing implications of a production economy whose long-term growth prospects are endogenously determined by innovation and R&D. In equilib- rium, R&D endogenously drives a small, persistent component in productivity that generates long-run uncertainty about economic growth. With recursive preferences, households fear that persistent downturns in economic growth are accompanied by low asset valuations and command high-risk premia in asset markets. Empirically, we ﬁnd substantial evidence for innovation-driven low-frequency movements in ag- gregate growth rates and asset market valuations. In short, equilibrium growth is risky.

At a fundamental level, innovation is a key source of sustained growth in and development (R&D) expenditures, tend to be volatile and quite persistent. Such movements affect the dynamics of growth. Indeed, in U.S. Post-war data, productivity growth exhibits long and persistent swings.1 Similarly, innovation- driven growth waves associated with the arrival of new technologies, such as telecommunication, computers, and the internet, to name a few, are well documented.2 Stock prices reﬂect such changes in growth prospects. Moreover, if agents fear that a persistent slowdown in economic growth will lower asset prices, these movements will give rise to high-risk premia in asset markets.

    "abstract": "We experimentally study the transmission of subjective expectations into actions. Subjects in our experiment report valuations that are far too insensitive to their expectations, relative to the prediction from a frictionless model. We propose that the insensitivity is driven by a noisy cognitive process that prevents subjects from precisely computing asset valuations. The empirical link between subjective expec- tations and actions becomes stronger as subjective expectations approach rational expectations. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating weak transmis- sion into belief-based asset pricing models. Finally, we discuss how cognitive noise can provide a microfoundation for inelastic demand in the stock market. Economists Have Spent THE Past several years using surveys to docu- ment facts about investors’ expectations of stock returns. A clear fact that emerges from this literature is that the subjective expected returns that investors report in surveys depart systematically from objective expected returns (Greenwood and Shleifer ( 2014), Adam and Nagel ( 2023), Nagel and Xu ( 2023)). This fact rejects standard rational expectations models and has motivated a new class of asset pricing theories that aim to match both subjec- tive expectations and realized returns (e.g., Barberis et al.

    "title": "Inside and Outside Information",
    "abstract": "We study an economy with ﬁnancial frictions in which a regulator designs a test that reveals outside information about a ﬁrm’s quality to investors. The ﬁrm can also disclose veriﬁable inside information about its quality . We show that the regulator op- timally aims for “public speech and private silence,” which is achieved with tests that give insiders an incentive to stay quiet. We fully characterize optimal tests by devel- oping tools for Bayesian persuasion with incentive constraints, and use these results to derive novel guidance for the design of bank stress tests, as well as benchmarks for socially optimal corporate credit ratings. During THE Financial Crisis OF 2007 to 2009, regulators such as the Federal Reserve used stress tests to alleviate investors’ uncertainty about the banking system. These stress tests are a form of outside information about ﬁrms that is released to investors. In addition, banks and other ﬁrms have wide discretion over their public corporate disclosures, which reveal inside information to investors. This potential interplay between inside and outside information appears frequently in ﬁnancial markets. For instance, credit ratings agencies provide outside information about borrowers, who can also make their own inside disclosures. In this paper, we analyze how outside information should be designed in an economy with ﬁnancial frictions.

    "title": "Insider Investment Horizon",
    "abstract": "We examine the relation between insiders’ investment horizon and the information content of their trades with respect to future stock returns. We conjecture that an insider’s investment horizon establishes a benchmark for expected patterns of contin- ued trading behavior and thus helps identify unexpected insider trades, which should be more informative in efﬁcient markets. Consistent with this conjecture, the trades of short-horizon insiders are both more unexpected and more informed, on average, than those of long-horizon insiders. Short-horizon insiders and their ﬁrms also tend to display characteristics that are associated with a greater focus on short-termism. A Large Literature Explores HOW the investment horizon of certain groups of investors, such as ﬁnancial institutions, affects corporate policies and stock prices. 1 One particular group of investors whose trades are under scrutiny by regulators and other market participants is corporate insiders.

    "title": "Insider Trading Restrictions and Analysts’",
    "abstract": "Motivated by extant finance theory predicting that insider trading crowds out private information acquisition by outsiders, we use data for 100 countries for the years 1987– 2000 to study whether analyst following in a country increases following restriction of insider trading activities. We document that analyst following increases after initial enforcement of insider trading laws. This increase is concentrated in emerging market countries, but is smaller if the country has previously liberalized its capital market. We also find that analyst following responds less intensely to initial enforcement when a country has a preexisting portfolio of strong investor protections. THE Availability OF Information IS A KEY determinant of the efficiency of resource allocation decisions in economies and their securities markets. There is, how- ever, considerable cross-country variation in the quality and quantity of cor- porate reporting, information intermediation, and information dissemination structures (e.g., Bushman, Piotroski, and Smith (2004)). Hence an important factors determine their evolution over time. In this paper, we focus on one element of information infrastructure, sell- side analysts. We exploit cross-country and intertemporal variation in analyst following for 100 countries for the years 1987–2000 to test the hypothesis that analyst following increases upon the restriction of insider trading. Our analysis specifically tests whether analyst following increases after ado",

    "title": "Insider Trading, News Releases,",
    "abstract": "This paper investigates the market’s reaction to U.K. Insider transactions and ana- lyzes whether the reaction depends on the firm’s ownership. We present three major findings. First, differences in regulation between the U.K. And United States, in par- ticular the speedier reporting of trades in the U.K., may explain the observed larger abnormal returns in the U.K. Second, ownership by directors and outside sharehold- ers has an impact on the abnormal returns. Third, it is important to adjust for news released before directors’ trades. In particular, trades preceded by news on mergers and acquisitions and CEO replacements contain significantly less information. Insiders, That IS , Managers AND Members of the board of directors of publicly traded corporations, usually possess more information about their company than do (small) outside shareholders. The main argument in favor of insider trading is that it communicates this superior information to outsiders. For in- stance, Leland (1992) shows that when insider trading is allowed, share prices incorporate more information, and are higher. However, while an insider pur- chase conveys positive information about the firm’s prospects, it is less clear what information an insider sale conveys. On the one hand, an insider sale may convey unfavorable information about the firm’s prospects. On the other hand, an insider sale may be less informative if it is made to meet the liquidity needs of the seller. Seyhun (1986), Lin and Howe (1",

    "title": "Institutional Allocation in Initial Public",
    "abstract": "We analyze institutional allocation in initial public offerings (IPOs) using a new data set of U.S. Offerings between 1997 and 1998. We document a positive rela- tionship between institutional allocation and day one IPO returns. This is partly explained by the practice of giving institutions more shares in IPOs with strong premarket demand, consistent with book-building theories. However, institutional allocation also contains private information about first-day IPO returns not re- flected in premarket demand and other public information. Our evidence supports book-building theories of IPO underpricing, but suggests that institutional alloca- tion in underpriced issues is in excess of that explained by book-building alone. IT IS Well Known That initial public offerings (IPOs) are underpriced on av- erage. Underpricing is a robust phenomenon that extends across equity mar- kets in several countries and time periods (see, e.g., Loughran, Ritter, and Rydqvist (1994)). For example, in our sample of IPOs offered during 1997- 1998, the average day one return of issues is 19.25 percent. In these offer- ings, the total money \"left on the table\" due to underpricing is a substantial $3.5 billion.1 While the existence of these initial gains is widely known and how these gains are divided between different investors in IPOs. IPO underwriters play a central role in determining the division of first day gains between different investors. Underwriters possess substantial in- formation about",

    "title": "Institutional Holdings and Payout Policy",
    "abstract": "We examine the relation between institutional holdings and payout policy in U.S. Public firms. We find that payout policy affects institutional holdings. Institutions avoid firms that do not pay dividends. However, among dividend-paying firms they prefer firms that pay fewer dividends. Our evidence indicates that institutions pre- fer firms that repurchase shares, and regular repurchasers over nonregular repur- chasers. Higher institutional holdings or a concentration of holdings do not cause firms to increase their dividends, their repurchases, or their total payout. Our results do not support models that predict that high dividends attract institutional clientele, or models that predict that institutions cause firms to increase payout. Institutional Investors ARE ONE OF THE Major Investor Groups in the United States. In 1996, institutions held more than 50% of the equity of U.S. Industrial firms, compared to around 35% a decade earlier. There is a trend toward more institutional holdings in both small and large firms. How institutional investors affect corporate financial policies and, conse- quently, corporate value, is an important question that receives more attention these days from both academics and practitioners. In this paper, we investigate one aspect of this question, the relation between institutional ownership and payout policy. We derive implications of theories that relate a firm’s payout pol- icy to investors’ characteristics and test these hypotheses on a la",

    "title": "Institutional Investors and Corporate",
    "abstract": "This paper studies institutional investors’ incentives to be engaged shareholders. In 2017, the average institution gains an extra $129,000 in annual management fees if a stockholding increases 1% in value, considering both the direct effect on assets under management and the indirect effect on subsequent fund ﬂows. The estimates range from $19,600 for investments in small ﬁrms to $307,600 for investments in large ﬁrms. Institutional shareholders in one ﬁrm often gain when the ﬁrm’s competitors do well, by virtue of institutions’ holdings in those ﬁrms, but the impact of common ownership is modest in the most concentrated industries. This Paper Studies Institutional Investors ’ ﬁnancial incentives to be engaged shareholders. Institutional ownership of publicly traded U.S. ﬁrms rose from 32% to 73% of the overall market from 1980 to 2017, according to 13F ﬁlings with the SEC, and the 100 largest institutions now own more than 50% of all equity. This shift in ownership has the potential to substantially affect the governance of public ﬁrms if institutional investors have different incentives than other shareholders. Institutions have traditionally been viewed as passive owners, raising con- cerns that their growth will weaken governance and exacerbate agency prob- lems (Bebchuk, Cohen, and Hirst ( 2017)). However, recent studies provide ev- idence that larger institutions often exercise “voice” through proxy voting and behind-the-scenes engagement with management (Carleton, Nel",

    "abstract": "We find that institutional ownership concentration is positively related to the pay-for-p er formance sensitivity of executive compensation and negatively re- lated to the level of compensation, even after controlling for firm size, indus- try, investment opportunities, and performance. These results suggest that the institutions serve a monitoring role in mitigating the agency problem between shareholders and managers. Additionally, we find that clientele effects exist among institutions for firms with certain compensation structures, suggest- ing that institutions also influence compensation structures through their preferences. While institutions' ownership of corporations has grown over the last few dec- ades, their importance in monitoring corporate behavior is still unknown. In this study, we examine whether institutional investors influence corporate govern- ance by studying the relation between institutional ownership and the compen- sation of firms' executives. Both practitioners and theoreticians have suggested a relation between institutional ownership and executive compensation. Incentive effects vary with different forms of compensation (e.g., Holmstrom (1979) and Shavell (1979)), and public fund managers have often voiced their opinions that managerial compensation should be linked to corporate performance (e.g., Smith (1996) and Gillan and Starks (2000)).

    "abstract": "Recent studies show that single-quarter institutional herding positively predicts short-term returns. Motivated by the theoretical herding literature, which empha- sizes endogenous persistence in decisions over time, we estimate the effect of mul- tiquarter institutional buying and selling on stock returns. Using both regression and portfolio tests, we ﬁnd that persistent institutional trading negatively predicts long-term returns: persistently sold stocks outperform persistently bought stocks at long horizons. The negative association between returns and institutional trade persistence is not subsumed by past returns or other stock characteristics, is con- centrated among smaller stocks, and is stronger for stocks with higher institutional ownership. A Growing Literature ON THE trading behavior of institutional money man- agers shows that they exhibit a tendency to herd, that is, to imitate each others’ trades. Given the increasing prevalence of such investors in ﬁnancial markets, the potential price impact of institutional herding is of great interest. Institutional herding behavior is generally found to have a stabilizing effect on prices. Several well-known studies ﬁnd a positive correlation between the di- rection of institutional herding and future stock returns, thus concluding that institutional trading pushes prices towards equilibrium values. For example, Wermers (1999) shows that stocks heavily bought by mutual funds during a given quarter outperform stocks heavily",

    "abstract": "We argue and demonstrate empirically that a ﬁrm’s institutional and legal context has ﬁrst-order effects in tests that use state antitakeover laws for identiﬁcation. A priori, the size and direction of a law’s effect on a ﬁrm’s takeover protection depends on (i) other state antitakeover laws, (ii) preexisting ﬁrm-level takeover defenses, and (iii) the legal regime as reﬂected by important court decisions. In addition, (iv) state antitakeover laws are not exogenous for many easily identiﬁable ﬁrms. We show that the inferences from nine prior studies related to nine different outcome variables change substantially when we include controls for these considerations. (1950) points out, the economic environment tends to select the combination of ﬁrm characteristics—including organization, ﬁnancing, payout policy, own- ership structure, board structure, compensation, and governance—that mini- mize total production costs. This implies that each ﬁrm’s characteristics and performance are endogenous outcomes of the competitive process. Researchers nonetheless seek to explore questions of causality. For example, does better governance improve ﬁrm value, innovation, or payout policy? To address endogeneity issues, researchers frequently investigate ﬁrm char- acteristics around regulatory changes or court decisions that exogenously affect ﬁrms’ costs or governance. For example, previous studies use banking dereg- ulations to examine innovation and economic growth (Bertrand, Schoar, and of",

    "abstract": "This paper develops a comprehensive framework to address uncertainty about the correct factor model. Asset pricing inferences draw on a composite model that in- tegrates over competing factor models weighted by posterior probabilities. Evidence shows that unconditional models record near-zero probabilities, while postearnings announcement drift, quality-minus-junk, and intermediary capital are potent factors in conditional asset pricing. Out-of-sample, the integrated model performs well, tilt- ing away from subsequently underperforming factors. Model uncertainty makes eq- uities appearconsiderably riskier, while model disagreement about expected returns spikes during crash episodes. Disagreement spans all return components involving mispricing, factor loadings, and risk premia. Financial Economists Have Identified A Plethora of ﬁrm characteris- tics that predict future stock returns (e.g., Cochrane (2011) and Harvey, Liu, and Zhu (2016)). The literature has further proposed two major approaches to reduce the expanding number of predictors. The ﬁrst invokes economic ra- tionales, for example, plausible restrictions on the admissible Sharpe ratio, the present-value model, and theq-theory, to identify a small set of common factors, while the second approach formulates the dependence of average re- turns on common factors or ﬁrm characteristics through regression regular- ization techniques including deep learning extensions.

    "abstract": "Informational scope economies provide a cost advantage to universal banks offering \"one-stop shopping\" for lending and underwriting that enables them to \"lock in\" their clients' subsequent business. This market power reduces uni- versal banks' incentive, relative to that of specialized investment banks, to ap- ply costly underwriting efforts; consequently, universal banks are less successful in selling their clients' securities. Our results suggest that an inte- grated financial services market is less innovative than one with specialized intermediaries. Our analysis also identifies economy, intermediary, and firm characteristics that motivate either the integration or segmentation of bank lending and underwriting. THE Glass-steagall ACT of 1933, which had long segmented the financial ser- vices industry in the United States, was eliminated on November 12, 1999, when then President Clinton signed into law the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, otherwise known as the Banking Modernization Bill.

    "abstract": "Using 3 years of interest rate caps price data, we provide a comprehensive documenta- tion of volatility smiles in the caps market. To capture the volatility smiles, we develop a multifactor term structure model with stochastic volatility and jumps that yields a closed-form formula for cap prices. We show that although a three-factor stochastic volatility model can price at-the-money caps well, significant negative jumps in inter- est rates are needed to capture the smile. The volatility smile contains information that is not available using only at-the-money caps, and this information is important for understanding term structure models. THE Extensive Literature ON Multifactor Dynamic term structure models (here- after, DTSMs) of the last decade mainly focuses on explaining bond yields and swap rates (see Dai and Singleton (2003) and Piazzesi (2003) for surveys of the literature). The pricing and hedging of over-the-counter interest rate derivatives such as caps and swaptions has attracted attention only recently. World-wide, caps and swaptions are among the most widely traded interest rate derivatives. According to the Bank for International Settlements, in re- cent years, their combined notional value exceeds 10 trillion dollars, which is many times larger than that of exchange-traded options. The accurate and efficient pricing and hedging of caps and swaptions is therefore of enormous practical importance. Moreover, because cap and swaption prices may contain information",

    "abstract": "Conditional skewness of Treasury yields is an important indicator of the risks to the macroeconomic outlook. Positive skewness signals upside risk to interest rates dur- ing periods of accommodative monetary policy and an upward-sloping yield curve, and vice versa. Skewness has substantial predictive power for future bond excess returns, high-frequency interest rate changes around Federal Open Market Com- mittee announcements, and survey forecast errors for interest rates. The estimated expectational errors, or biases in beliefs, are quantitatively important for statistical bond risk premia. These ﬁndings are consistent with a heterogeneous-beliefs model in which one of the agents is wrong about consumption growth. Predicting Bond Returns AND Changes in interest rates is a key chal- lenge for ﬁnancial economists, investors, and policymakers. Conditional skew- ness of interest rates is a natural candidate for a useful predictor. In contrast to measures of uncertainty or volatility , skewness contains information about the likely direction of future rate changes because it measures asymmetry and the balance of interest rate risks. This paper demonstrates that conditional skewness of Treasury yields is important for understanding yield dynamics and bond risk premia. We study model-free measures of skewness, focusing on forward-looking skewness implied by Treasury option prices. Over the last three decades, conditional interest rate skewness has exhibited pronounced cyclical vari",

The effect is stronger for high-quality ﬁrms and for loans extended by interlocked banks with a large joint market share. Interest rates on loans from previously interlocked banks become more dispersed. Finally, ﬁrms borrowing more from previously interlocked banks expand investment, employment, and sales.

    "abstract": "Intermediaries such as ﬁnancial advisers serve as an interface between portfolio man- agers and investors. A large fraction of their compensation is often provided through kickbacks from the portfolio manager. We provide an explanation for the widespread use of intermediaries and kickbacks. Depending on the degree of investor sophisti- cation, kickbacks are used either for price discrimination or aggressive marketing. We explore the effects of these arrangements on fund size, ﬂows, performance, and investor welfare. Kickbacks allow higher management fees to be charged, thereby low- ering net returns. Competition among active portfolio managers reduces kickbacks and increases the independence of advisory services. THE Money Management Industry has been recognized as having substan- tial inﬂuence on ﬁnancial markets. The Investment Adviser Association es- timates the total amount of assets managed by investment advisers regis- tered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to be $42.3 trillion at its peak in April 2008. 1 An important reason for the enormous size of the money management business is that there are often multiple layers of advisory services between investors and the ultimate portfolio manager. In many cases, investors do not delegate their wealth directly to money man- agers, but rather rely on intermediaries. Examples of such intermediaries include ﬁnancial advisers who manage separate accounts for their clients, We also appreciate helpful discussi",

    "abstract": "We explain why banks and nonbank intermediaries coexist in a model based only on differences in their funding costs. Banks enjoy a low cost of capital due to safety nets and money-like liabilities. We show that this can actually be a disadvantage: it gen- erates a soft-budget-constraint problem that makes it difﬁcult for banks to credibly threaten to withhold additional funding to failed projects. Nonbanks emerge to solve this problem. Their high cost of capital is an advantage: it allows them to commit to terminate funding. Still, nonbanks never take over the entire market, but other coexist with banks in equilibrium. Depository Financial Institutions —“ Banks ”— Have a low cost of cap- ital,1 arguably because their liabilities beneﬁt from a moneyness premium and government safety nets. Perhaps, due to this funding cost advantage over nonbanks, banks provided the bulk of ﬁnance until the late 1970s, when deregulation removed barriers to entry .

    "abstract": "This paper examines capital reallocation among ﬁrms in Korean business groups (chaebol) in the aftermath of the 1997 Asian ﬁnancial crisis, and the consequences of this capital reallocation for the investment and performance ofchaebolﬁrms. We show that chaebol transferred cash from low-growth to high-growth member ﬁrms, using cross-ﬁrm equity investments. This capital reallocation allowedchaebol ﬁrms with greater investment opportunities to invest more than control ﬁrms after the crisis. These ﬁrms also showed higher proﬁtability and lower declines in valuation than control ﬁrms following the crisis. Our results suggest thatchaebol internal capital markets helped them mitigate the negative effects of the Asian crisis on investment and performance. The literature on internal capital markets focuses mostly on multisegment ﬁrms (conglomerates), which are common in the United States. A “business group”—a group of legally independent ﬁrms under common ownership— shares many of the features of U.S.-type conglomerates. In particular, both have internal markets that can allocate capital among member ﬁrms and divi- sions. While the importance of internal capital allocation within conglomerates has probably decreased in the United States as a result of ﬁnancial develop- ment, the role of groups may still be signiﬁcant in countries with weak institu- tions and less developed ﬁnancial markets (Khanna and Palepu (2000), Morck, Wolfenzon, and Yeung (2005), Khanna and Yafeh (2007)).

    "title": "Internal Capital Markets in Financial",
    "abstract": "This paper looks at internal capital markets in financial conglomerates by com- paring the responses of small subsidiary and independent banks to monetary pol- icy. I find that internal capital markets in financial conglomerates relax the credit constraints faced by smaller bank affiliates. Further analysis indicates that those markets lessen the impact of Fed policies on bank lending activity. The paper also examines the role of internal capital markets in influencing the investment allo- cation process of those conglomerates. My findings suggest that frictions between conglomerate headquarters and external capital markets are at the root of invest- ment inefficiencies generated by internal capital markets. Markets in influencing conglomerate investment. One line of argument, put forth by Alchian (1969) and Weston (1970), and extended by Gertner, Scharf- stein, and Stein (1994) and Stein (1997), stresses the potential efficiency- enhancing role of internal capital markets. These markets can be useful in reducing information asymmetries between project managers and investors, and in providing for better allocation of funds across projects within the markets can hinder investment efficiency. Scharfstein and Stein (2000) and Rajan, Servaes, and Zingales (2000), among others, emphasize the potential for agency problems and power grabbing to generate inefficient subsidiza- tion across projects. Whether internal capital markets enhance or hinder investment efficiency has become an",

    "abstract": "We report evidence on chief executive officer ~CEO! Turnover during the 1971 to 1994 period. We find that the nature of CEO turnover activity has changed over time. The frequencies of forced CEO turnover and outside succession both in- creased. However, the relation between the likelihood of forced CEO turnover and firm performance did not change significantly from the beginning to the end of the period we examine, despite substantial changes in internal governance mecha- nisms. The evidence also indicates that changes in the intensity of the takeover market are not associated with changes in the sensitivity of CEO turnover to firm performance. Stockholders Rely ON Internal AND External monitoring mechanisms to help resolve agency problems that arise from the separation of ownership and control in modern corporations. Boards of directors and blockholders are im- portant internal control mechanisms whereas the takeover market is a ma- jor source of external control. Both academicians and practitioners have speculated that improvements in corporate governance structures would en- hance the internal control mechanisms. For example, Jensen ~1993! Argues that the corporate governance structures of LBO associations and venture capital funds should be models for corporations that desire more efficient control systems. Among the desirable features Jensen points to are smaller, outsider-dominated boards, and substantial equity ownership by managers and board members. Similarly, Blair",

    "title": "Internal versus External Financing: An Optimal",
    "abstract": "We study optimal financial contracting for centralized and decentralized firms. Under centralized contracting, headquarters raises funds on behalf of multiple projects. Under decentralized contracting, each project raises funds separately on the external capital market. The benefit of centralization is that headquar- ters can use excess liquidity from high cash-flow projects to buy continuation rights for low cash-flow projects. The cost is that headquarters may pool cash flows from several projects and self-finance follow-up investments without hav- ing to return to the capital market. Absent any capital market discipline, it is more difficult to force headquarters to make repayments, which tightens finan- cing constraints ex ante. Cross-sectionally, our model implies that conglomer- ates should have a lower average productivity than stand-alone firms. Beginning With Fazzari, Hubbard, AND Petersen (1988), several studies document that the investment behavior of firms is affected by financing constraints.1 In this paper, we explore the relation between financing constraints and organizational structure. Specifically, we ask whether centralized firms where headquarters raises funds on behalf of multiple projects face tighter or looser financing con- straints than stand-alone firms. The internal capital markets literature provides some hints on the role of orga- nizational structure for financing constraints. There, headquarters either adds or destroys value, for example, by en",

    "abstract": "Focusing on data from the United States and the United Kingdom, we document that both the anomaly identiﬁed by Backus and Smith, which concerns the low correlation between consumption differentials and exchange rates, and the forward premium anomaly, which concerns the tendency of high interest rate currencies to appreciate, have become more severe over time. Taking into account different capital mobility regimes, we show that these anomalies turn into general equilibrium regularities in a two-country and two-good economy with Epstein and Zin preferences, frictionless markets, and correlated long-run growth prospects. TWO OF THE Best -established empirical facts in international ﬁnance are the tendency of high interest rate currencies to appreciate (the forward pre- mium anomaly, Fama (1984)), and the lack of correlation between consump- tion growth differentials and exchange rate movements (the Backus and Smith (1993) anomaly). The former contradicts the logic of the basic uncov- ered interest rate parity (UIP) relationship, while the latter is at odds with the condition impelled by any model with standard time-additive preferences and complete markets. Less well known is the dramatic change in the behavior of these empirical anomalies before and after the early 1970s. The United States and the United Kingdom, two countries with a long history of reliable macroeconomic and ﬁnancial data that we employ in our empirical analysis, offer a prime example of this.

    "title": "International Cross-Listing, Firm Performance,",
    "abstract": "We examine a primary outcome of corporate governance, namely, the ability to iden- tify and terminate poorly performing CEOs, to test the effectiveness of U.S. Investor protections in improving the corporate governance of cross-listed firms. We find that firms from weak investor protection regimes that are cross-listed on a major U.S. Ex- change are more likely to terminate poorly performing CEOs than non-cross-listed firms. Cross-listings on exchanges that do not require the adoption of stringent in- vestor protections (OTC, private placements, and London listings) are not associated with a higher propensity to remove poorly performing CEOs. Does Cross -listing IN THE United States Improve the corporate governance of foreign firms? The “bonding hypothesis” proposed by Coffee (1999, 2002) and Stulz (1999) predicts that after listing on a major U.S. Stock exchange, foreign firms become subject to stringent U.S. Investor protections that constrain in- siders from expropriating minority shareholders. Because this hypothesis has important implications for the effectiveness of U.S. Laws and enforcement as well as the efficacy of market-based approaches in improving global corporate governance, it has attracted the recent attention of academics and practitioners alike. To date, empirical support for the bonding hypothesis is principally drawn from the large literature that examines the economic consequences of cross- listing in the United States. 1 However, as Leuz (2006) notes, th",

    "title": "International Evidence on Institutional Trading",
    "abstract": "This study characterizes institutional trading in international stocks from 37 coun- tries during 1997 to 1998 and 2001. We find that the underlying market condition is a major determinant of the price impact and, more importantly, of the asymme- try between price impacts of institutional buy and sell orders. In bullish markets, institutional purchases have a bigger price impact than sells; however, in the bearish markets, sells have a higher price impact. This differs from previous findings on price impact asymmetry. Our study further suggests that price impact varies depending on order characteristics, firm-specific factors, and cross-country differences. Cross-border Investment has increased dramatically during the past 20 years and has become a crucial element in modern portfolios of investors worldwide. While individual investors typically diversify their portfolios through mutual funds and American Depository Receipts, large institutional investors such as mutual funds and pension funds often transact directly in international markets for their portfolio needs. Investing directly in international stocks in- volves unique risks, challenges, and costs. 1 Whereas the tradeoffs between these unique risks and returns from international investments have been widely studied, the transaction costs, particularly price impact costs, can potentially be another critical component of a successful international portfolio strategy. This is especially important for active institutional",

    "title": "International Stock Return Comovements",
    "abstract": "We examine international stock return comovements using country-industry and country-style portfolios as the base portfolios. We first establish that parsimonious risk-based factor models capture the data covariance structure better than the popu- lar Heston–Rouwenhorst (1994) model. We then establish the following stylized facts regarding stock return comovements. First, there is no evidence for an upward trend in return correlations, except for the European stock markets. Second, the increasing im- portance of industry factors relative to country factors was a short-lived phenomenon. Third, large growth stocks are more correlated across countries than are small value stocks, and the difference has increased over time. THE Study OF comovements between stock returns is at the heart of finance and has recently received much interest in a variety of literatures, especially in international finance. First, recent articles such as Cavaglia, Brightman, and Aked (2000) have challenged the classic result from Heston and Rouwenhorst (1994) that country factors are more important drivers of volatility and co- movements than are industry factors. If true, there are important implications for asset management and the benefits of international diversification. Sec- ond, it is generally believed that increased capital market integration should go hand-in-hand with increased cross-country correlations.

    "abstract": "We investigate lead-lag relationships among monthly country stock returns and iden- tify a leading role for the United States: lagged U.S. Returns signiﬁcantly predict re- turns in numerous non-U.S. Industrialized countries, while lagged non-U.S. Returns display limited predictive ability with respect to U.S. Returns. We estimate a news- diffusion model, and the results indicate that return shocks arising in the United States are only fully reﬂected in equity prices outside of the United States with a lag, consistent with a gradual information diffusion explanation of the predictive power of lagged U.S. Returns. Although Some Controversy Remains , stock return predictability in the United States and other industrialized countries appears well established. For example, Fama and Schwert (1977), Campbell (1987), Breen, Glosten, and Ja- gannathan (1989), Fama and French (1988, 1989), Ferson and Harvey (1991), Lettau and Ludvigson (2001), Cochrane (2008), and P´astor and Stambaugh (2009) provide evidence for the United States, while Cutler, Poterba, and Summers (1991), Harvey (1991), Bekaert and Hodrick (1992), Ferson and Harvey (1993), Solnik (1993), Ang and Bekaert (2007), and Hjalmarsson (2010) provide international evidence.

    "abstract": "We show that the parent-subsidiary structure of multinational firms created by cross- border mergers and acquisitions is affected by the prospect of international double taxation. Specifically, the likelihood of parent firm location in a country following a cross-border takeover is reduced by high international double taxation of foreign- source income. At the same time, countries with high international double taxation attract smaller numbers of parent firms. A unilateral elimination of worldwide tax- ation by the United States is simulated to increase the proportion of parent firms locating in the United States following cross-border mergers and acquisitions from 53% to 58%. A Multinational Typically has a parent firm in one country and subsidiaries in one or more foreign countries. In this setting, the location of the parent firm generally affects the taxes due in the parent country and all the other countries. Some parent countries tax the worldwide income of their resident multinationals, whereas other countries exempt the foreign-source income of their multinationals from domestic taxation. A multinational firm with a tax residence in a country that imposes worldwide taxation risks being subject to international double taxation on income generated outside the parent country.

    "abstract": "The currency depreciation rate is often computed as the ratio of foreign to domestic pricing kernels. Using bond prices alone to estimate these kernels leads to currency puzzles: the inability of models to match violations of uncovered interest parity and the volatility of exchange rates. This happens because of theFX bond disconnect, the inability of bonds to span exchange rates. Incorporating innovations to the pric- ing kernel that affect exchange rates but not bonds helps resolve the puzzles. This approach also allows one to relate news about cross-country differences between in- ternational yields to news about currency risk premiums. Through the lens of pricing kernels. Backus, Foresi, and Telmer (2001)( B / F / T hereafter) show that with complete markets, currency depreciation rates equal the ratio of the two pricing kernels. Building on this observation, the asset market view (AMV) of exchange rates treats dynamic pricing kernels as prim- itives (Brandt, Cochrane, and Santa-Clara (2006)). Dynamic (i.e., conditional) pricing kernels are speciﬁed and estimated, with the goal of producing plau- sible exchange rate dynamics. The AMV approach has become the dominant paradigm in international ﬁnancial economics. The challenge in the AMV literature is to match observed exchange rate dy- namics with those implied by the two estimated pricing kernels. Results hinge on both the functional forms for pricing kernels and the data used in estima- tion. Conditional pricing kernels",

    "title": "Interpreting Factor Models",
    "abstract": "We argue that tests of reduced-form factor models and horse races between “character- istics” and “covariances” cannot discriminate between alternative models of investor beliefs. Since asset returns have substantial commonality, absence of near-arbitrage opportunities implies that the stochastic discount factor can be represented as a func- tion of a few dominant sources of return variation. As long as some arbitrageurs are present, this conclusion applies even in an economy in which all cross-sectional vari- ation in expected returns is caused by sentiment. Sentiment-investor demand results in substantial mispricing only if arbitrageurs are exposed to factor risk when taking the other side of these trades. Reduced-form Factor Models ARE ubiquitous in empirical asset pricing. In these models, the stochastic discount factor (SDF) is represented as a func- such as the three-factor SDF of Fama and French ( 1993) and various exten- sions are popular with academics and practitioners alike. These models are reduced-form because they are not derived from assumptions about investor beliefs, preferences, and technology that prescribe which factors should appear in the SDF. What interpretation should one give such a model if it works well empirically? That there exists a factor representation of the SDF is almost a tautology. 1 The economic content of the factor-model evidence lies in the fact that not only do covariances with the factors explain the cross section of expected returns,",

IN THE Modern Financial System , coordination failures among investors and ﬁnancial institutions can lead to self-fulﬁlling, panic-based “runs” that threaten the system’s stability and generate huge welfare losses.1 Policy- makers worldwide have therefore devoted considerable effort and resources to intervention programs that aim to prevent panic among investors. For instance, during the Great Recession of 2007 to 2008, governments provided ﬁnancial institutions with loans, explicit and implicit guarantees, and capital injections. While these policies proved to be effective at restoring ﬁnancial stability , they were criticized on two grounds.

    "abstract": "Motivated by the literature on investment ﬂows and optimal trading, we examine in- traday predictability in the cross-section of stock returns. We ﬁnd a striking pattern of return continuation at half-hour intervals that are exact multiples of a trading day, and this effect lasts for at least 40 trading days. Volume, order imbalance, volatility, and bid-ask spreads exhibit similar patterns, but do not explain the return patterns. We also show that short-term return reversal is driven by temporary liquidity im- balances lasting less than an hour and bid-ask bounce. Timing trades can reduce execution costs by the equivalent of the effective spread. WE Postulate That systematic trading and institutional fund ﬂows lead to predictable patterns in trading volume and order imbalances among common stocks. If these patterns are fully anticipated, then they should not cause pre- dictability in stock returns. Yet, we ﬁnd periodicity in the cross-section of stock returns. To study the nature of intraday periodicity we divide the trading day into 13 half-hour trading intervals. A stock’s return over a given trading in- terval is negatively related to its returns over recent intervals, consistent with the negative autocorrelation induced by bid-ask bounce and lack of resiliency in markets. However, there is a statistically signiﬁcant positive relation between a stock’s return over a given interval and its subsequent returns at daily fre- quencies (i.e., lags of 13, 26, 39,... , periods).

This paper empirically investigates price discovery in this environment. For the S&P 500 and Nasdaq- 100 indexes, most of the price discovery occurs in the E-mini market. For the S&P 400 MidCap index, price discovery is shared between the regular futures contract and the ETF. The S&P 500 ETF contributes markedly to price dis- covery in the sector ETFs, but there are only minor effects in the reverse direction. This paper is an empirical study of the short-run price dynamics in three important U.S. Equity index markets (S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, and Nasdaq-100). Tradi- tionally these markets have been viewed as principally comprising floor-traded index futures contracts and the underlying spot or cash markets, consisting of the individual markets for the component stocks. Against this backdrop, the pre- sent paper is motivated by the relatively recent emergence of: • Exchange-traded index mutual funds (ETFs), which permit the direct pur- chase or sale of an index portfolio at any time. • Electronically-traded index futures contracts. • Exchange-traded S&P 500 index sector funds, which decompose the overall index into industry components.

    "abstract": "This paper highlights the simple fact that households typically consist of multiple members who may hold divergent views, a fact that existing approaches to mea- suring and modeling household macroeconomic expectations largely abstract from. Using unique data on the macroeconomic expectations of both spouses, I document substantial intrahousehold disagreement about inﬂation, economic recessions, and stock market returns. I further show that household asset allocation decisions are shaped by disagreement between spouses about future stock returns, and a prereg- istered randomized survey experiment conﬁrms the causal impact of such disagree- ment on portfolio choice. Economists Have Long Recognized THE critical role of household expec- tations in determining macroeconomic outcomes (e.g., Keynes (1936)). For decades, full-information rational expectations have been the dominant as- using survey data on households’ subjective expectations, leading to the development of a range of alternative models (e.g., Coibion, Gorodnichenko, and Kamdar (2018), Bordalo, Gennaioli, and Shleifer (2022)).

    "title": "Inventory Management, Dealers’ Connections,",
    "abstract": "We propose a new model of trading in over-the-counter markets. Dealers accumulate inventories by trading with end-investors and trade among each other to reduce their inventory holding costs. Core dealers use a more efﬁcient trading technology than peripheral dealers, who are heterogeneously connected to core dealers and trade with each other bilaterally . Connectedness affects prices and allocations if and only if the peripheral dealers’ aggregate inventory position differs from zero. Price dispersion increases in the size of this position. The model generates new predictions about the effects of dealers’ connectedness and dealers’ aggregate inventories on prices. Many Assets (fixed Income Securities , securitizations, currencies, etc.) trade in over-the-counter (OTC) markets. Given their size and economic func- tion, understanding the process of price formation and liquidity provision in these markets is important. Dealers play the lead role in this process, set- ting prices at which investors can immediately execute their trades. As a result, they build up substantial inventory positions. Recent evidence shows that inventory holding costs have signiﬁcant liquidity and price effects in OTC markets. For instance, Friewald and Nagler (2019) ﬁnd that these costs Jean-Edouard Colliard and Thierry Foucault are at HEC Paris. Peter Hoffmann is at the Eu- ropean Central Bank.

    "abstract": "We examine how the evidence of predictability in asset returns affects optimal portfolio choice for investors with long horizons. Particular attention is paid to estimation risk, or uncertainty about the true values of model parameters. We find that even after incorporating parameter uncertainty, there is enough predictability in returns to make investors allocate substantially more to stocks, the longer their horizon. Moreover, the weak statistical significance of the evidence for predictabil- ity makes it important to take estimation risk into account; a long-horizon investor who ignores it may overallocate to stocks by a sizeable amount. The evidence of predictability in asset returns.1 In this paper we examine the implications of this predictability for an investor seeking to make sensible portfolio allocation decisions. We approach this question from the perspective of horizon effects: Given the evidence of predictability in returns, should a long-horizon investor al- locate his wealth differently from a short-horizon investor? The motivation for thinking about the problem in these terms is the classic work of Sam- uelson (1969) and Merton (1969). They show that if asset returns are i.i.d., an investor with power utility who rebalances his portfolio optimally should choose the same asset allocation, regardless of investment horizon. In light of the growing body of evidence that returns are predictable, the rizon does play a role serves as an interesting and convenient wa",

These findings suggest that banks’ underwriting decisions reflect repu- tation concerns, and are thus informative of issue quality. They also suggest that economic rents are earned on reputation, and thereby provide continued incentives for underwriters to maintain reputation. INC Apital Markets, Investment Banks Play the important role of bridging firms that need capital with investors that seek investment opportunities. Interme- diation services are valuable first because the banks’ specialization in the sales and marketing of securities helps lower the issuers’transactional costs of bor- rowing. But perhaps more importantly, investment banks can provide value through their role in lowering the issuers’ informational cost of capital. This role arises from the information asymmetry that typically exists between insid- ers (the issuing firms) and outsiders (the investors) in security issuance events. Such an information gap, as Akerlof demonstrated in his classic 1970 paper, at best causes investors to discount the securities, and at worst can threaten the exi",

    "abstract": "This paper examines investment choices of nonproﬁt hospitals. It tests how shocks to cash ﬂows caused by the performance of the hospitals’ ﬁnancial assets affect hos- pital expenditures. Capital expenditures increase, on average, by 10 to 28 cents for every dollar received from ﬁnancial assets. The sensitivity is similar to that found earlier for shareholder-owned corporations. Executive compensation, other salaries, and perks do not respond signiﬁcantly to cash ﬂow shocks. Hospitals with an apparent tendency to overspend on medical procedures do not exhibit higher investment-cash ﬂow sensitivities. The sensitivities are higher for hospitals that appear ﬁnancially constrained. More Than 20% OF U.S. Corporations are nonproﬁt entities, yet this organiza- tional form has received almost no attention in corporate ﬁnance. Nonproﬁts dominate the healthcare space, which constitutes more than 15% of the U.S. Political debate. Hospitals are part of this debate as they account for approxi- mately 30% of all expenditures in healthcare.1 However, understanding invest- ment decisions of a nonproﬁt hospital is challenging because standard ﬁnance corporations, and their insights are not necessarily applicable to nonproﬁts. Nonproﬁts differ from for-proﬁts in fundamental ways. While the objective function of a for-proﬁt (in the absence of frictions) is to maximize shareholder value, nonproﬁts do not have shareholders, and their stated objectives in- clude serving donors, community, or the so",

    "abstract": "When the discount rate falls, investment should rise. Thus with time-varying dis- count rates and instantly changing investment, investment should positively co- vary with current stock returns and negatively covary with future stock returns. Aggregate nonresidential U.S. Investment contradicts both these implications, prob- ably because of investment lags. Investment plans, however, satisfy both implica- tions. These investment plans, from a U.S. Government survey of firms, are highly informative measures of expected investment and explain more than three- quarters of the variation in real annual aggregate investment growth. Plans have substantial forecasting power for excess stock returns, showing that time-varying risk premia affect investment. A Basic Idea IN Economics and finance is that when the discount rate falls, investment should rise. If discount rates move over time and investment instantly adjusts, then the idea has two implications. First, investment and stock returns should positively covary over time. This positive contempora- neous covariation occurs because when discount rates fall, firms increase investment (since the hurdle rate on investment falls) and stock prices rise (since the discounted sum of future cash flows rises). Second, investment and future stock returns should negatively covary over time. This negative covariation occurs because when discount rates are low, investment today is high and future expected returns are low. Post-war annual aggrega",

Capital expenditures decline with mandatory contributions to DB pen- sion plans, even when controlling for correlations between the pension funding status itself and the firm’s unobserved investment opportunities.

These contributions have a direct impact on a company’s internal financial resources. If a firm is financially constrained, contribution requirements may (R&D), and make acquisitions.

    "title": "Investment, Idiosyncratic Risk, and Ownership",
    "abstract": "High-powered incentives may induce higher managerial effort, but they also expose managers to idiosyncratic risk. If managers are risk averse, they might underinvest when ﬁrm-speciﬁc uncertainty increases, leading to suboptimal investment decisions from the perspective of well-diversiﬁed shareholders. We empirically document that, when idiosyncratic risk rises, ﬁrm investment falls, and more so when managers own a larger fraction of the ﬁrm. This negative effect of managerial risk aversion on investment is mitigated if executives are compensated with options rather than with shares or if institutional investors form a large part of the shareholder base. IN Frictionless Capital Markets, only the systematic component of risk is rele- vant for investment decisions. By contrast, idiosyncratic risk should not affect the valuation of investment projects, as long as ﬁrm owners are diversiﬁed and managers maximize shareholder value. However, the data indicate that there is a signiﬁcant negative relation between idiosyncratic risk and investment for publicly traded ﬁrms in the United States. In addition, executives in publicly traded ﬁrms across the world hold a substantial stake in their ﬁrms, consistent with the predictions of agency theory. Combining these two observations sug- gests that, since investment decisions are undertaken by managers on behalf of shareholders, poorly diversiﬁed managers may cut back on investment when uncertainty about the ﬁrm’s future prospects increases,",

    "abstract": "We analyze the dynamic investment decision of a firm subject to an endogen- ous financing constraint. The threat of future funding shortfalls lowers the value of the firm's timing options and encourages acceleration of investment beyond the first-best optimal level. As well as highlighting another way by which capital market frictions can distort investment behavior, this result im- plies that (1) the sensitivity of investment to cash flow can be greatest for high- liquidity firms and (2) greater uncertainty has an ambiguous effect on invest- ment. Frictions in firm investment and financing decisions. One important insight of this work is that when there are informational asymmetries (e.g., Greenwald, Sti- glitz, and Weiss (1984), Myers and Majluf (1984)) or agency problems (e.g., Stulz (1990), Hart and Moore (1994)), profitable projects may not proceed if the firm has insufficient internal funds to pay for them. As a result, investment is less than its first-best level. In these models, projects are essentially \"now-or-never\" investments, so the investment decision is determined solely by the project's current net present value (NPV). In such a setting, the relationship between investment and liquidity is static: A shortage of internal funds reduces the number of states in which the firm can invest and thus has an adverse effect on today's investment opportunities. However, the investment-liquidity relationship can also have dy- namic features. For example, if projects can b",

    "abstract": "A standard assumption of structural models of default is that ﬁrms’ assets evolve exogenously. In this paper, we examine the importance of accounting for investment options in models of credit risk. In the presence of ﬁnancing and investment frictions, ﬁrm-level variables that proxy for asset composition are signiﬁcant determinants of credit spreads beyond leverage and asset volatility, because they capture the system- atic risk of ﬁrms’ assets. Cross-sectional studies of credit spreads that fail to control for the interdependence of leverage and investment decisions are unlikely to be very informative. Such frictions also give rise to a realistic term structure of credit spreads in a production economy. Ition from models in the tradition of Merton (1974) and Leland (1994). In these structural models of credit risk, ﬁrms optimally choose to default when the present value of coupon payments to bond holders is greater than the present value of future dividends.1 This optimality condition implies that leverage and asset volatility are key determinants of credit spreads.

    "abstract": "From the existing literature, it is not clear what effect financing constraints have on the sensitivities of firms’ investment to their cash flow. I propose an explanation that reconciles the conflicting empirical evidence. I present two models: the uncon- strained model, in which firms can raise external funds, and the constrained model, in which firms cannot do so. Using low dividends to identify financing constraints in my generated panel of data produces results consistent with those of Fazzari, Hubbard, and Petersen; using the constrained model produces results consistent with those of Kaplan and Zingales. THE Literature Documenting the sensitivity of firms’ investment to fluctuations in their internal funds, initiated by Fazzari, Hubbard, and Petersen (1988), is large and growing. The sensitivity is measured by the coefficient obtained from regressing investment on cash flow, controlling for investment opportunities using Tobin’sQ. Fazzari et al. View firms as constrained when external financ- ing is too expensive. In that case, firms must use internal funds to finance their investments rather than to pay out dividends. Fazzari et al. Identify firms with low dividends as “Most constrained” and firms with high dividends as “Least constrained.” As reported in Table I, “Most constrained” firms have in- vestments that aremore sensitive to cash flows than “Least constrained” firms.

    "abstract": "Does limited attention among investors affect stock returns? We compare the response to earnings announcements on Friday, when investor inattention is more likely, to the response on other weekdays. If inattention influences stock prices, we should observe less immediate response and more drift for Friday announcements. Indeed, Friday announcements have a 15% lower immediate response and a 70% higher delayed response. A portfolio investing in differential Friday drift earns substantial abnor- mal returns. In addition, trading volume is 8% lower around Friday announcements. These findings support explanations of post-earnings announcement drift based on underreaction to information caused by limited attention. Investors Have A Limited Amount OF Time AND Cognitive Resources to process infor- mation. Despite the intuitive appeal of limited attention, little evidence exists on the extent to which the quality of decision-making by investors declines in response to distractions. Incentives, information aggregation across investors, and arbitrageurs may eliminate the effects of limited attention. We examine a decision in which attention to new information plays a crucial role: the response to earnings surprises. We compare announcements that oc- cur just before the weekend, on Friday, to announcements on other weekdays. If weekends distract investors and lower the quality of decision-making, the immediate response to Friday earnings surprises should be less pronounced. As investors",

We then test this model using a sample of 539 large firms from 27 wealthy economies. Consistent with the model, we find evidence of higher valuation of firms in coun- tries with better protection of minority shareholders and in firms with higher cash- flow ownership by the controlling shareholder. A country is an important determinant of the development of its financial markets. Where laws are protective of outside investors and well enforced, investors are willing to finance firms, and financial markets are both broader and more valuable. In contrast, where laws are unprotective of investors, the development of financial markets is stunted. Moreover, systematic differ- ences among countries in the structure of laws and their enforcement, such as the historical origin of their laws, account for the differences in financial development (La Porta et al. (1997, 1998)). How does better protection of outside investors (both shareholders and creditors) promote financial market development? When their rights are bet- ter protected by the law, outside investors are willing to pay more for finan- cial assets such as equity and debt. They pay more because they recognize that, with better legal protection, more of the firm's profits would come back to them as interest or dividends as opposed to being expropriated by the entrepr",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to investigate the relation between investor pro- tection and firm liquidity. We posit that less protective environments lead to wider bid-ask spreads and thinner depths because they fail to minimize infor- mation asymmetries. The Hong Kong equity market provides a unique oppor- tunity to compare liquidity costs across distinct investor protection environments, but still within a common trading mechanism and currency. Our empirical findings verify that firm liquidity is significantly affected by in- vestor protection. Regression and matched-sample results show that Hong Kong-based equities exhibit narrower spreads and thicker depths than their China-based counterparts. THE Purpose of this study is to investigate the relation between economy-level in- vestor protection and firm-level liquidity. We posit an inverse relation between the quality of investor protection and the cost of liquidity. A good investor protec- tion environment minimizes information asymmetries and reduces the probabil- ity of trading against informed traders. In such an environment, liquidity providers incur relatively low costs and therefore offer narrow bid-ask spreads and thick depths. This is significant because lower liquidity costs have been shown to reduce the firm's cost of capital and increase its market value.l To date, the liquidity hypothesis has been difficult to test empirically because firms oper- ating in distinct investor protection environments also trade on",

    "abstract": "We examine whether irrational behavior among small (retail) investors drives post- IPO prices. We use prices from the grey market (the when-issued market that precedes European IPOs) to proxy for small investors’ valuations. High grey market prices (in- dicating overoptimism) are a very good predictor of first-day aftermarket prices, while low grey market prices (indicating excessive pessimism) are not. Moreover, we find long-run price reversal only following high grey market prices. This asymmetry occurs because larger (institutional) investors can choose between keeping the shares they are allocated in the IPO, and reselling them when small investors are overoptimistic. Behavioral Biases Have Become A Popular Explanation for a variety of asset- pricing phenomena which are hard to reconcile with a rational decision-making framework. For example, in the case of IPOs, Ritter and Welch (2002) conjec- ture that overenthusiasm among retail investors may explain high first-day returns and low long-run returns. However, the extent to which the presence of irrational investors (motivated by “investor sentiment”) can account for these phenomena is controversial, not least because of the difficulty in empirically identifying the demand curves of different investor groups.

    "abstract": "We study how investor sentiment affects the cross-section of stock returns. We pre- dict that a wave of investor sentiment has larger effects on securities whose valua- tions are highly subjective and difficult to arbitrage. Consistent with this prediction, we find that when beginning-of-period proxies for sentiment are low, subsequent re- turns are relatively high for small stocks, young stocks, high volatility stocks, un- profitable stocks, non-dividend-paying stocks, extreme growth stocks, and distressed stocks. When sentiment is high, on the other hand, these categories of stock earn relatively low subsequent returns. Theory argues that competition among rational investors, who diversify to opti- mize the statistical properties of their portfolios, will lead to an equilibrium in which prices equal the rationally discounted value of expected cash flows, and in which the cross-section of expected returns depends only on the cross-section of systematic risks. 1 Even if some investors are irrational, classical theory ar- gues, their demands are offset by arbitrageurs and thus have no significant impact on prices. In this paper, we present evidence that investor sentiment may have signifi- cant effects on the cross-section of stock prices. We start with simple theoretical predictions. Because a mispricing is the result of an uninformed demand shock in the presence of a binding arbitrage constraint, we predict that a broad- based wave of sentiment has cross-sectional effects (t",

Two mechanisms explain these results: crowding out of alternative ﬁnancing and low sensitivity of professional investors to tax credits. With a large-scale survey and a stylized model, we show that low responsiveness among professional angels may re- ﬂect the fat-tailed return distributions that characterize high-growth startups.

    "abstract": "We propose that ex-dividend day excess volume is motivated by tax heterogeneity among investors, and thus is increasing in investor tax heterogeneity. Institutional ownership is our measure of heterogeneity. Since investor heterogeneity is a concave function of institutional ownership, we hypothesize that ex-day volume is a concave function of institutional ownership. Cross-sectional tests support the tax-motivated trading hypothesis. Additional tests, using trade size and pension ownership as prox- ies for institutional trades, yield similar results. We contribute to the literature by considering the interaction between payout policy and ownership structure in ex- plaining the cross-sectional variation in ex-day volume. Michaely AND Vila (1995, 1996) Demonstrate That Investors with differing rel- ative preferences for dividends versus capital gains will trade with each other around ex-dividend days. They argue that although dividend yield, which is used as a measure of the tax-disadvantaged portion of security returns for some investors, is a necessary condition for ex-day excess trading, it is not a sufficient condition. It must be accompanied by tax-induced investor hetero- geneity, defined as the difference in relative tax rates on dividends and capital gains for different categories of investors. Even if the level of tax-disadvantaged dividend yield is very high, if most investors are in the same tax category, ex- day excess trading volume will be thin. Using an economy-",

    "title": "Inﬂation Risk in Corporate Bonds",
    "abstract": "We argue that corporate bond yields reﬂect fears of debt deﬂation. When debt is nom- inal, unexpectedly low inﬂation increases real liabilities and default risk. In a real business cycle model with optimal but infrequent capital structure choice, more uncer- tain or procyclical inﬂation leads to quantitatively important increases in corporate log yields in excess of default-free log yields. A panel of credit spread indexes from six developed countries shows that credit spreads rise by 14 basis points if inﬂation volatility or the inﬂation-stock correlation increases by one standard deviation. Corporate AND Sovereign Bonds in developed countries are overwhelmingly nominal. Firms are therefore exposed to the possibility of “debt deﬂation,” when a surprise drop in inﬂation leads to increases in real liabilities and cor- porate default risk (Fisher (1933)). The literature has argued that corporate bonds price the volatility of real ﬁrm values as proxied by equity volatility (Campbell and Taksler (2003), Collin-Dufresne, Goldstein, and Martin (2001)). We ﬁnd that inﬂation risk can explain at least as much variation in credit spreads as can equity volatility and the dividend-price ratio. In a panel of credit spread indexes from six developed countries, a one-standard-deviation move in either inﬂation volatility or the inﬂation-stock correlation increases credit spreads by 14 basis points (bps), relative to average credit spreads around 100 bps.

    "title": "Inﬂuencing Control: Jawboning in Risk Arbitrage",
    "abstract": "In an “activist risk arbitrage,” a shareholder attempts to improve terms of an an- nounced M&A through public campaigns. Activists target deals with low premiums and those susceptible to managerial conﬂicts of interest, including going-private deals and deals in which CEOs receive outsized payments. Activist arbitrageurs are asso- ciated with a signiﬁcant decrease in the probability that targets will be sold to the announced bidders, and an increase in the premium paid, both ex post among sur- viving deals and ex ante among all deals. Activist arbitrage serves as a governance mechanism in M&A and earns higher returns than passive arbitrage. INA N “activist Risk Arbitrage ,”A Shareholder who often acquires a signiﬁcant stake in a target company after an announced takeover attempts to block the announced deal under its current terms. The dissident shareholder threatens to vote against the deal and conducts public campaigns designed to persuade other shareholders to do the same unless the target company’s management team is able to improve the deal premium. In the presence of such activists, deals are more likely to fail, but the average premium paid is higher even taking incremental deal failure into account. This strategy, as its name suggests, combines shareholder activism with a more traditional, “passive” risk arbitrage approach. In particular, it serves both as a governance remedy for shareholders who deem announced merger and acquisition (M&A) suggestions from two anonymo",

    "abstract": "Financial press reports claim that Internet stock message boards can move markets. We study the effect of more than 1.5 million messages posted on Yahoo! Finance and Raging Bull about the 45 companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Dow Jones Internet Index. Bullishness is measured using computational linguistics methods. Wall Street Journal news stories are used as controls. We find that stock messages help predict market volatility. Their effect on stock returns is statistically significant but economically small. Consistent with Harris and Raviv (1993), disagree- ment among the posted messages is associated with increased trading volume. Many People ARE Devoting a considerable amount of time and effort creating and reading the messages posted on Internet stock message boards. News stories report that the message boards are having a significant impact on financial markets. The Securities and Exchange Commission has prosecuted people for Internet messages. All this attention to Internet stock messages caused us to wonder whether these messages actually contain financially relevant informa- tion. 1 We consider three specific issues. Does the number of messages posted or the bullishness of these messages help to predict returns? Is disagreement among the messages associated with more trades?

    "abstract": "This paper investigates whether Tether, a digital currency pegged to the U.S. Dollar, inﬂuenced Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency prices during the 2017 boom. Using al- gorithms to analyze blockchain data, we ﬁnd that purchases with Tether are timed following market downturns and result in sizable increases in Bitcoin prices. The ﬂow is attributable to one entity, clusters below round prices, induces asymmetric auto- correlations in Bitcoin, and suggests insufﬁcient Tether reserves before month-ends. Rather than demand from cash investors, these patterns are most consistent with the supply-based hypothesis of unbacked digital money inﬂating cryptocurrency prices. Innovation, Excessive Speculation, AND Dubious behavior are often closely linked.

    "abstract": "Commercial loan valuations crucially depend on accurate loan income, but under- written income on commercial mortgage-backed securities (cmbs) loans is commonly overstated relative to actual property income. Consistent with these differences be- ing originator-speciﬁc, income overstatement in Cmbs 2.0 deals varies widely and persistently across originators, is priced by originators, is related across property types within an originator, is predictable ex ante, and is accompanied by inﬂation of past ﬁnancials. Risk retention and associated regulation had no discernible effect on income overstatement. Originator income overstatement is highly predictive of pre- and COVID-period loan distress. Overall, recent market stresses reveal large systemic differences in underwriting standards across originators. THE 2007 TO 2009 Financial crisis revealed substantial problems in resi- dential mortgage-backed securities (rmbs) and related structured securities. Commercial mortgage-backed securities (cmbs) suffered a better fate, but like most areas of securitization, faced a prolonged retraction from 2008 to 2011. Following increased market scrutiny and Dodd-Frank, several reforms and improvements to quality and market structure were introduced such that postcrisis Cmbs is often described by practitioners as Cmbs 2.0.

    "abstract": "When developing countries announce debt relief agreements under the Brady Plan, their stock markets appreciate by an average of 60% in real dollar terms—a $42 billion increase in shareholder value. There is no significant stock market increase for a control group of countries that do not sign Brady agreements. The stock market ap- preciations successfully forecast higher future resource transfers, investment, and growth. Since the market capitalization of U.S. Commercial banks with developing country loan exposure also rises—by $13 billion—the results suggest that both bor- rower and lenders can benefit from debt relief when the borrower suffers from debt overhang. Bono AND Jesse Helms Want Debt Relief for the developing countries. The Pope and 17 million people are behind them. At a June 1999 meeting of G8 leaders in Cologne, Germany, the lead singer of the rock band U2 presented Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder with 17 million signatures in support of the Debt Relief Initiative (Jubilee (2000)). In November 1998, Pope John Paul II issued a Papal Bull calling on the wealthy nations to relieve the debts of developing nations in order to “remove the shadow of death” (The Vatican (1998)). Opponents of debt relief occupy less hallowed ground but are no less zealous about their cause, citing at least two reasons why the debt relief campaign is misguided. First, debt relief alone cannot solve the problem of developing coun- try debt. Even if all debt were forgiven, it will accumulate",

    "title": "Is Disinflation Good for the Stock Market?",
    "abstract": "The stock market appreciates by an average of 24 percent in real dollar terms when countries attempt to stabilize annual inflation rates that are greater than 40 percent. In contrast, the average market response is 0 when the pre-stabilization rate of inflation is less than 40 percent. These results suggest that the potential long-run benefits of stabilization may dominate short-run costs at high levels of inflation, but at low to moderate levels of inflation, benefits may be offset by costs in a present value sense. Stock market responses also help predict the change in inflation and output in the year following all 81 stabilization efforts. In the past 25 years, countries all over the world have engaged in repeated attempts to reduce inflation (Fischer, Sahay, and Vegh (2002)). Presumably, they do not attempt to stabilize inflation unless it is in their interest to do so. Hence, the sheer number of attempted disinflations over the past quar- ter century seems to suggest a widely held view that the expected long-run benefits of reducing inflation outweigh any short-run costs. Yet, if there is a consensus that the net present value of disinflation is positive, it is not clearly articulated in the literature. Macroeconomists as- sess the social cost of disinflation by constructing the sacrifice ratio (Okun (1978), Gordon (1982), Fischer (1986), Ball (1994)). The sacrifice ratio mea- sures the short-run cost of reducing inflation as the sum of undiscounted ford, CA 94305-5015.",

We identify coworkers’ effect on miscon- duct using changes in coworkers caused by mergers of ﬁnancial advisory ﬁrms. The tests include merger-ﬁrm ﬁxed effects to exploit the variation in changes to coworkers across branches of the same ﬁrm.

    "abstract": "Accounting rules, through their interactions with capital regulations, affect ﬁnancial these interactions: life insurers have greater ﬂexibility than property and casualty insurers to hold speculative-grade assets at historical cost, and the degree to which life insurers recognize market values differs across U.S. States. During the ﬁnancial crisis, insurers facing a lesser degree of market value recognition are less likely to sell downgraded asset-backed securities. To improve their capital positions, these insurers disproportionately resort to gains trading, selectively selling otherwise unrelated bonds with high unrealized gains, transmitting shocks across markets.

    "abstract": "We investigate the role of information-based trading in affecting asset returns. We show in a rational expectation example how private information affects equilib- rium asset returns. Using a market microstructure model, we derive a measure of the probability of information-based trading, and we estimate this measure using data for individual NYSE-listed stocks for 1983 to 1998. We then incorporate our estimates into a Fama and French (1992) asset-pricing framework. Our main re- sult is that information does affect asset prices. A difference of 10 percentage points in the probability of information-based trading between two stocks leads to a dif- ference in their expected returns of 2.5 percent per year. Asset Pricing IS Fundamental to our understanding of the wealth dynamics of an economy. This central importance has resulted in an extensive literature on asset pricing, much of it focusing on the economic factors that influence asset prices. Despite the fact that virtually all assets trade in markets, one set of factors not typically considered in asset-pricing models are the fea- tures of the markets in which the assets trade. Instead, the literature on asset pricing abstracts from the mechanics of asset price evolution, leaving unsettled the underlying question of how equilibrium prices are actually attained. Market microstructure, conversely, focuses on how the mechanics of the trad- ing process affect the evolution of trading prices. A major focus of this exten- sive lit",

    "abstract": "Diversified conglomerates are valued less than matched portfolios of pure-play firms. Recent studies find that this diversification discount results from conglom- erates' inefficient allocation of capital expenditures across divisions. Much of this work uses Tobin's q as a proxy for investment opportunities, therefore hypothesiz- ing that q is a good proxy. This paper treats measurement error in q. Using a measurement-error consistent estimator on the sorts regressions in the literature, I find no evidence of inefficient allocation of investment. The results in the liter- ature appear to be artifacts of measurement error and of the correlation between investment opportunities and liquidity. Diversified Conglomerates Appear TO Trade at a discount relative to matched portfolios of pure-play firms. Studies documenting this stylized fact include Lang and Stulz (1994), Berger and Ofek (1995), Comment and Jarrell (1995), and Servaes (1996). Recent empirical work has sought to find the source of this diversification discount. Building on the theoretical work in Milgrom and Roberts (1990), Stein (1997), and Scharfstein and Stein (2000) on the inefficiency of internal capital markets, this literature has asked specifi- cally whether diversified firms allocate their capital expenditures ineffi- ciently across divisions.

Our data set contains the stock holdings of every German bank and those of their corresponding retail clients.

We present afﬁrmative evidence for all three questions and conclude that proprietary trading can, in fact, be detrimental to retail investors.

    "abstract": "Short-selling, and this risk explains the performance of short strategies. One possible mechanism is that borrowing fee risk carries a risk premium. Since the present value of the uncertain borrowing fee is reﬂected in options prices, the difference between option-implied and realized fees estimates this premium. We ﬁnd that the risk pre- mium is small. Moreover, if the risk premium is substantial, it should be reﬂected in the returns to short-selling stock after adjusting for stock borrowing fees. However, borrowing fee risk does not predict fee-adjusted returns.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates whether individual venture capitalists have repeatable in- vestment skill and the extent to which their skill is impacted by the venture capital (VC) ﬁrm where they work. We examine a unique data set that tracks the performance of individual venture capitalists’ investments over time and as they move between ﬁrms. We ﬁnd evidence of skill and exit style differences even among venture partners investing at the same VC ﬁrm at the same time. Furthermore, our estimates suggest the partners’ human capital is two to ﬁve times more important than the VC ﬁrm’s organizational capital in explaining performance. Venture Capital (VC) Investments are an important engine of innovation and economic growth, but extremely risky from an individual investor’s point of view. For instance, Sahlman (2010) reports that 85% of returns come from just 10% of investments, and over the period 1987 to 2012 only 12.8% of investments achieved an initial public offering.1 Furthermore, there are large differences in fund performance between top-quartile and bottom-quartile VC funds. In spite of the rarity of top-performing investments, however, Kaplan and Schoar (2005) report persistence in fund performance. They show that, in contrast to other asset classes such as mutual funds, VC ﬁrms that have a fund that outperforms the industry are likely to outperform with their next fund.

    "abstract": "We offer evidence that interest rate spreads on syndicated loans to corporate borrow- ers are economically significantly smaller in Europe than in the United States, other things equal. Differences in borrower, loan, and lender characteristics do not appear to explain this phenomenon. Borrowers overwhelmingly issue in their natural home market and bank portfolios display home bias. This may explain why pricing discrep- ancies are not competed away, though their causes remain a puzzle. Thus, important determinants of loan origination market outcomes remain to be identified, home bias appears to be material for pricing, and corporate financing costs differ across Europe and the United States. WE Offer Evidence That Prices OF Syndicated corporate loans differ between the European and U.S. Markets, with interest rate spreads smaller in Europe by about 30 basis points (bps) on average over the past decade, after controlling for risk and other factors. The differences are economically and statistically significant. Levels of differences are larger for riskier borrowers, but spreads in the European market are roughly 20% less than for comparable loans in the United States across the risk spectrum. We cannot reject the hypothesis that price differences are as large today as they were a decade ago. We control for a host of factors known (or thought) to affect corporate debt decisions and pricing. Although many controls are correlated with levels of spreads, they have little effect on",

    "abstract": "The merit of international convergence of bank capital requirements in the presence of divergent closure policies of different central banks is examined. The lack of a complementary variation between minimum bank capital re- quirements and regulatory forbearance leads to a spillover from more forbear- ing to less forbearing economies and reduces the competitive advantage of banks in less forbearing economies. Linking the central bank's forbearance to its alignment with domestic bank owners, it is shown that in equilibrium, a regression toward the worst closure policy may result: The central banks of initially less forbearing economies also adopt greater forbearance. I analyze the joint design of two bank regulatory mechanisms: minimum capital requirements, which are an ex ante mechanism to prevent bank failures, and clo- sure policy, which is an ex post mechanism to manage the cost of bank failures. At the heart of the paper is a simple but fundamental point: Ex post policies af- fect ex ante incentives, and, hence, the design of an ex ante mechanism must take into account any feedback from the ex post policies. The optimal design of capital requirements is thus tied to the extent of forbearance exercised by the central bank's closure policy. This warrants a closer scrutiny of the merits of creating a \"level playing field\" in capital requirements across countries, as proposed and ymous referee and Rick Green (editor) have been very valuable.

    "abstract": "Ait-Sahalia (1996) and Stanton (1997) use nonparametric estimators applied to short-term interest rate data to conclude that the drift function contains impor- tant nonlinearities. We study the finite-sample properties of their estimators by applying them to simulated sample paths of a square-root diffusion. Although the drift function is linear, both estimators suggest nonlinearities of the type and mag- nitude reported in Ait-Sahalia (1996) and Stanton (1997). Combined with the re- sults of a weighted least squares estimator, this evidence implies that nonlinearity of the short rate drift is not a robust stylized fact. A Common Approach IN Modeling THE Term Structure of interest rates and pricing interest rate derivatives is to express interest rates in terms of one or more state variables that follow continuous-time Markov processes. In time homogeneous one-factor models there is only one state variable, which is usually taken to be the short or instantaneous rate of interest. This is the case, for example, in Vasicek (1977), Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1985) (here- after, CIR), the translated CIR model discussed in Pearson and Sun (1994), Brennan and Schwartz (1979), Courtadon (1982), the time homogenous continuous-time versions of the Black, Derman, and Toy (1990) and Black and Karasinski (1991) models, and in the empirical models considered by Chan et al. (1992). In these and similar models, the properties of the interest rate process are determined entirely by the drift",

    "title": "Is the United States a Lucky Survivor? A",
    "abstract": "Using international data, we quantify the magnitude of survivorship bias in U.S. Eq- uity market performance, ﬁnding that it explains about one-third of the equity risk premium in the past century. We model the subjective crash belief of an investor who infers the crash risk in the United States by cross-learning from other countries. The U.S. Crash probability shows a persistent and widening divergence from the im- plied global average. We attribute the upward bias in the measured equity premium to crashes that did not occur in-sample and to shocks to valuations resulting from learning about the probability. THE 6% Average Annual Outperformance of stocks over short-duration bonds has attracted ample attention in the economics and ﬁnance litera- ture. Because this outperformance is difﬁcult to explain using prevailing consumption-based asset pricing models, it has become known as the eq- uity premium puzzle (Hansen and Singleton (1982) and Mehra and Prescott (1985)). The literature has proposed many potential solutions since the identi- ﬁcation of the puzzle, including richer consumption growth dynamics, sophisti- cated utility and belief speciﬁcations of the representative investor, and taxes.1 Another strand of the literature questions the puzzle’s economic and statistical robustness.2 In this paper, we contribute to this latter strand, building on the striking ﬁnding in Goetzmann and Jorion (1999) that U.S. Equity performance appears to be an exception rather than the norm",

    "abstract": "We examine the effects of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)-mandated temporary suspension of short-sale price tests for a set of Pilot securities. While short- selling activity increases both for Nyse- and Nasdaq-listed Pilot stocks, returns and volatility at the daily level are unaffected. NYSE-listed Pilot stocks experience more symmetric trading patterns and a slight increase in spreads and intraday volatility after the suspension while there is a smaller effect on market quality for Nasdaq- listed Pilot stocks. The results suggest that the effect of the price tests on market quality can largely be attributed to distortions in order flow created by the price tests themselves. Regulation SHO (REG SHO) Provides a new regulatory framework governing short-selling of securities in U.S. Equity markets. The rules were passed on September 7, 2004 and became effective on January 3, 2005. 1 Reg SHO is in- tended to establish uniform locate and delivery requirements, create uniform marking requirements for sales of all equity securities, and establish a proce- dure to temporarily suspend the “provisions of Rule 10a-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and any short-sale price test of any exchange or na- tional securities association for short sales of certain securities for certain time periods” in order to “evaluate the overall effectiveness and necessity of such restrictions.” In this paper, we study the effect on market quality of the Securities and Exchange Comm",

    "title": "Judging Fund Managers by the Company",
    "abstract": "We develop a performance evaluation approach in which a fund manager’s skill is judged by the extent to which the manager’s investment decisions resemble the deci- sions of managers with distinguished performance records. The proposed performance measures use historical returns and holdings of many funds to evaluate the perfor- mance of a single fund. Simulations demonstrate that our measures are particularly useful in ranking managers. In an application that relies on such ranking, our mea- sures reveal strong predictability in the returns of U.S. Equity funds. Our measures provide information about future fund returns that is not contained in the standard measures. People ARE Often Judged BY THE Company they keep. Various human charac- teristics that are difficult to observe directly are commonly inferred from the characteristics of others who behave in a similar manner. For example, a bored air traveler eager to chat about Madonna’s life story is more likely to turn to a fellow passenger reading The National Enquirer than to a passenger read- ing TheW all Street Journal, because the readership of the former periodical is generally known to be more interested in celebrity gossip. In the same spirit, when people compete, their success is often predicted by their techniques, and the quality of a given technique is frequently evaluated based on the track records of the technique’s followers. For example, suppose a group of basketball players, some of whom shoot with both hands",

    "title": "LAPM: A Liquidity-Based Asset Pricing Model",
    "abstract": "The intertemporal Capm predicts that an asset's price is equal to the expectation of the product of the asset's payoff and a representative consumer's intertemporal marginal rate of substitution. This paper develops an alternative approach to asset pricing based on corporations' desire to hoard liquidity. Our corporate finance ap- proach suggests new determinants of asset prices such as the distribution of wealth within the corporate sector and between the corporate sector and the consumers. Also, leverage ratios, capital adequacy requirements, and the composition of sav- ings affect the corporate demand for liquid assets and, thereby, interest rates. Starting With THE Capital Asset Pricing Model (capm, derived by Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1965), and Mossin (1966)), market finance has emphasized the role of consumers' time preference and risk aversion in determining as- set prices. The intertemporal consumption-based asset pricing model (e.g., Rubinstein (1976), Lucas (1978), Breeden (1979), Harrison and Kreps (1979), Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1985), Hansen and Jagannathan (1991)) predicts that an asset's current price is equal to the expectation, conditioned on cur- rent information, of the product of the asset's payoff and a representative consumer's intertemporal marginal rate of substitution (imrs). While fun- damental, this dominant paradigm for pricing assets has some well- recognized shortcomings (see below), and there is clearly scope for alternative and complementary a",

    "abstract": "We study the impact of social networks on agents’ ability to gather superior infor- mation about ﬁrms. Exploiting novel data on the educational background of sell-side analysts and senior corporate ofﬁcers, we ﬁnd that analysts outperform by up to 6.60% per year on their stock recommendations when they have an educational link to the company. Pre-Reg FD, this school-tie return premium is 9.36% per year, while post- Reg FD it is nearly zero.

    "title": "Labor Mobility: Implications for Asset Pricing",
    "abstract": "Labor mobility is the ﬂexibility of workers to walk away from an industry in response to better opportunities. I develop a model in which labor ﬂows make bad times worse for shareholders who are left with capital that is less productive. The model shows that ﬁrms face greater operating leverage by providing ﬂexibility to mobile workers. I construct an empirical measure of labor mobility consistent with the model and docu- ment an economically signiﬁcant cross-sectional relation between mobility, operating leverage, and stock returns. I ﬁnd that ﬁrms in mobile industries earn returns over 5% higher than those in less mobile industries. Firms DO NOT OWN their most important production factor—labor—but merely rent it from willing individuals who have the ﬂexibility to leave. This paper studies how the lack of full control over labor represents a source of risk for ﬁrm owners. In particular, the paper addresses the following question: are ﬁrms in industries employing workers whose labor skills are portable to other industries more exposed to systematic risk than those in industries where workers have less portable skills? The answer to this question is important for a number of reasons. First, it offers insights on the source of a ﬁrm’s systematic risk by linking workers’ decisions to asset price dynamics. Second, it sheds light on why observable properties of the workforce employed in an industry should explain cross-sectional differences in expected asset returns. Finally, it m",

    "abstract": "Our results highlight the importance of interaction among management, labor, and investors in shaping corporate governance. We find that strong union laws protect not only workers but also underperforming managers. Weak investor protection com- bined with strong union laws are conducive to worker–management alliances, wherein poorly performing firms sell assets to prevent large-scale layoffs, garnering worker support to retain management. Asset sales in weak investor protection countries lead to further deteriorating performance, whereas in strong investor protection countries they improve performance and lead to more layoffs. Strong union laws are less effec- tive in preventing layoffs when financial leverage is high. Tion of investors in shaping corporate governance.1 However, investors are but one of many stakeholders. Other stakeholders who participate in governance include labor and management. Labor receives legal protection with substan- tial variation across countries, and its self-interests often conflict with those of investors, at least in the short run. How do firms respond to these conflicting interests? The answer depends on stakeholders’ relative influence on the deci- sion making process, which varies across countries due to political and social factors (Roe (2003)). When investors have greater influence, higher priority is given to enhancing capital value. When labor has greater influence, employee welfare may receive higher priority over value enhancement (T",

I develop a model in which ﬁrms optimally under- take such replacement when their productivity is low. Hence, ﬁrms with routine-task labor maintain a replacement option that hedges their value against unfavorable macroeconomic shocks and lowers their expected returns. Using establishment-level occupational data, I construct a measure of ﬁrms’ share of routine-task labor. Com- pared to their industry peers, ﬁrms with a higher share of routine-task labor (i) invest more in machines and reduce more routine-task labor during economic downturns, and (ii) have lower expected stock returns.

    "title": "Land and Credit: A Study of the Political",
    "abstract": "We ﬁnd that, in the early 20th century, counties in the United States where the agricultural elite had disproportionately large land holdings had signiﬁcantly fewer banks per capita, even correcting for state-level effects. Moreover, credit appears to have been costlier, and access to it more limited, in these counties. The evidence suggests that elites may restrict ﬁnancial development in order to limit access to ﬁnance, and they may be able to do so even in countries with well-developed political institutions. A Recent Literature Emphasizes the political economy underpinnings of eco- nomic underdevelopment. It notes that powerful constituencies, which arise, for example, from the pattern of land holdings in a country, can drive the development of economic institutions, and growth more generally (see, e.g., Engermann and Sokoloff (2002)). Banks are clearly important economic insti- tutions. While historians have argued that political forces have shaped banking systems (see, e.g., Haber (2005a)), there has been little systematic examina- tion of the evidence. In this paper, we examine more systematically whether the constituencies or interest groups that emerge in a country as a result of the distribution of land holdings—often the earliest and most important form of wealth—can shape the development of the banking system. The precise channel through which constituencies or interest groups oper- ate is also a matter of some debate. Some (see, e.g., Acemoglu, Johnson, and Inter",

    "title": "Late to Recessions: Stocks and the Business Cycle",
    "abstract": "I ﬁnd that returns are predictably negative for several months after the onset of recessions, becoming high only thereafter. I identify business cycle turning points by estimating a state-space model using macroeconomic data. Conditioning on the business cycle further reveals that returns exhibit momentum in recessions, whereas in expansions they display the mild reversals expected from discount rate changes. A strategy exploiting this pattern produces positive alphas. Using analyst forecast data, I show that my ﬁndings are consistent with investors’ slow reaction to recessions. When expected returns are negative, analysts are too optimistic and their downward expectation revisions are exceptionally high. A Large AND Expanding Literature explores the relation between stock returns and the business cycle. The traditional view is that stocks are ratio- nally priced to immediately reﬂect investors’ expectations about future eco- nomic activity and that expected excess returns on stocks are positive, vary over time, and display countercyclical behavior. 1 I argue that stock prices are less efﬁcient at incorporating business cycle ﬂuctuations than what the litera- ture has previously acknowledged. Speciﬁcally, I show that stock prices reﬂect Drechsler, Frank Schorfheide, Robert Stambaugh, and Amir Yaron for their invaluable guidance in writing this paper.

    "title": "Law, Stock Markets, and Innovation",
    "abstract": "We study a broad sample of ﬁrms across 32 countries and ﬁnd that strong shareholder protections and better access to stock market ﬁnancing lead to substantially higher long-run rates of R&D investment, particularly in small ﬁrms, but are unimportant for ﬁxed capital investment. Credit market development has a modest impact on ﬁxed investment but no impact on R&D. These ﬁndings connect law and stock markets with innovative activities key to economic growth, and show that legal rules and ﬁnancial developments affecting the availability of external equity ﬁnancing are particularly important for risky, intangible investments not easily ﬁnanced with debt. AN Extensive Literature Shows that countries with legal systems providing strong protections for outside investors have larger, more accessible, and more developed stock markets (e.g., La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer (LLS; 2006, 2008)). Furthermore, a number of studies ﬁnd evidence of a positive con- nection between stock market development and broad measures of economic growth (e.g., Levine and Zervos (1998) and Bekaert, Harvey, and Lundblad (2005)). The literature provides much less evidence, however, directly linking law and ﬁnance with ﬁrm-level activities that promote economic growth. The evidence that does exist indicates that the causal connections work principally through productivity growth rather than physical capital accumulation (see the Levine (2005) survey).

    "title": "Lazy Investors, Discretionary Consumption,",
    "abstract": "When consumption betas of stocks are computed using year-over-year consumption growth based upon the fourth quarter, the consumption-based asset pricing model (ccapm) explains the cross-section of stock returns as well as the Fama and French (1993) three-factor model. The CCAPM’s performance deteriorates substantially when consumption growth is measured based upon other quarters. For the Ccapm to hold at any given point in time, investors must make their consumption and in- vestment decisions simultaneously at that point in time. We suspect that this is more likely to happen during the fourth quarter, given investors’ tax year ends in December. There IS General Agreement IN THE Literature that the risk premium that in- vestors require to invest in stocks varies across stocks of different types of firms in a systematic way. In particular, investors appear to be content to re- ceive a lower return on average to invest in growth firms compared to value firms, and require a higher return to invest in smaller firms compared to larger firms. The question is, why? According to the standard consumption-based as- set pricing model (ccapm) developed by Rubinstein (1976), Lucas (1978), and Breeden (1979), investors will be content to accept a lower return on those as- sets that provide better insurance against consumption risk by paying more when macroeconomic events unfavorably affect consumption choices.

    "abstract": "We present evidence that fund managers inflate quarter-end portfolio prices with last-minute purchases of stocks already held. The magnitude of price inflation ranges from 0.5 percent per year for large-cap funds to well over 2 percent for small-cap funds. We find that the cross section of inflation matches the cross sec- tion of incentives from the flow/performance relation, that a surge of trading in the quarter's last minutes coincides with a surge in equity prices, and that the inflation is greatest for the stocks held by funds with the most incentive to inflate, controlling for the stocks' size and performance. Quarter-end AND Especially Year-end equity mutual fund prices are abnor- mally high. We present strong evidence that some mutual fund managers mark up their holdings at quarter end through aggressive trading of stocks they already hold. Funds with the greatest ability and most incentive to improve their performance exhibit the largest turn-of-quarter effect. Intra- daily data show a surge of transactions and transaction prices in the quar- ter's last few minutes, and fund-holdings data show a larger effect in the funds with the most incentive to mark up.

    "abstract": "We study risk premiums in the U.S. Treasury bond market from the perspective of a Bayesian econometrician BLwho learns in real time from disagreement among in- vestors about future bond yields. Notably, disagreement has substantial predictive power for yields, and BL’s risk premiums are less volatile than those in the analogous model without learning. BL’s forecasts are substantially more accurate than the con- sensus forecasts of market professionals, particularly following U.S. Recessions. The predictive power of disagreement is distinct from the (much weaker) one of inﬂation and output growth. Rather, it appears to reﬂect uncertainty about future ﬁscal policy. Most OF THE Literature That Studies risk compensation in bond markets follows Dai and Singleton ( 2000) and Duffee ( 2002) in assuming that investors have full knowledge of the dynamics of risk factors in bond markets. How- ever, market participants trading U.S. Treasury bonds need to form prospec- tive views in real-time on expected returns, while assessing the implications of changing policy, regulatory, and political environments for yields.

    "title": "Learning about Internal Capital Markets",
    "abstract": "We examine the investment behavior of firms before and after being spun off from their parent companies. Their investment after the spin-off is significantly more sensitive to measures of investment opportunities (e.g., industry Tobin's Q or in- dustry investment) than it is before the spin-off. Spin-offs tend to cut investment in low Q industries and increase investment in high Q industries. These changes are observed primarily in spin-offs of firms in industries unrelated to the parents' industries and in spin-offs where the stock market reacts favorably to the spin-off announcement. Our findings suggest that spin-offs may improve the allocation of capital. THE Prevailing Model OF THE Firm in corporate finance envisions money flow- ing in from the capital and product markets and flowing out as investment examining what actually happens when the money is inside the firm (Lam- ont (1997), Shin and Stulz (1998), Scharfstein (1998), Rajan et al. (2000)). How, for example, does corporate headquarters allocate funds across busi- ness and geographic units? If information and agency problems exist be- tween headquarters and the external capital market-a theme that runs through a good deal of the corporate finance literature-does it also exist between headquarters and business units in the internal capital market? If so, do such problems distort investment allocations within the firm? Understanding how internal capital markets work is important for two reasons. First, the relative e",

    "title": "Learning about Mutual Fund Managers",
    "abstract": "We study capital allocations to managers with two mutual funds, and show that investors learn about managers from their performance records. Flows into a fund are predicted by the manager’s performance in his other fund, especially when he outperforms and when signals from the other fund are more useful. In equilibrium, capital should be allocated such that there is no cross-fund predictability. However, we ﬁnd positive predictability, particularly among underperforming funds. Our results are consistent with incomplete learning: while investors move capital in the right direction, they do not withdraw enough capital when the manager underperforms in his other fund. Mutual Funds ARE Important investment vehicles for many households. While previous studies show that investors infer funds’ ability to generate excess future returns from past returns and allocate their capital accordingly (Sirri and Tufano ( 1998), Huang, Wei, and Yan ( 2007, 2012), Franzoni and Schmalz (2016)), some attribute the performance-chasing behavior to behavioral biases (Frazzini and Lamont ( 2008), Bailey, Kumar, and Ng ( 2010)).1 In this paper, we an Associate Editor, and two anonymous referees for many helpful suggestions.

    "abstract": "This paper examines the effects of uncertainty about the stock return predictabil- ity on optimal dynamic portfolio choice in a continuous time setting for a long- horizon investor. Uncertainty about the predictive relation affects the optimal portfolio choice through dynamic learning, and leads to a state-dependent relation between the optimal portfolio choice and the investment horizon. There is substan- tial market timing in the optimal hedge demands, which is caused by stochastic covariance between stock return and dynamic learning. The opportunity cost of ignoring predictability or learning is found to be quite substantial. HOW Much Should A “long-horizon” investor allocate to equity? The conven- tional wisdom says that a long-horizon investor should invest more in equity because, over long horizons, above-average returns tend to offset below- average returns. This is the notion of “time diversification.” Samuelson~1989, 1990!, among others, has argued that the notion of time diversification is spurious: when stock returns are i.i.d., for example, the optimal portfolio is independent of the horizon for an investor with an isoelastic utility function. When stock returns are predictable, however, the optimal stock allocation does depend on the investment horizon, even if the investor has an isoelastic utility. In this setting, the investment opportunity set is stochastic and the intertemporal hedge demand introduced by Merton ~1971! Becomes central to the dynamics of asset",

    "abstract": "We offer a new explanation for why academic studies typically fail to find value cre- ation in bank mergers. Our conjectures are predicated on the idea that, until recently, large bank acquisitions were a new phenomenon, with no best practices history to inform bank managers or market investors. We hypothesize that merging banks, and investors pricing bank mergers, learn by observing information that spills over from previous bank mergers. We find evidence consistent with these conjectures for 216 M&As of large, publicly traded U.S. Commercial banks between 1987 and 1999. Our findings are consistent with semistrong stock market efficiency. You can observe a lot just by watching. —Lawrence Peter (Yogi) Berra Under THE Semistrong Efficient Markets Hypothesis, stock prices react positively (negatively) to public events and announcements that informed market partic- ipants expect will increase (decrease) long-run firm value. However, realized long-run outcomes need not be consistent with short-run market reactions. One reason is that, after the event, the public information set about the firm— including information idiosyncratic to the firm, its competitors, its customers, its production technology, or its regulation—may change unexpectedly in a way that exacerbates, mutes, or reverses the impact of the short-run event on long- run firm value. Another reason is that the event that is being priced in the short-run may itself be poorly understood by market participants. Indeed, if",

    "title": "Learning by Owning in a Lemons Market",
    "abstract": "We study market dynamics when an owner learns about the quality of her asset over time. Since this information is private, the owner sells strategically to a less informed buyer following sufﬁcient negative information. In response, market prices feature a “U-shape” and trading probabilities a “hump-shape” with respect to the time to sale. As the owner initially acquires greater information, buyers suffer greater adverse selection, and prices fall accordingly . Eventually , the probability of an informed sale shrinks, and prices rebound. We provide evidence consistent with our model in mar- kets for residential real estate, venture capital investments, and construction equip- ment. IN Many Settings , Asset Owners collect private information about the quality of their assets. For example, a homeowner may learn about the desir- ability of her neighborhood by exploring the local community and interacting with her neighbors. Likewise, a venture capital (VC) investor may learn about the viability of a portfolio company by maintaining a close eye on company developments and company personnel. Finally , a ﬁrm may uncover new infor- mation about the quality or productivity of a capital asset such as a machine or Boulder.

    "abstract": "Using unique data on employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs), we examine the inﬂu- ence of networks on investment decisions. Comparing employees within a ﬁrm during the same election window with metro area ﬁxed effects, we ﬁnd that the choices of coworkers in the ﬁrm’s Espp exert a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on employees’ own decisions to participate and trade. Moreover, we ﬁnd that the presence of high-information em- ployees magniﬁes the effects of peer networks. Given participation in an Espp is value-maximizing, our analysis suggests the potential of networks and targeted in- vestor education to improve ﬁnancial decision-making. Evidence that individuals who choose to open retail brokerage accounts do not always make wise investment choices (e.g., Barber and Odean (2013)). For many individuals, however, their primary exposure to ﬁnancial investments is through employer-sponsored plans into which they do not directly self-select. These investors could be even less experienced and more prone to mistakes than the average retail investor. Alternatively, workplace networks could provide conduits through which employees learn, resulting in better decision-making. We use novel panel data on employee decisions within employee stock pur- chase plans (ESPPs) to examine how ﬁnancial information spreads through employee networks.

    "title": "Learning, Asset-Pricing Tests,",
    "abstract": "This paper studies the asset-pricing implications of parameter uncertainty. We show that, when investors must learn about expected cash flows, empirical tests can find patterns in the data that differ from those perceived by rational investors. Returns might appear predictable to an econometrician, or appear to deviate from the Capital Asset Pricing Model, but investors can neither perceive nor exploit this predictability. Returns may also appear excessively volatile even though prices react efficiently to cash-flow news. We conclude that parameter uncertainty can be important for characterizing and testing market efficiency. There IS Much Evidence That Stock Returns are predictable. At the aggregate level, variables such as interest rates, financial ratios, and the default pre- mium appear to forecast stock returns (e.g., Fama and French (1989) and Lewellen (2001)). Further, LeRoy and Porter (1981) and Shiller (1981) argue that price volatility cannot be explained solely by changes in dividends, pro- viding indirect evidence that stock returns are predictable. At the firm level, Fama and French (1992, 1996) and Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) show that size, book-to-market, and past returns together explain much of the cross- sectional variation in average returns. There seems little doubt that ex- pected returns vary both cross-sectionally and over time. The interpretation of predictability is more contentious. The empirical re- sults are potentially consistent with either mark",

    "abstract": "This paper examines the role of legal investor protection for the efﬁciency of the market for corporate control when bidders are ﬁnancially constrained. In the model, stronger legal investor protection increases bidders’ outside funding capacity . How- ever, absent effective bidding competition, this does not improve efﬁciency , as the bid price, and thus bidders’ need for funds, increases one-for-one with the pledgeable income. In contrast, under effective competition for the target, the increased outside funding capacity improves efﬁciency by making it less likely that more efﬁcient but less wealthy bidders are outbid by less efﬁcient but wealthier rivals. Building ON THE WORKof La Porta et al. (1997,1998), several empirical studies show that countries with stronger legal investor protection allocate resources more efﬁciently . For instance, Wurgler (2000) shows that these countries in- crease investment more in growing industries, and decrease investment more in declining industries, compared to countries with weaker legal investor pro- tection. Similarly , McLean, Zhang, and Zhao (2012) show that ﬁrms in these countries exhibit a higher sensitivity of investment to growth opportunities and consequently enjoy higher total factor productivity growth and higher proﬁtability . An important resource allocation mechanism is the takeover market. In the takeover market, both assets and managerial talent are reallocated across ﬁrms and industries.

Using two plausibly exogenous shocks to expected penalties, we show that insiders trade less aggressively and earlier and concentrate on tips of greater value when facing a higher risk. The results match the predictions of a model where an insider internalizes the impact of trades on prices and the likelihood of prosecution and anticipates penalties in proportion to trade proﬁts. Our ﬁndings lend support to the effectiveness of U.S. Regulations’ deterrence and the long-standing hypothesis that insider trading enforcement can hamper price informativeness.

    "abstract": "We examine how the informational structure of loan markets interacts with banks’ strategic behavior in determining lending standards, lending volume, and the aggre- gate allocation of credit. We show that, as banks obtain private information about borrowers and information asymmetries across banks decrease, banks may loosen their lending standards, leading to an equilibrium with deteriorated bank portfolios, lower profits, and expanded aggregate credit. These lower standards are associated with greater aggregate surplus and greater risk of financial instability. We therefore provide an explanation for the sequence of financial liberalization, lending booms, and banking crises observed in many emerging markets. Banks Perform THE Important Role OF Limiting adverse selection problems in the economy by screening out applicant borrowers that do not meet satisfactory lending standards. Failure to adequately perform this function leads to riskier portfolios and weaker balance sheets, with potentially negative consequences for the stability of credit markets. The focus of this paper is on how the dis- tribution of information about borrowers across banks interacts with banks’ strategic behavior in determining lending standards, lending volume, and the aggregate allocation of credit. Our analysis shows that changes in the information structure of the market can have a significant impact on the likelihood of a banking crisis.

    "abstract": "Governments regulate debt collectors to protect consumers from predatory practices. These restrictions may lower repayment, reducing the supply of mainstream credit and increasing demand for alternative credit. Using individual credit record data and a difference-in-differences design comparing consumers in states that tighten restrictions on debt collection to those in neighboring states that do not, I ﬁnd that restricting collections reduces access to mainstream credit and increases payday bor- rowing. These ﬁndings provide new evidence of substitution between alternative and mainstream credit and point to a trade-off between shielding consumers from certain collection practices and pushing them into higher cost payday lending markets. Financial Distress IS Pervasive Among American consumers. As of December 2016, over $600 billion of outstanding household debt was past due and two-thirds of those balances were at least 90 days late (frbny (2016)). When facing unmet payments, creditors commonly turn to debt collectors to minimize their losses. Collection agencies recovered nearly $79 billion from millions of consumers in 2016 (ACA International (2017)).

    "title": "Level Playing Fields in International Financial",
    "abstract": "We analyze the desirability of level playing fields in international financial regula- tion. In general, level playing fields impose the standards of the weakest regulator upon the best-regulated economies. However, they may be desirable when capital is mobile because they counter acherry-picking effect that lowers the size and efficiency of banks in weaker economies. Hence, while a laissez faire policy favors the better- regulated economy, level playing fields are good for weaker regulators. We show that multinational banking mitigates the cherry-picking effect, and reduces the damage that a level playing field causes in the better-regulated economy. AN Important Theme IN Recent Discussions of financial regulation has been the desirability of an internationally level playing field. For example, the desire to establish a level playing field in bank capital requirements was one of the driv- ing forces behind the 1988 Basel Accord, and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (1999, p. 10) remains committed to the principle of a level playing field. Advocates of the level playing field argue that it improves global welfare by ensuring that institutions in different countries are subject to the same regu- lations, meaning that internationally active financial institutions will compete on an equal footing, and hence that the more efficient institutions will gain a larger market share. In this paper we examine the costs and benefits of impos- ing a level playing field. We draw a",

    "abstract": "We model the debt and asset risk choice of a manager with performance-insensitive pay (cash) and performance-sensitive pay (stock) to theoretically link compensation structure, leverage, and credit spreads. The model predicts that optimal leverage trades off the tax beneﬁt of debt against the utility cost of ex-post asset substitution and that credit spreads are increasing in the ratio of cash-to-stock. Using a large cross- section of U.S.-based corporate credit default swaps (CDS) covering 2001 to 2006, we ﬁnd a positive association between cash-to-stock and CDS rates, and between cash- to-stock and leverage ratios. CEO Compensation Typically Includes both performance-sensitive and performance-insensitive components. This pay structure can be readily ratio- nalized in a contracting setting (e.g., Holmstrom (1982)). Performance-sensitive payments link a manager’s value-enhancing actions to his wealth, thereby aligning his incentives with those of the ﬁrm. These payments are risky, how- ever, and in contracts with a risk-averse manager risk-sharing motives give rise to a role for the performance-insensitive component.

    "abstract": "We characterize equilibrium leverage dynamics in a trade-off model in which the ﬁrm can continuously adjust leverage and cannot commit to a policy ex ante. While the leverage ratchet effect leads shareholders to issue debt gradually over time, asset growth and debt maturity cause leverage to mean-revert slowly toward a target. In- vestors anticipate future debt issuance and raise credit spreads, fully offsetting the tax beneﬁts of new debt. Shareholders are therefore indifferent toward the debt ma- turity structure, even though their choice signiﬁcantly affects credit spreads, leverage levels, the speed of adjustment, future investment, and growth. Understanding THE Determinants OF A Firm ’S Capital structure and how its leverage is likely to evolve over time is one of the central questions in corporate ﬁnance. Leverage and its expected dynamics are crucial to valuing the ﬁrm, assessing its credit risk, and pricing its ﬁnancial claims. Forecasting the optimal response of leverage to shocks is necessary to anticipate the likely consequences of a crisis and its aftermath, and to evaluate alternative policy responses. Despite its importance, a fully satisfactory theory of leverage dynamics has yet to be identiﬁed.

    "abstract": "I develop a structural model of mortgage demand and lender competition to study how leverage regulation affects the U.K. Mortgage market. Using variation in risk- weighted capital requirements across lenders and mortgages with different loan-to- values (LTVs), I show that a 1-percentage-point increase in risk-weighted capital requirements increases lenders’ marginal cost of originating mortgages by about 26 basis points (11%) on average. I use the estimated model to study proposed leverage regulations. Counterfactual analyses show that large lenders exploit a regulatory cost advantage, which increases concentration by about 20%, and suggest that banning high-LTV mortgages may reduce large lenders’ equity buffer. AS A Result OF THE Global ﬁnancial crisis, several European countries and the United States introducednew regulations to prevent excessive bank lever- age and increase the stability of the ﬁnancial system.

    "title": "Leverage and the Cross-Section of Equity",
    "abstract": "Building on theoretical asset pricing literature, we examine the role of market risk and the size, book-to-market (BTM), and volatility anomalies in the cross-section of unlevered equity returns. Compared with levered (stock) returns, unlevered market beta plays a more important role in explaining the cross-section of unlevered equity returns, even after controlling for size and BTM. The size effect is weakened, while the value premium and the volatility puzzle virtually disappear for unlevered returns. We show that leverage induces heteroskedasticity in returns. Unlevering returns removes this pattern, which is otherwise difﬁcult to address by controlling for leverage in regressions. HOW Does Financial Leverage AFFECTthe cross-section of equity returns? Apart from being of intrinsic interest, this question is also relevant because of its relation to well-documented stylized facts on the cross-section of stock returns: the inability of the unconditional market model to explain the cross-section of stock returns (Fama and French (1992)) and the robust presence of a wide variety of anomalies. In this paper, we focus on unconditional market risk and three important anomalies: the size discount (Banz (1981), Fama and French (1992)), the value premium (Rosenberg, Reid, and Lanstein (1985), Fama and French (1992)),1 and the negative cross-sectional relation between volatility and returns known as the volatility puzzle (Ang et al.

    "abstract": "Financial ﬁrms raise short-term debt to ﬁnance asset purchases; this induces risk shifting when economic conditions worsen and limits their ability to roll over debt. Constrained ﬁrms de-lever by selling assets to lower-leverage ﬁrms. In turn, asset–market liquidity depends on the system-wide distribution of leverage, which is itself endogenous to future economic prospects. Good economic prospects yield cheaper short-term debt, inducing entry of higher-leverage ﬁrms. Consequently, adverse asset shocks in good times lead to greater de-leveraging and sudden drying up of market and funding liquidity. Where DID ALL the liquidity go? Six months ago, everybody was talking about boundless global liquidity supporting risky assets, driving risk premiums to virtually nothing, and now everybody is talking about a global liquidity crunch, driving risk premiums half the distance to the moon. Tell me, Mac, where did all the liquidity go? Paul McCulley, Pimco Investment Outlook, Summer 2007 We argue that the build-up of leverage in the ﬁnancial sector in good economic times helps explain why adverse asset shocks in such times are associated with a severe drying up of liquidity and with deep discounts in asset prices.

    "title": "Leveraged Funds and the Shadow Cost of",
    "abstract": "Using the most comprehensive data set of leveraged funds known to the literature, we measure the market-wide shadow cost of leverage constraints and examine its pricing implications. The shadow cost averages 0.53% per annum from 2006 to 2016, spikes upon quarter-ends when banks face tighter capital requirements, positively predicts future betting-against-beta (BAB) returns, and negatively correlates with contempo- raneous BAB returns. Stocks that experience lower returns when the shadow cost in- creases earn 0.85% more per month. Overall, our shadow cost measure ﬁts the predic- tions of leverage-constraint-based theories better than the widely used TED spread. WE Propose A NEW Empirical measure for the shadow cost of leverage constraints. The shadow cost measures the tightness of marginal investors’ leverage constraints and is increasingly considered a key determinant of as- set prices.1 Examining the theoretical asset pricing implications of the shadow cost of leverage constraints requires an accurate empirical measure, which has remained elusive so far. As Garleanu and Pedersen (2011) demonstrate, the shadow cost is the difference between marginal investors’ funding cost and the risk-free rate when the credit risk of the funding is zero (or fully hedged). Con- structing an appropriate measure for the shadow cost therefore requires both win Choi; Robert Hodrick; John Hund; Shiyang Huang; Inkoo Kang; Johannes Kohler; Sylvia Jablonski; Andrea Lu; Asaf Manela; Harry Mamaysky; S",

    "title": "Levered Returns",
    "abstract": "This paper revisits the theoretical relation between ﬁnancial leverage and stock re- turns in a dynamic world where both corporate investment and ﬁnancing decisions are endogenous. We ﬁnd that the link between leverage and stock returns is more complex than static textbook examples suggest, and depends on the investment op- portunities available to the ﬁrm. In the presence of ﬁnancial market imperfections, leverage and investment are generally correlated so that highly levered ﬁrms are also mature ﬁrms with relatively more (safe) book assets and fewer (risky) growth op- portunities. A quantitative version of our model matches several stylized facts about leverage and returns. Standard Finance Textbooks Propose a relatively straightforward link be- tween capital structure and the expected returns on equity: Increases in ﬁnan- cial leverage directly increase the risk of the cash ﬂows to equity holders and thus raise the required rate of return on equity. This remarkably simple idea has proved extremely powerful and has been used by countless researchers and practitioners to examine returns and measure the cost of capital across and within ﬁrms with varying capital structures. Unfortunately, despite, or perhaps because of, its extreme clarity, this re- lation between leverage and returns has met with, at best, mixed empirical success. We thus have evidence that equity returns: 1. Rise with market leverage (e.g., Bhandari (1988) and Fama and French (1992)), 2. Are insensitive or",

    "abstract": "We study pre-trade transparency by looking at the introduction of NYSE’s OpenBook service that provides limit-order book information to traders off the exchange floor. We find that traders attempt to manage limit-order exposure: They submit smaller orders and cancel orders faster. Specialists’ participation rate and the depth they add to the quote decline. Liquidity increases in that the price impact of orders declines, and we find some improvement in the informational efficiency of prices. These results suggest that an increase in pre-trade transparency affects investors’ trading strategies and can improve certain dimensions of market quality. THE Proliferation OF NEW Exchanges and trading platforms in the United States and abroad brings to the forefront many issues in market design. Should a market have at its core an electronic limit-order book? What possible roles can market makers play? What information should market participants observe about order flow and prices? These issues have implications for investor trading strategies, specialist behavior, market liquidity, the informational efficiency of prices, and ultimately for investor welfare. We investigate a key feature of market design: transparency, or the ability of market participants to observe information in the trading process. Our focus is on a particular form of transparency: the ability of market par- ticipants to observe the pending trading interests of other participants, or in other words, the content of th",

    "title": "Limited Arbitrage in Equity Markets",
    "abstract": "We examine 82 situations where the market value of a company is less than its subsidiary. These situations imply arbitrage opportunities, providing an ideal set- ting to study the risks and market frictions that prevent arbitrageurs from imme- diately forcing prices to fundamental values. For 30 percent of the sample, the link between the parent and its subsidiary is severed before the relative value discrep- ancy is corrected. Furthermore, returns to a specialized arbitrageur would be 50 per- cent larger if the path to convergence was smooth rather than as observed. Uncertainty about the distribution of returns and characteristics of the risks lim- its arbitrage. This Paper Examines Impediments to arbitrage in equity markets using a sample of 82 situations between 1985 and 2000, where the market value of a com- pany is less than that of its ownership stake in a publicly traded subsidiary. These situations suggest clear arbitrage opportunities, yet, they often persist, and therefore provide an interesting setting in which to study the risks and market frictions that prevent arbitrageurs from quickly forcing prices to fundamental values. Arbitrage is one of the central tenets of financial economics, enforcing the law of one price and keeping markets efficient. In its purest form, arbitrage requires no capital and is risk free (see Dybvig and Ross (1992)). By simul- taneously selling and purchasing identical securities at favorably different prices, the arbitrageur captures an",

    "title": "Limited Attention and the Allocation of Effort",
    "abstract": "While limited attention has been analyzed in a variety of economic and psychological settings, its impact on financial markets is not well understood. In this paper, we examine individual Nyse specialist portfolios and test whether liquidity provision is affected as specialists allocate their attention across stocks. Our results indicate that specialists allocate effort toward their most active stocks during periods of increased activity, resulting in less frequent price improvement and increased transaction costs for their remaining assigned stocks. Thus, the allocation of effort due to limited at- tention has a significant impact on liquidity provision in securities markets. Substantial Evidence Suggests That Humans are limited in their ability to process information and to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. Kahneman (1973) argues that this type of “limited attention” requires individuals to allocate their cognitive resources across tasks, so that attention spent on one task must reduce attention available for other tasks. 1 In this paper, we test whether limited attention affects the specialist’s ability to provide liquidity for securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange (nyse). Early work related to attention in the finance literature focuses on the in- formation available to investors. For example, Merton (1987) analyzes market equilibrium in a setting where investors know about only a subset of securities. More recently, several theoretical and empirical studi",

    "title": "Limited Investment Capital and Credit Spreads",
    "abstract": "Using proprietary credit default swap (CDS) data, I investigate how capital shocks at protection sellers impact pricing in the CDS market. Seller capital shocks—measured as CDS portfolio margin payments—account for 12% of the time-series variation in weekly spread changes, a signiﬁcant amount given that standard credit factors account for 18% during my sample. In addition, seller shocks possess information for spreads that is independent of institution-wide measures of constraints. These ﬁndings imply a high degree of market segmentation, and suggest that frictions within specialized ﬁnancial institutions prevent capital from ﬂowing into the market at shorter horizons. A Core Assumption IN Neoclassical Asset Pricing theories is that capital can al- ways ﬂow frictionlessly to investment opportunities. Yet for many asset classes there are barriers to capital entry because investment requires specialized knowledge and technology, or capital itself may be scarce due to agency prob- lems. For instance, ﬁnancial institutions that participate in derivatives mar- kets must have access to a steady source of funding, employ traders that have the requisite knowledge to properly evaluate risk, and possess the infrastruc- ture to execute and process trades. Moreover, within ﬁnancial institutions, internal capital market frictions can impede the ﬂow of investment resources in the short run. In particular, while many ﬁnancial institutions are active in a number of different asset classes, t",

    "abstract": "Limited stock market participation can potentially explain the disconnect between in- ternational asset prices and macro quantities. An incomplete markets model in which risk sharing for stockholders is high generates highly correlated equity returns and relatively smooth exchange rates. Risk sharing for nonstockholders is limited because of their nonparticipation in stock markets and borrowing constraints, reducing the aggregate consumption correlation and the correlation between aggregate consump- tion differentials and exchange rates. Financial integration widens the disconnect by beneﬁting stockholders but hurting nonstockholders. Survey data indicate that international risk sharing for stockholders is better than that for nonstockholders, consistent with the predictions. International Asset Prices AND Quantities are disconnected. In the post–Bretton Woods period, quarterly equity returns of the United States have a correlation of 0.7 with those of the United Kingdom, whereas the corre- lation between the ﬁnancial income of the two countries is 0.14 and that of nondurable consumption growth is 0.18. This large spread between the cross- country equity correlation and consumption correlation is known as the inter- national equity premium puzzle. Similarly , the correlation between the differ- ences in home and foreign aggregate consumption growth rates (or consump- tion differentials) and real exchange rate changes is−0.06 between the United States and United Kingdom, where",

    "abstract": "“Limits of Arbitrage” theories hypothesize that the marginal investor in a particular asset market is a specialized arbitrageur rather than a diversified representative investor. We examine the mortgage-backed securities (MBS) market in this light. We show that the risk of homeowner prepayment, which is a wash in the aggregate, is priced in the MBS market. The covariance of prepayment risk with aggregate wealth implies the wrong sign to match the observed prices of prepayment risk. The price of risk is better explained by a kernel based on MBS market-wide specific risk, consistent with the specialized arbitrageur hypothesis. A Number OF Recent “limits of arbitrage” theories predict that the distressed liquidation of assets by hedge funds results in a large drop in asset prices (see, for example, Shleifer and Vishny (1997), Kyle and Xiong (2001), Gromb and Vayanos (2002), Geanakoplos (2003), or He and Krishnamurthy (2006)). These theories are often referenced in explaining episodes of market illiquidity and falling asset prices, such as the events during the fall of 1998. In traditional asset pricing theory, the marginal investor in every asset mar- ket is the same broadly diversified representative investor. Thus, a hedge fund liquidating $200 billion of mortgage-backed securities finds a large pool of ready buyers (comparable to the entire capital market), and the liquidation does not affect expected returns because the representative investor acts quickly to elim- inate exc",

    "title": "Linear-Rational Term Structure Models",
    "abstract": "We introduce the class of linear-rational term structure models in which the state price density is modeled such that bond prices become linear-rational functions of the factors. This class is highly tractable with several distinct advantages: (i) ensures non- negative interest rates, (ii) easily accommodates unspanned factors affecting volatility and risk premiums, and (iii) admits semi-analytical solutions to swaptions. A parsimo- nious model speciﬁcation within the linear-rational class has a very good ﬁt to both interest rate swaps and swaptions since 1997 and captures many features of term structure, volatility, and risk premium dynamics—including when interest rates are close to the zero lower bound. THE Current Environment With Very low interest rates creates difﬁculties for many existing term structure models, most notably Gaussian or conditionally Gaussian models that invariably place large probabilities on negative future interest rates. Models that respect the zero lower bound (ZLB) on interest rates exist but often have limited ability to accommodate unspanned factors affecting volatility and risk premiums or to price many types of interest rate derivatives.

    "abstract": "This paper shows that the liquidation value of collateral depends on the interdepen- dency between borrower and collateral risk. Using transaction-level data on short- term repurchase agreements (repo), we show that borrowers pay a premium of 1.1 to 2.6 basis points when their default risk is positively correlated with the risk of the collateral that they pledge. Moreover, we show that borrowers internalize this pre- mium when making their collateral choices. Loan-level credit registry data suggest that the results extend to the corporate loan market as well. Collateral IS A KEY Component of a wide variety of loan contracts. It re- duces ﬁnancial constraints by increasing the borrower’s pledgeable income, as the lender can liquidate the collateral in case of default. As such, a crucial determinant of loan pricing is the liquidation value of collateral, that is, the expected value of the collateral conditional on borrower default. The higher the liquidation value, the lower the rate charged by the lender. The driver of liquidation value that receives most attention in the theo- retical and empirical literature is collateral redeployability (e.g., Williamson (1988), Benmelech, Garmaise, and Moskowitz (2005), Benmelech and Bergman (2009)). The higher the collateral redeployability , the more diverse the contexts in which the collateral can be exploited, and hence the higher the liquidation value.

    "abstract": "We study the propagation of financial crises among regions in which banks are pro- tected by limited liability and may take excessive risk. The regions are affected by negatively correlated liquidity shocks, so liquidity coinsurance is Pareto improving. The moral hazard problem can be solved if banks are sufficiently capitalized. Under autarky a limited amount of capital is sufficient to prevent risk-taking, but when fi- nancial markets are open capital becomes insufficient. Thus, bankruptcy occurs with positive probability and the crisis spreads to other regions via financial linkages. Opening financial markets is nevertheless Pareto improving; consumers benefit from liquidity coinsurance, although they pay the cost of excessive risk-taking. IT IS Sometimes Claimed That THE Opening of financial markets may increase the instability of financial systems. In this paper, we show that this claim may be correct, but that it does not necessarily imply that the creation of financial linkages across countries should be restrained. The main idea is as follows. Consider a two-region economy. In each region, the banking sector has access to long-term investment opportunities and con- sumers deposit their assets to the banks in order to exploit such opportunities. The two regions have negatively correlated liquidity needs, thus there are gains from trade from pooling financial resources, for example, through an interbank deposit market.

Traders face a trade-off between the beneﬁt of being ﬁrst to seize a proﬁt opportunity and the cost of attention required to be ﬁrst to seize this opportunity. The model provides an explanation for maker/taker pricing, and has implications for the effects of algorithmic trading on liquidity, volume, and welfare. Liquidity suppliers’ and liquidity demanders’ trading intensities reinforce each other, highlighting a new form of liquidity externalities. Data on durations between trades and quotes could be used to identify these externalities. THE Speed AT Which investors respond to trading opportunities is important for asset price dynamics. For example, Dufﬁe (2010) demonstrates that the price impact of supply and demand shocks is more persistent when new capital re- sponds slowly to these shocks. This effect manifests itself at various time scales, including the high frequency.1 In recent years, ﬁrms specializing in high fre- quency trading have made massive investments in hardware and algorithms to accelerate their response time to trading opportunities.

    "title": "Liquidity Externalities and Adverse Selection:",
    "abstract": "This paper examines liquidity externalities by analyzing trading costs after hours. There is less than 1/20 as many trades per unit time after hours as during the trading day. The reduced trading activity results in substantially higher trading costs: quoted and effective spreads are three to four times larger than during the trading day. The higher spreads reflect greater adverse selection and order persistence, but not higher dealer profits. Because liquidity provision remains competitive after hours, the greater adverse selection and higher trading costs provide a direct measure of the magnitude of the liquidity externalities generated during the trading day. Understanding Network Effects and liquidity externalities is one of the most important outstanding issues in market design (Madhavan (2000)) and mar- ket regulation (Macey and O’Hara (1999)). Liquidity externalities arise from bringing traders together in space and time to reduce search and trading costs. Bringing traders together creates liquidity externalities because the additional traders arriving in the marketplace reduce trading costs for all investors. To date, attention has focused almost exclusively on spatial network effects by ex- amining the trading of securities in different markets at the same time (Lee (1993), Hasbrouck (1995), and others). In contrast, this paper studies the effects of temporal consolidation of trades by analyzing trading during and outside of exchange trading hours. A well-known liqui",

    "title": "Liquidity Fluctuations in Over-the-Counter",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes a theory of excess price ﬂuctuations in over-the-counter sec- ondary markets. When heterogeneous assets trade under asymmetric information, a quality effect emerges: high liquidity lowers the quality of the pool of sellers and decreases future liquidity . Cyclical equilibria can arise even without fundamental shocks. In a cycle, investors speculate by bidding up the price of low-quality assets, anticipating a high resale price at the peak. When this resale effect is strong, cycles disappear and multiple steady states coexist with different levels of liquidity . The model rationalizes empirical patterns for corporate bonds and housing in particular. Asset Prices Often Appear Disconnected from fundamentals. This weak relationship shows as excess price ﬂuctuations, documented notably for cor- porate bonds and housing by Bao and Pan (2013) and Glaeser et al. (2014). Price deviations from fundamentals are sometimes extreme during speculative episodes when prices rapidly increase before crashing (see Cutler, Poterba, and Summers 1991).

    "title": "Liquidity Premia and Transaction Costs",
    "abstract": "Standard literature concludes that transaction costs only have a second-order effect on liquidity premia. We show that this conclusion depends crucially on the assumption of a constant investment opportunity set. In a regime-switching model in which the investment opportunity set varies over time, we explicitly characterize the optimal consumption and investment strategy. In contrast to the standard literature, we find that transaction costs can have a ﬁrst-order effect on liquidity premia. However, with reasonably calibrated parameters, the presence of transaction costs still cannot fully explain the equity premium puzzle. Transaction Costs ARE Prevalent in almost all financial markets. Extensive re- search has been conducted on the optimal consumption and investment policy in the presence of transaction costs since the seminal work of Constantinides (1979, 1986). The presence of transaction costs significantly changes optimal consumption and investment strategies. For example, in the presence of trans- action costs, continuous trade incurs infinite transaction costs, and thus even a small transaction cost can dramatically decrease the frequency of trade. How- ever, most studies find that the utility loss due to the presence of transaction costs is small. In particular, Constantinides (1986) finds that the liquidity pre- mium (i.e., the maximum expected return an investor is willing to exchange for zero transaction cost) is small relative to the transaction cost, even for a",

    "abstract": "We examine the influence of Nyse specialist firm organizational form on the na- ture of liquidity provision. We compare closely held firms whose specialists provide liquidity with their own capital to widely held firms whose specialists provide liquidity with diffusely owned capital. We argue that specialists using their own capital have a greater incentive and ability to reduce adverse selection costs, but face a greater cost of capital. Differences in the proportion of spreads due to ad- verse selection costs, large trade frequency, the sensitivity between depth and spreads, and price stabilization support this argument. Recent Studies BY CAO, Choe, and Hatheway (1997) and Corwin (1999a) doc- ument differences across specialist firms in execution costs, trading halts due to order imbalances, and market stabilization. Why these differences in liquidity provision exist, however, is not well understood. We argue that dif- ferences in liquidity provision arise from differences in specialist firm orga- nizational form; firms that make markets with capital supplied by their specialists (owner-specialist firms) offer economies with respect to asymmet- ric information costs, while firms that make markets with diffusely owned capital (employee-specialist firms) offer economies with respect to capital costs. Our empirical results support this argument. Since March 1997, the Nyse has allowed listing firms to choose which specialist firm handles their stock from a pool provided by the",

    "title": "Liquidity Risk and the Dynamics",
    "abstract": "We develop a continuous-time model of liquidity provision in which hedgers can trade multiple risky assets with arbitrageurs. Arbitrageurs have constant relative risk- aversion (crra) utility, while hedgers’ asset demand is independent of wealth. An increase in hedgers’ risk aversion can make arbitrageurs endogenously more risk- averse. Because arbitrageurs generate endogenous risk, an increase in their wealth or a reduction in their Crra coefﬁcient can raise risk premia despite Sharpe ratios de- clining. Arbitrageur wealth is a priced risk factor because assets held by arbitrageurs offer high expected returns but suffer the most when wealth drops. Aggregate illiq- uidity, which declines in wealth, captures that factor. Liquidity IN Financial Markets IS Often provided by specialized agents such as market makers, trading desks in investment banks, and hedge funds. Adverse shocks to the capital of these agents cause liquidity to decline and risk premia to increase. Conversely, movements in the prices of assets held by liquidity providers feed back into these agents’ capital. 1 Dreschler; Nicolae Garleanu; Florian Heider; Pete Kyle; Stavros Panageas; Anna Pavlova; Jean- Charles Rochet; Wei Xiong; Hongjun Yan; an anonymous Associate Editor; two anonymous referees; seminar participants at Atlanta Fed, Bank of Canada, Cass, Columbia, Copenhagen, Duke, HKU, Imperial, LBS, LSE, Minneapolis Fed, Montreal, NUS, Ohio State, Tinbergen, Uiuc, UNC, Wash U, Wharton, and Zurich; and particip",

    "abstract": "Weshow in this article that bank failures can be contagious. Unlike earlier work where contagion stems from depositor panics or contractual links between banks, we argue that bank failures can shrink the common pool of liquidity, creating, or exacerbating aggregate liquidity shortages. This could lead to a contagion of failures and a total meltdown of the system. Given the costs of a meltdown, there is a possible role for government intervention. Unfortunately, liquidity and solvency problems interact and can cause each other, making it hard to determine the cause of a crisis. We propose a robust sequence of intervention. These crises have long been debated. Do they stem from depositor panics or do they arise because bank balance sheets are exposed to common factors? If it is the latter, then is there any sense in which bank failures can be contagious? Can anything be done to prevent these crises or stop them from propagating once they begin? Our purpose in this paper is to reexamine whether bank failures can start and propagate systemic crises even if we assume that depositors do not panic, that is, even if depositors’ actions are coordinated and they do not run simply because they fear others will run. Our focus is not because we think that panics are empirically unimportant (the jury is still out on that). Instead, we show that contagion can stem from an underlying real general equilibrium problem rather than just from lack of coordination among depositors. From a policy p",

    "abstract": "This paper examines dealer inventory capacity, or liquidity supply, as a driver of liquidity and expected returns in the corporate bond market. We identify shocks to aggregate liquidity supply using data on corporate bond yields and dealer positions. Liquidity supply shocks lead to persistent changes in market liquidity, are correlated with proxies for dealer ﬁnancial constraints, and have signiﬁcant explanatory power for cross-sectional and time-series variation in expected returns, beyond standard risk factors. Our ﬁndings point to liquidity supply by ﬁnancially constrained inter- mediaries as a main driver of market liquidity and asset prices. Liquidity Risk IS Priced IN the cross section of asset returns: average re- turns are higher for assets more sensitive to aggregate shocks to market liq- uidity. The liquidity risk premium has been documented in equities (Amihud (2002), Pástor and Stambaugh (2003)), corporate bonds (Lin, Wang, and Wu (2011)), and other asset classes (Sadka (2010)).

    "abstract": "Liquidity transformation, a key role of banks, is thought to increase fragility, as unin- sured depositors face an incentive to withdraw money before others (a so-called panic run). Despite much theoretical work, however, there is little empirical evidence es- tablishing this mechanism. In this paper, we provide the ﬁrst large-scale evidence of this mechanism. Banks that engage in more liquidity transformation exhibit higher fragility, as captured by stronger sensitivities of uninsured deposit ﬂows to bank per- formance and greater levels of uninsured deposit outﬂows when performance is poor. We also explore the effects of deposit insurance and systemic risk. ONE OF THE KEY Functions of banks is liquidity transformation. Banks hold illiquid assets, such as loans and illiquid securities, and ﬁnance themselves with highly liquid liabilities, such as demand deposits and other forms of short- term debt. This liquidity transformation plays a critical role in the economy, allowing the ﬁnancing of long-term illiquid investments while satisfying the demand for liquid money-like assets by investors. However, a large body of economic theory going back to Diamond and Dybvig (1983) suggests that such liquidity transformation can make banks inherently fragile, as they do not al- ways hold sufﬁcient liquid assets to meet the immediate withdrawal demands from comments by Amit Seru (the Editor); an Associate Editor; two anonymous reviewers; and Journal of Finance disclosure policy.

    "title": "Liquidity and Autocorrelations in Individual",
    "abstract": "This paper documents a strong relationship between short-run reversals and stock illiquidity, even after controlling for trading volume. The largest reversals and the po- tential contrarian trading strategy profits occur in high turnover, low liquidity stocks, as the price pressures caused by non-informational demands for immediacy are ac- commodated. However, the contrarian trading strategy profits are smaller than the likely transactions costs. This lack of profitability and the fact that the overall find- ings are consistent with rational equilibrium paradigms suggest that the violation of the efficient market hypothesis due to short-term reversals is not so egregious after all. Asset Prices Should Follow A Martingale Process over short horizons as sys- tematic short-run changes in fundamental values should be negligible in an efficient market with unpredictable information arrival. However, Lehmann (1990) and Jegadeesh (1990) show that contrarian strategies that exploit the short-run return reversals in individual stocks generate abnormal returns of about 1.7% per week and 2.5% per month, respectively. Subsequently, Ball, Kothari, and Wasley (1995) and Conrad, Gultekin, and Kaul (1997) suggest that much of such reversal profitability is within the bid–ask bounce. Theoret- ically, the potential role of liquidity in explaining the high abnormal payoffs to short-run contrarian strategies is implied by the rational equilibrium frame- work of Campbell, Grossman, and Wang (1993",

    "abstract": "We develop a structural bond valuation model to simultaneously capture liquidity and credit risk. Our model implies that renegotiation in financial distress is influenced by the illiquidity of the market for distressed debt. As default becomes more likely, the components of bond yield spreads attributable to illiquidity increase. When we consider finite maturity debt, we find decreasing and convex term structures of liq- uidity spreads. Using bond price data spanning 15 years, we find evidence of a positive correlation between the illiquidity and default components of yield spreads as well as support for downward-sloping term structures of liquidity spreads. Credit Risk AND Liquidity Risk Have Long been perceived as two of the main jus- tifications for the existence of yield spreads above benchmark Treasury notes or bonds (see Fisher (1959)). Since Merton (1974), a rapidly growing body of literature has focused on credit risk. 1 However, while concern about market liquidity issues has become increasingly marked since the autumn of 1998, 2 liquidity remains a relatively unexplored topic, in particular, liquidity for de- faultable securities. This paper develops a structural bond pricing model with liquidity and credit risk. The purpose is to enhance our understanding of both the interaction be- tween these two sources of risk and their relative contributions to the yield spreads on corporate bonds.

    "title": "Liquidity and the Law of One Price: The Case",
    "abstract": "Deviations from no-arbitrage relations should be related to market liquidity, because liquidity facilitates arbitrage. At the same time, a wide futures-cash basis may trig- ger arbitrage trades and, in turn, affect liquidity. We test these ideas by studying the dynamic relation between stock market liquidity and the index futures basis. There is evidence of two-way Granger causality between the short-term absolute basis and liquidity, and liquidity Granger-causes longer-term absolute bases. Shocks to the ab- solute basis predict future stock market liquidity. The evidence suggests that liquidity enhances the efficiency of the futures-cash pricing system. THE LAW OF ONE Price is a fundamental building block of modern financial theory. Indeed, several well-known pricing relations in finance depend on the notion that two traded or synthesized instruments with the same future cash flows should trade at the same price. In practice, of course, market microstructure as- pects may cause a temporary deviation of prices from their no-arbitrage values. For example, extreme order imbalances in a cash market may create inventory problems for market makers and cause temporary deviations of cash prices from the corresponding no-arbitrage prices implied by derivative markets. Finance scholars have long recognized that deviations from no-arbitrage re- lations are related to the frictions associated with transacting, in particular to (il)liquidity indicators such as the bid–ask spread.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a theory of liquidity dynamics. Illiquidity results from asymmet- ric information. Observing the historical track record teaches agents how to interpret public information and helps overcome information asymmetry. However, an illiquid- ity trap can arise: too much asymmetric information leads to the breakdown of trade, which interrupts learning and perpetuates illiquidity. Liquidity falls in response to unexpected events that lead agents to question their valuation models (especially in newer markets) may be slow to recover after a crisis, and is higher in periods of stability. This Paper Proposes A Theory OF Market LIQUIDITYand its evolution over time. This theory is based on the interaction between information asymmetry and social learning. Liquidity is an elusive concept, with the literature on it plagued by challenges of both deﬁnition and measurement.1 In this paper, I refer to the following notion of liquidity: The liquidity of an asset class is the fraction of the potential gains from trade in that asset class that are realized in equilibrium. If the potential gains from trade are large, it is tautologically true that asset liquidity has important consequences for social welfare. The theory in this paper is based on a minor modiﬁcation of an otherwise standard model of trade under asymmetric information in the spirit of Akerlof (1970). The assumption is that rather than being purely uninformed, asset buyers have access to some information, but their",

TBA trading creates liquidity by allowing thousands of different MBS to be traded in a handful of TBA contracts. SPs that are eligible to be traded as TBAs have signiﬁcantly lower trading costs than other SPs. We present evidence that TBA eligibility, in addition to characteristics of TBA-eligible SPs, lowers trading costs. We show that dealers hedge SP inventory with TBA trades, and they are more likely to prearrange trades in SPs that are difﬁcult to hedge. THE Market FOR Agency Mortgage -backed securities (MBS) is among the largest, most active, and most liquid of all securities markets. At ﬁrst glance, the market’s liquidity is surprising because each MBS is unique and is com- posed of speciﬁc mortgages with their own prepayment characteristics. In this paper, we study the institutional feature of this market that allows it to work so well, namely, parallel trading in a to-be-announced (TBA) forward market in MBS and a speciﬁed pool (SP) market in which speciﬁc MBS are traded. TBA trading makes the agency MBS market liquid in three ways. First, the TBA market takes thin markets for thousands of different MBS with different prepayment characteristics and trades them through a handful of thickly traded cheapest-to-deliver contracts. In this way, liquidity is increased for the MBS that are traded there instead of as SPs. Second,",

    "title": "Liquidity or Credit Risk? The Determinants",
    "abstract": "Employing a comprehensive database on transactions of commercial paper issued by domestic U.S. Nonfinancial corporations, we study the determinants of very short- term corporate yield spreads. We find that liquidity plays a role in the determination of spreads but, somewhat surprisingly, credit quality is the more important determinant of spreads, even at horizons of less than 1 month. These results are robust across a variety of proxies for liquidity and credit risk, and have important implications for the literature on the modeling of corporate bond prices. THE Seminal Paper BY Merton (1974) Provides a basic structural framework for valuing defaultable corporate debt. One of the principal strengths of the Merton approach is that it makes clear causal links between the price of a firm’s debt and observables, thus providing specific testable predictions. However, the em- pirical evidence for the model and various of its extensions is mixed. For ex- ample, Sarig and Warga (1989) use a sample of long-term discount bonds to demonstrate that yield spreads vary with maturity in a manner that is roughly consistent with Merton’s model, but Helwege and Turner (1999) argue that this result is an artifact of the method used to construct the corporate term structures. 1 Moreover, while direct tests of Merton-style models find that the models seriously underpredict the level of long-term corporate bond spreads (Jones, Mason, and Rosenfeld (1984), Ogden (1987), Collin-Dufresne, Goldstein,",

    "abstract": "Central bank balance sheet expansion, through actions like quantitative easing, is run through commercial banks. While this increases liquid central bank reserves held on commercial bank balance sheets, demandable uninsured deposits issued to ﬁnance the reserves also increase. Subsequent shrinkage in the central bank balance sheet may entail shrinkage in bank-held reserves without a commensurate reduction in deposit claims. Furthermore, during episodes of liquidity stress, when many claims on liquidity are called, surplus banks may hoard reserves. As a result, central bank balance sheet expansion may create less additional liquidity than typically thought, and indeed, may increase the probability and severity of episodes of liquidity stress. Despite A Significant Expansion IN central bank balance sheets, some markets like the U.S. Money market have experienced increasing interest rate volatility , including alarming spikes in the repo rate, notably in Decem- ber 2018 and September 2019 (see D’Avernas and Vandeweyer (2021)).

    "abstract": "We examine the dynamics of liquidity using a comprehensive sample of U.S. Stocks in the post-decimalization period. Motivated by a continuous-time inventory model, we compute a high-frequency measure of order imbalance volatility to proxy for the inventory risk faced by liquidity providers. We show that high-frequency order im- balance volatility is an important driver of liquidity and explains the often positive time-series relation between spread and volume for large stocks, which seems to run counter to most theoretical models. Furthermore, order imbalance volatility is priced in the cross-section of stock returns. WE Investigate THE Time -series Relation between stocks’ trading cost, volume, volatility, and order imbalance volatility. Understanding their joint dy- namics is important for asset managers, who need to manage the illiquidity of their portfolios.1 It is also interesting for academics to distinguish between var- ious determinants of stock illiquidity. In market microstructure theory, trading costs arise primarily to compensate liquidity providers (LPs) for adverse selec- tion risk (e.g., Glosten and Milgrom ( 1985), Kyle ( 1985)) and inventory risk (Stoll ( 1978b)).

    "abstract": "Firms raise money from banks and the bond market. Banks sell loans in a secondary market to recycle their funds or to trade on private information. Liquidity in the loan market depends on the relative likelihood of each motive for trade and affects firms’ optimal financial structure. The endogenous degree of liquidity is not always socially optimal: There is excessive trade in highly rated names, and insufficient liquidity in riskier bonds. We provide testable implications for prices and quantities in primary and secondary loan markets, and bond markets. Further, we posit that risk-based capital requirements may be socially desirable. THE Term “collateralized Loan Obligations” (CLOs) was coined in 1989, when corporate loans were first used as collateral in Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs).1 Since then, the growth in loan sales has been enormous. According to Lucas et al. (2006), $1.1 trillion of CDOs were outstanding as of 2005, and 50% of their collateral was comprised of loans. In addition to pooled securities, banks also trade first loss positions on single names through direct sales of individual loans. In the United States, loan sales have grown from $8 billion in 1991 to $154.8 billion by 2004. 2 If a bank securitizes or sells a loan that it originated, it is buying insurance on credit events over which it has either more control or more information than the buyer. In the face of this informational friction, why did the secondary market for corporate loans develop",

    "abstract": "We study secured lending contracts using a proprietary , loan-level database of bilat- eral repurchase agreements containing groups of simultaneous loans backed by mul- tiple tranches within a securitization. We show that lower-quality loans (i.e., loans backed by lower-rated collateral) have higher margins and spreads. We calibrate a model using collateral asset prices and ﬁnd that lower-quality loans are riskier de- spite the higher margins, yet cheaper for the borrower. This ﬁnding is consistent with a combination of lender optimism and reaching for yield. We also show that lower- quality loans have longer maturity , consistent with models of rollover concerns with asymmetric information. Loans Secured BY Collateral Contribute to the ﬁnancing of critical as- sets such as real estate and the balance sheets of ﬁnancial intermediaries. The 2007 ﬁnancial crisis put a spotlight on nonprice loan terms such as collateral requirements and maturity , as lenders’ active adjustment of these terms to re- duce their credit exposure contributed to the fragility of our ﬁnancial system. Recent literature has proposed dynamic models of lending in which borrowers hold illiquid assets and face rollover risk. In these models, lender and bor- rower beliefs can differ, and lenders’ actions reinforce one another, leading to runs and maturity “rat races.”1 However, despite these theoretical advances, the question of how fragility arises from lenders’ use of nonprice terms remains Boston.

    "abstract": "I exploit the exogenous component of a formula-based allocation of government funds across banks in Argentina to test for financial constraints and underinvestment by local banks. Banks are found to expand lending by $0.66 in response to an additional dollar of external financing. Using novel data to measure risk and return on marginal lending, I show that the profitability of lending does not decline and total borrower debt increases during lending expansions, holding investment opportunities constant. Overall, financial shocks to constrained banks are found to have a quick, persistent, and amplified effect on the aggregate supply of credit. THE Question OF HOW Financing Frictions in the banking sector affect lending behavior and economic activity has long been of concern to the literature on financial institutions. Recent empirical work on the lending channel and credit crunches has focused on two issues: whether financing frictions exist and, if so, whether shocks to the financial position of a bank have any real effect on in- vestment. 1 The question of whether constrained financial intermediaries lead to underinvestment, however, has received little attention. This is fundamen- tally an empirical question since, as Allen and Gale (2004) point out, the effect of contracting imperfections in financial intermediation on the efficiency of in- vestment is theoretically ambiguous.

    "abstract": "In China, between 2006 and 2013, local public debt crowded out the investment of private ﬁrms by tightening their funding constraints while leaving state-owned ﬁrms’ investment unaffected. We establish this result using a purpose-built data set for Chinese local public debt. Private ﬁrms invest less in cities with more public debt, with the reduction in investment larger for ﬁrms located farther from banks in other cities or more dependent on external funding. Moreover, in cities where public debt is high, private ﬁrms’ investment is more sensitive to internal cash ﬂow . IN China , Local Government Debt almost quadrupled from 5.8% to 22% of GDP over the 2006 to 2013 period. This increase in local public debt was due billion, together with much-reduced reliance on central government debt and transfers to local governments. Based on a novel, purpose-built database on the public debt of prefecture-level Chinese cities from 2006 to 2013, we show that the increase in local public debt crowded out private investment in the versity of Naples Federico II, Csef , Eief , Cepr, and Ecgi.

    "abstract": "We introduce a new measure of emerging market sovereign credit risk: the local cur- rency credit spread, deﬁned as the spread of local currency bonds over the synthetic local currency risk-free rate constructed using cross-currency swaps. We ﬁnd that lo- cal currency credit spreads are positive and sizable. Compared with credit spreads on foreign-currency-denominated debt, local currency credit spreads have lower means, lower cross-country correlations, and lower sensitivity to global risk factors. We dis- cuss several major sources of credit spread differentials, including positively corre- lated credit and currency risk, selective default, capital controls, and various ﬁnancial market frictions. When A Sovereign borrows in its own currency, the spread it pays over the U.S. Treasury risk-free benchmark might contain two major types of risk: cur- rency risk and credit risk. We introduce a new sovereign risk measure, the local currency (LC) credit spread , to measure the credit risk component of LC- denominated debt. We ﬁnd that the LC credit spread is positive and sizable for emerging market sovereigns, despite their ability to print their own currency to repay the debt. Furthermore, we document signiﬁcant differences between the LC credit spread and the conventional measure of emerging market sovereign Greenwood, Kenneth Rogoff, and Luis Viceira for their invaluable advice and guidance.

    "title": "Local Dividend Clienteles",
    "abstract": "We exploit demographic variation to identify the effect of dividend demand on corpo- rate payout policy. Retail investors tend to hold local stocks and older investors prefer dividend-paying stocks. Together, these tendencies generate geographically varying demand for dividends. Firms headquartered in areas in which seniors constitute a large fraction of the population are more likely to pay dividends, initiate dividends, and have higher dividend yields. We also provide indirect evidence as to why man- agers may respond to the demand for dividends from local seniors. Overall, these results are consistent with the notion that the investor base affects corporate policy choices. This Paper Examines THE Role of investor demand in shaping corporate payout policy. Miller and Modigliani (1961) suggest that matching takes place between investor clienteles who demand dividends and those ﬁrms that ﬁnd it less costly to pay them, that is, companies set payout policy and investors sort based on their preferences for dividends. On the other hand, ﬁrms may actively respond to the preferences of their current shareholders. The empirical patterns will be the same regardless of the direction of the underlying causal relation (payout policies match investor preferences), but the implications for understanding corporate policy are very different. For example, if companies adjust policy in response to the composition of their current investors, then it clearly matters who the shareholders actual",

    "title": "Local Risk, Local Factors, and Asset Prices",
    "abstract": "Firm location affects ﬁrm risk through local factor prices. We ﬁnd more procycli- cal factor prices such as wages and real estate prices in areas with more cyclical economies, namely, high “local beta” areas. While procyclical wages provide a natural hedge against aggregate shocks and reduce ﬁrm risk, procyclical prices of real estate, which are part of ﬁrm assets, increase ﬁrm risk. We conﬁrm that ﬁrms located in higher local beta areas have lower industry-adjusted returns and conditional betas, and show that the effect is stronger among ﬁrms with low real estate holdings. A production-based equilibrium model explains these empirical ﬁndings. Most Work IN THE FINANCEliterature treats labor and capital markets as per- fectly competitive and homogeneous at the aggregate level, where wages and rental rates equalize across locations. In reality, workers face frictions when moving from place to place (e.g., transaction costs in housing, job search fric- tions, family coordination issues, etc.). Moreover, a signiﬁcant part of physical capital, such as land and structures, is immobile. Production factors that are subject to such geographical immobility, namely, local factors, account for a large part of economic output.1 Fluctuations in factor prices due to local eco- nomic conditions can thus have important effects on the ﬁrms using them. In this paper, we show that local factor prices respond to aggregate shocks differently across localities based on the types of industries that",

    "title": "Long-Run Performance following Private",
    "abstract": "Public firms that place equity privately experience positive announcements effects, with negative post-announcement stock-price performance. This finding is incon- sistent with the underreaction hypothesis. Instead, it suggests that investors are overoptimistic about the prospects of firms issuing equity, regardless of the method of issuance. Further, in contrast to public offerings, private issues follow periods of relatively poor operating performance. Thus, investor overoptimism at the time of private issues is not due to the behavioral tendency to overweight recent experi- ence at the expense of long-term averages. IT IS Well Established that the stock market reacts negatively to announce- ments of seasoned equity issues.1 Recently, Spiess and Affleck-Graves (1995) and Loughran and Ritter (1997) document that, in addition to the negative announcement period returns, issuing firms experience abnormally low stock returns over the five years following the issue announcement. One explana- tion of these findings is that managers time equity issues to take advantage of \"windows of opportunity\" to issue overvalued equity. This explanation requires not only that investors are overly optimistic about the issuing firms' prospects at the time of the issue announcement, but also that investors underreact to information conveyed by the announcement. While Fama (1998) argues that the results reflect normal random variations that occur in effi- cient markets, the long-run post-announcem",

    "abstract": "This paper documents the existence of a persistent component in consumption growth. We take a novel approach using news coverage to capture investor concern about economic growth prospects. We provide evidence that consumption growth is highly predictable over long horizons—our measure explains between 23% and 38% of cumulative future consumption growth at the ﬁve-year horizon and beyond. Fur- thermore, we show a strong connection between this predictability and asset prices. Innovations to our measure price 51 standard portfolios in the cross section and our one-factor model outperforms many benchmark macro- and return-based multifac- tor models. THE Difficulties THE Canonical Consumption -based asset pricing model faces in matching key empirical moments in both the time series (Campbell and Shiller ( 1988), Fama and French ( 1988)) and the cross section (Hansen and Singleton ( 1982, 1983)) have sparked a large theoretical literature. 1 While many models have been developed to account for these empirical regularities, a common critique of these models is that their assumptions are difﬁcult to verify in the data. Moreover, by construction, many of their predictions are similar, making them hard to distinguish empirically. One of the leading channels is based on the assumption of a persistent component in consumption growth, known as “long-run risk.” If such a component exists, small shocks to this component can be ampliﬁed through certain preferences, such as Epstein and Dame",

    "abstract": "Long-term reversals in U.S. Stock returns are better explained as the rational reactions of investors to locked-in capital gains than an irrational overreaction to news. Predic- tors of returns based on the overreaction hypothesis have no power, while those that measure locked-in capital gains do, completely subsuming past returns measures that are traditionally used to predict long-term returns. In data from Hong Kong, where investment income is not taxed, reversals are nonexistent, and returns are not fore- castable either by traditional measures or by measures based on the capital gains lock-in hypothesis that successfully predict U.S. Returns. Jegadeesh AND Titman (1993) show that winner stocks over the past 6 months outperform losers by 1% per month during the next 6 to 12 months. DeBondt and Thaler (1985) show that loser stocks in the past 3 to 5 years outperform winners by 25% over the next 3 years. These findings of short-term momentum and long- term reversals are the empirical cornerstones of the study of behavioral finance. Prominent theoretical models in this area such as those of Barberis, Shleifer, and Vishny (1998), Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam (1998), and Hong and Stein (1999) all treat short-term momentum and long-term reversals as inseparable phenomena.

Between 1927 and 1996, neither method applied to splits 25 percent or larger finds performance significantly different from zero. Over selected subperiods, subsamples of 2-1 splits restricted by book-to- market availability requirements display positive abnormal returns using some methods. However, these samples show small or negligible abnormal re- turns using the calendar-time method. Overall, the stock split evidence against market efficiency is neither pervasive nor compelling. THE Efficient-market Conception of near-perfect capital markets that render only fleeting and nonsystematic gain and loss opportunities to investors has been cri- ticized in recent years by the behavioral finance literature, which offers evidence that stock transactions are often executed (in relation to known events such as stock issues, stock splits, and repurchases) at price levels that imply predictably high or low risk-adjusted returns.

    "abstract": "We analyze brokerage data and an experiment to test a cognitive dissonance based theory of trading: investors avoid realizing losses because they dislike admitting that past purchases were mistakes, but delegation reverses this effect by allowing the in- vestor to blame the manager instead. Using individual trading data, we show that the disposition effect—the propensity to realize past gains more than past losses—applies only to nondelegated assets like individual stocks; delegated assets, like mutual funds, exhibit a robust reverse-disposition effect. In an experiment, we show that increasing investors’ cognitive dissonance results in both a larger disposition effect in stocks and a larger reverse-disposition effect in funds. Additionally, increasing the salience of delegation increases the reverse-disposition effect in funds. Cognitive dissonance provides a uniﬁed explanation for apparently contradictory investor behavior across asset classes and has implications for personal investment decisions, mutual fund management, and intermediation. IN Recent Years , Economists have come to appreciate the importance of house- hold investment decisions for understanding both decision-making under risk and the behavior of investors in ﬁnancial markets (e.g., Campbell ( 2006)).

    "abstract": "This paper shows that low-risk anomalies in the capital asset pricing model and in traditional factor models arise when investors require compensation for coskew- ness risk. Empirically, we ﬁnd that option-implied ex ante skewness is strongly related to ex post residual coskewness, which allows us to construct coskewness factor-mimicking portfolios. Controlling for skewness renders the alphas of betting- against-beta and betting-against-volatility insigniﬁcant. We also show that the re- turns of beta- and volatility-sorted portfolios are driven largely by a single principal component, which in turn is explained largely by skewness. ∗Paul Schneider is at USI Lugano and SFI.

    "abstract": "We calibrate the standard principal–agent model with constant relative risk aversion and lognormal stock prices to a sample of 598 U.S. CEOs. We show that this model pre- dicts that most CEOs should not hold any stock options. Instead, CEOs should have lower base salaries and receive additional shares in their companies; many would be required to purchase additional stock in their companies. These contracts would re- duce average compensation costs by 20% while providing the same incentives and the same utility to CEOs. We conclude that the standard principal–agent model typically used in the literature cannot rationalize observed contracts. We don’t give options because it would be a lottery ticket.

    "abstract": "The aggregate portfolio of actively managed U.S. Equity mutual funds is close to the market portfolio, but the high costs of active management show up intact as lower returns to investors. Bootstrap simulations suggest that few funds produce benchmark-adjusted expected returns sufﬁcient to cover their costs. If we add back the costs in fund expense ratios, there is evidence of inferior and superior performance (nonzero trueα) in the extreme tails of the cross-section of mutual fundα estimates. There IS A Constraint on the returns to active investing that we call equi- librium accounting. In short (details later), suppose that when returns are measured before costs (fees and other expenses), passive investors get passive returns, that is, they have zeroα (abnormal expected return) relative to passive benchmarks. This means active investment must also be a zero sum game— aggregate α is zero before costs. Thus, if some active investors have positive α before costs, it is dollar for dollar at the expense of other active investors. After costs, that is, in terms of net returns to investors, active investment must be a negative sum game. (Sharpe (1991) calls this the arithmetic of active management.) We examine mutual fund performance from the perspective of equilibrium accounting. For example, at the aggregate level, if the value-weight (VW) port- folio of active funds has a positiveα before costs, we can infer that the VW portfolio of active investments outside mutual funds has a",

    "title": "Lucky CEOs and Lucky Directors",
    "abstract": "We study the relation between opportunistic timing of option grants and corporate governance failures, focusing on “lucky” grants awarded at the lowest price of the grant month. Option grant practices were designed to provide lucky grants not only to executives but also to independent directors. Lucky grants to both CEOs and directors were the product of deliberate choices, not of ﬁrms’ routines, and were timed to make them more proﬁtable. Lucky grants are associated with higher CEO compensation from other sources, no majority of independent directors, no outside blockholder on the compensation committee, and a long-serving CEO. THE Opportunistic Timing of executives’ option grants—via backdating, “spring-loading” based on the use of inside information, or otherwise—has attracted a great deal of attention. The SEC and a small army of private law ﬁrms hired by companies have investigated past grant practices. More than 200 companies have come under scrutiny, and dozens of executives and directors have been forced to resign. Work in ﬁnancial economics has contributed substantially to identifying the existence of opportunistic timing. The literature on the timing of option grants begins with the seminal work by Yermack (1997), who shows that stock prices exhibited negative abnormal returns prior to a grant date and positive abnor- mal returns afterward. Aboody and Kasznik (2000) and Chauvin and Shenoy (2001) suggest that these return patterns were partly due to the manipulation",

    "title": "Luxury Goods and the Equity Premium",
    "abstract": "This paper evaluates the equity premium using novel data on the consumption of luxury goods. Specifying utility as a nonhomothetic function of both luxury and basic consumption goods, we derive pricing equations and evaluate the risk of holding eq- uity. Household survey and national accounts data mostly reflect basic consumption, and therefore overstate the risk aversion necessary to match the observed equity pre- mium. The risk aversion implied by the consumption of luxury goods is more than an order of magnitude less than that implied by national accounts data. For the very rich, the equity premium is much less of a puzzle. Prescott (1985), and the extensive literature that follows, the risk of the stock market as measured by its co-movement with aggregate consumption is in- sufficient to justify the extent to which its average return exceeds the return on short-term government debt. We propose a partial resolution to this equity premium puzzle by distinguishing between the consumption of basic goods and that of luxury goods. Intuitively, rich households that hold most equity are al- most satiated in their consumption of basic goods; wealth shocks are reflected in the consumption of luxury goods, which is much more responsive to stock returns than the consumption of basic goods. Specifically, we model utility as a function of the consumption of both a ba- sic good, of which a certain amount is required in every period, and a luxury good, which has low marginal utility even",

    "title": "Lying to Speak the Truth: Selective Manipulation",
    "abstract": "We analyze a principal-agent model in which an effort-averse agent can manipulate a publicly observable performance report. The principal cannot observe the agent’s cost of effort, her effort choice, and whether she manipulated the report. An optimal contract links compensation to the realized output and the (possibly manipulated) report. Manipulation can be beneﬁcial to the principal because it can make the re- port more informative about the agent’s effort choice, thereby reducing the agent’s information rent. This is achieved through a contract that incentivizes the agent to selectively engage in manipulation based on her effort choice. Financial Reporting Allows Investors TO monitor the performance of ﬁrms in which they invest. However, ﬁnancial reporting is noisy, which adds frictions to the design of incentive compensation and may lead to subopti- mal decisions. Some have argued that investors may beneﬁt from allowing executives discretion in “managing” ﬁnancial reports, if this would reduce the noise in their reporting (e.g., Subramanyam ( 1996)).

    "title": "Macroeconomic Conditions and the Puzzles",
    "abstract": "I build a dynamic capital structure model that demonstrates how business cycle vari- ation in expected growth rates, economic uncertainty, and risk premia inﬂuences ﬁrms’ ﬁnancing policies. Countercyclical ﬂuctuations in risk prices, default probabili- ties, and default losses arise endogenously through ﬁrms’ responses to macroeconomic conditions. These comovements generate large credit risk premia for investment grade ﬁrms, which helps address the credit spread puzzle and the under-leverage puzzle in a uniﬁed framework. The model generates interesting dynamics for ﬁnancing and de- faults, including market timing in debt issuance and credit contagion. It also provides a novel procedure to estimate state-dependent default losses. Risks Associated With macroeconomic conditions are crucial for asset valu- ation. Naturally, they should also have important implications for corporate decisions. By introducing macroeconomic conditions into ﬁrms’ ﬁnancing de- cisions, this paper provides a risk-based explanation for two puzzles related to corporate debt. The ﬁrst puzzle is the credit spread puzzle, where yield spreads between investment grade corporate bonds and Treasuries are high and volatile relative to the observed default rates and recovery rates. The sec- ond puzzle is the under-leverage puzzle, where ﬁrms choose low leverage ratios despite facing seemingly large tax beneﬁts of debt and small costs of ﬁnancial distress.

    "abstract": "Revisions in successive Greenbook forecasts of quarterly real GDP growth proxy for news of current and expected future economic growth. In the sample 1975 through 2015, news of future growth is slightly negatively related to contempora- neous changes in Treasury bond yields, while news of current growth is strongly pos- itively related to changes in these yields. Both results are difﬁcult to reconcile with a representative agent’s bondholding ﬁrst-order condition.

Growth and a stochastic discount factor (SDF). Models typically characterize time-varying conditional expectations of both economic growth and the SDF . Since real yields are inverses of conditional expectations of the SDF , these models often have rich implications for the comovement of news about eco- nomic growth—both current and expected future growth—with innovations in real yields. I estimate relations between growth news at various forecast horizons and contemporaneous innovations in real yields, putting no economic restric- tions on the possible patterns.

    "title": "Making Sense of Cents: An Examination of Firms",
    "abstract": "This paper examines the performance consequences of cutting discretionary expen- ditures and managing accruals to exceed analyst forecasts. We show that firms that just beat analyst forecasts with low quality earnings exhibit a short-term stock price benefit relative to firms that miss forecasts with high quality earnings. This trend, however, reverses over a 3-year horizon. Additionally, firms reducing discretionary expenditures to beat forecasts have significantly greater equity issuances and insider selling in the following year, consistent with managers understanding the myopic na- ture of their actions. Our results confirm survey evidence suggesting managers engage in myopic behavior to beat benchmarks. There IS Growing Evidence that managers are willing to sacrifice economic value to meet short-run earnings objectives. For example, Graham, Harvey, and Rajagopal (2005) report that a majority of managers would forgo a project with positive net present value (NPV) if the project would cause them to fall short of the current quarter consensus forecast. When asked what actions they might take in order to meet an earnings target, approximately 80% suggest they would decrease discretionary spending, including R&D and advertising expense. This earnings management (e.g., Baber, Fairfield, and Haggard (1991), Bhojraj and Libby (2005), Roychowdhury (2006)).

    "abstract": "This paper shows that the existence of managerial ability, combined with the la- bor contract prevalent in the industry, implies that the closed-end fund discount should exhibit many of the primary features documented in the literature. We eval- uate the model’s ability to match the quantitative features of the data, and find that it does well, although there is some observed behavior that remains to be explained. THE Role OF Delegated Portfolio Managers in financial markets has puzzled financial economists for some time. Their high level of remuneration suggests that they add considerable value. Yet, while their important role as providers of diversification services is widely recognized, economists have had difficulty finding evidence of any additional value that might justify their compensation levels. It is certainly not hard to find examples of funds that seem to add no value. For example, the Homestead Nasdaq 100 Index Tracking Stock Fund (ticker: Hnasx) is an open-end fund that charges investors 1.5% per year to track the Nasdaq 100 index. As of September 30, 2004, 99.42% of the fund was invested in a single security, the Nasdaq 100 exchange-traded fund (qqqq). The remaining 0.58% was in cash. Investors in the fund therefore pay 1.5% per annum to invest in a single security they could buy themselves for no annual charge. This lack of evidence of ability raises serious questions about why investors entrust their savings to active managers at all, and nowhere is this puz",

    "abstract": "Capital budgeting in multidivisional firms depends on the external assess- ment of the whole firm, as well as on headquarters'assessment of the divisions. While corporate headquarters may create value by directly monitoring divi- sions, the external assessment of the firm is a public good for division man- agers who, consequently, are tempted to free ride. As the number of divisions increases, the free-rider problem is aggravated, and internal capital markets substitute for external capital markets in the provision of managerial incen- tives. The analysis relates the value of diversification to characteristics of the firm, the industry, and the capital market. Recent Literature Suggests that corporate diversification is out of style. However, the fact remains that many corporations are remarkably diversified: In 1992, 87 percent of the 500 largest U.S. Public companies operated in more than one SIC code (Montgomery (1994)). Since most large firms are multidivisional, their inter- nal capital markets play an important role in the investment decisions of the economy. I study the process by which internal capital markets channel funds within corporations, focusing on the following effects. Corporate headquarters can create value in a multidivisional firm by monitoring division managers and efficiently allocating funds across divisions. On the other hand, each division manager in a multidivisional firm takes the external perception of the whole firm as a public good, and is tempt",

    "abstract": "We present a rational expectations model of optimal executive compensation in a setting where managers are in a position to manipulate short-term stock prices and the manipulation propensity is uncertain. We analyze the tradeoffs involved in con- ditioning pay on long- versus short-term performance and show how manipulation, and investors’ uncertainty about it, affects the equilibrium pay contract and the in- formativeness of prices. Firm and manager characteristics determine the optimal compensation scheme: the strength of incentives, the pay horizon, and the use of options. We consider how corporate governance and disclosure regulations can help create an environment that enables better contracting. IS Improperly Structured Incentive compensation a key factor underlying the recent ﬁnancial crisis and the recurrent corporate fraud scandals of the past decade? A recent survey reports that 98% of responding banks “believe the compensation structures were a factor underlying the crisis.” 1 Policy makers are similarly concerned about the impact of short-term pay, especially in the ﬁnancial sector.

    "abstract": "This paper argues that the legacy potential of a ﬁrm’s strategy is an important deter- minant of CEO compensation, turnover, and strategy change. A legacy makes CEO replacement expensive, because ﬁrm performance can only partially be attributed to a newly employed manager. Boards may therefore optimally allow an incumbent to be entrenched. Moreover, when a ﬁrm changes strategy it is optimal to change the CEO, because the incumbent has a vested interest in seeing the new strategy fail. Even though CEOs have no speciﬁc skills in our model, legacy issues can explain the empirical association between CEO and strategy change. This Paper Proposes A model of CEO replacement and puts forward a novel determinant for turnover decisions: the legacy potential of a ﬁrm’s strategy. We mean by this the extent to which a manager’s decisions affect future ﬁrm cash ﬂows, potentially beyond the manager’s own tenure. The replacement of a CEO is arguably one of the most important decisions a ﬁrm takes. Yet, the theoretical and empirical ﬁnance literature has relatively little to say about the ﬁrm and manager-speciﬁc characteristics that lead to one manager being ﬁred and replaced by another. As Brickley (2003) points out, the only variable that predicts turnover empirically is poor ﬁrm performance, but it has little pre- dictive power. Theoretical papers on managerial turnover tend to reduce CEO successions to a sequence of static interactions (see below for more details). As such they do not dis",

    "abstract": "Using a large sample of litigation events involving publicly listed defendants, we document a surprising fact. The resolution of litigation through a court’s decision dominates settlement of litigation from the shareholders’ point of view, even when the firm loses. We develop a model using agency costs within the firm to explain why the market views settlement as a negative outcome on average and find empirical evi- dence supporting the implications of the model. Specifically, firms with weak corporate governance settle litigation more quickly, and the market reacts more negatively to settlements involving firms with higher agency costs. Politically, There ARE FEW Issues that are more contentiously debated than tort reform in the United States. The argument is usually framed from the per- spective of various opposing stakeholders in the process; proponents of reform contend that the system is too often used frivolously to extort wealth from busi- ness, while opponents of reform point out that it is the best means of protecting other stakeholders (customers, employees, neighboring communities, etc.) from damages inflicted by the operations of business. Certainly, there is ample evi- dence to prove that both statements are true at the margins. But often left out of the policy debates is the forgotten stakeholder in corporate litigation: the shareholders who must ultimately bear the cost of the litigation.

    "abstract": "We analyze a sample of 72 IPO firms that went public between 1992 and 1996 for which we have detailed proprietary information about the amount and cost of D&O liability insurance. If managers of IPO firms are exploiting superior inside infor- mation, we hypothesize that the amount of insurance coverage chosen will be re- lated to the post-offering performance of the issuing firm's shares. Consistent with the hypothesis, we find a significant negative relation between the three-year post- IPO stock price performance and the insurance coverage purchased in conjunction with the IPO. One plausible interpretation is that, like insider securities transac- tions, D&O insurance decisions reveal opportunistic behavior by managers. This provides some motivation to argue that disclosure of the details of D&O insurance decisions, as is required in some other countries, is valuable. Corporate Insiders ARE Widely Acknowledged to possess superior information about future prospects for the firms they manage, and to some degree to utilize that information to their private benefit. One well-known example that helps to establish this inference is that insider trades have been shown to contain information that helps to predict security returns. We refer to insiders' use of corporate information for private benefit as managerial op- portunism.

    "abstract": "This study documents that managerial stock ownership plays an important role in de- termining corporate debt maturity. Controlling for previously identified determinants of debt maturity and modeling leverage and debt maturity as jointly endogenous, we document a significant and robust inverse relation between managerial stock own- ership and corporate debt maturity. We also show that managerial stock ownership influences the relation between credit quality and debt maturity and between growth opportunities and debt maturity. THE Importance OF Leverage AND Debt Maturity Structure Choice in alleviat- ing manager–shareholder agency conflicts is well recognized in the finance literature. These vital decisions are at the discretion of top managers who are expected to make optimal (value-maximizing) financing choices on behalf of the shareholders. However, given the separation of ownership and control, managers cannot be expected to voluntarily choose the optimal debt maturity structure or leverage and self-impose monitoring unless there is an incentive mechanism to align managerial and shareholder interests. It is clear, therefore, that these decisions themselves are subject to an agency problem of managerial discretion. Managerial stock ownership can be effective in aligning the interests of man- agers and shareholders to mitigate such agency problems (see, e.g., Jensen and Meckling (1976)).

    "abstract": "How do shareholders perceive managers who lever up under a takeover threat? Increasing leverage conveys good news if it reflects management's ability to en- hance value. It conveys bad news, though, if inefficient managers are more pres- sured to lever up than the efficient ones. This paper demonstrates that negative updating may prevail. Managers who lever up to end a takeover threat may thus commit to enhance value and yet increase their chances of being replaced by their shareholders. The model provides implications for the dispersion of intraindustry leverage and for the stock price reaction to debt-for-equity exchanges. Strong link between corporate leverage and activity in the market for cor- porate control. Garvey and Hanka (1999), for example, show that smaller takeover costs lead to higher leverage, while Berger, Ofek, and Yermack (1997) show that the leverage of target firms increases in the aftermath of unsuc- cessful tender offers. One interpretation of these findings is that, in re- sponse to a takeover threat, managers lever up to commit to an increase in firm value that preempts takeover gains (see Grossman and Hart (1982), Jensen (1986), and Zwiebel (1996)). Consistent with this interpretation, Safied- dine and Titman (1999) report an increase in operating performance for tar- get firms that lever up the most in response to an unsuccessful takeover attempt. Committing to increase value does not seem to secure the jobs of target managers, though. In Safieddine",

    "title": "Managers, Workers, and Corporate Control",
    "abstract": "If management has high private benefits and a small equity stake, managers and workers are natural allies against takeover threats. Two forces are at play. First, managers can transform employees into a “shark repellent” through long-term labor contracts and thereby reduce the firm’s attractiveness to raiders. Second, employees can act as “white squires” for the incumbent managers. To protect their high wages, they resist hostile takeovers by refusing to sell their shares to the raider or by lobbying against the takeover. The model predicts that wages are inversely correlated with the managerial equity stake, and decline after takeovers. Labor Economists View Industrial Relations as being shaped by the conflict between workers and management. Financial economists view corporate gov- ernance as the outcome of the diverging interests of shareholders and manage- ment. Actually, these two conflicts are present simultaneously and interact. We show that the conflict in corporate governance, when particularly acute, can soften the clash in industrial relations. Managers who place a great value on control and own only a small equity stake have an incentive to pay high wages and not to monitor workers too strictly. Noncontrolling shareholders are those who bear most of the costs of such an employment policy. Eree who helped us to improve the paper considerably.

    "abstract": "Mandatory disclosure is a regulatory tool intended to allow market participants to assess operational risk. We examine the value of disclosure through the controversial SEC requirement, since overturned, which required major hedge funds to register as investment advisors and file Form ADV disclosures. Leverage and ownership struc- tures suggest that lenders and equity investors were already aware of operational risk. However, operational risk does not mediate flow-performance relationships. In- vestors either lack this information or regard it as immaterial. These findings suggest that regulators should account for the endogenous production of information and the marginal benefit of disclosure to different investment clienteles. Mandatory Disclosure is an important regulatory tool intended to allow mar- ket participants to assess manager risks without unnecessarily constraining manager actions. This trade-off between transparency and freedom of activity is particularly relevant for hedge funds, which often rely on proprietary mod- els and positions. 1 In the ongoing dialogue over the pros and cons of hedge fund activity, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in partic- ular has tried to walk a fine line between allowing the invisible hand of the market to establish the level and type of disclosure demanded of investment of Business; William Goetzmann is the Edwin J.

    "abstract": "Between 1934 and 1974, the Federal Reserve changed the initial margin requirement for the U.S. Stock market 22 times. I use this variation to show that investors’ leverage constraints affect the pricing of risk. Consistent with earlier theoretical predictions, I ﬁnd that tighter leverage constraints result in a ﬂatter relation between betas and expected returns. My results provide strong empirical support for the idea that the constraints investors face may help explain the empirical failure of the capital asset pricing model. ONE OF THE First AND Most persistent anomalous ﬁndings in ﬁnance is that the return difference between high-beta and low-beta stocks is signiﬁcantly smaller than predicted by the capital asset pricing model (capm) of Sharpe (1964), Lintner ( 1965), and Mossin ( 1966). An early explanation for the em- pirical ﬂatness of the security market line, originally documented by Black, Jensen, and Scholes ( 1972), is given by Black ( 1972), who shows that investors’ inability to borrow at the risk-free rate results in a lower cross-sectional price of risk than in the unconstrained Capm. Black’s version of the Capm is un- realistic, however, as in the real world investors are able to borrow, just not in inﬁnite amounts as assumed in the Capm. This idea is further developed by Frazzini and Pedersen ( 2014), who present a model in which investors face a limit on their leverage. In their model, the slope of the security market line, that is, the return difference bet",

    "title": "Market Expectations in the Cross-Section",
    "abstract": "Returns and cash ﬂow growth for the aggregate U.S. Stock market are highly and robustly predictable. Using a single factor extracted from the cross-section of book-to- market ratios, we ﬁnd anout-of-sample return forecasting R2 of 13% at the annual frequency (0.9% monthly). We document similar out-of-sample predictability for re- turns on value, size, momentum, and industry portfolios. We present a model linking aggregate market expectations to disaggregated valuation ratios in a latent factor system. Spreads in value portfolios’ exposures to economic shocks are key to iden- tifying predictability and are consistent with duration-based theories of the value premium. THE Most Common APPROACHto measuring aggregate return and cash ﬂow ex- pectations is predictive regression. As suggested by the present value relation- the aggregate price-dividend ratio is among the most informative predictive variables. Typical in-sample estimates ﬁnd that about 10% of annual return variation can be accounted for by forecasts based on the aggregate book-to- market ratio, but ﬁnd little or no out-of-sample predictive power.1 In this paper we show that reliance on aggregate quantities drastically understates the de- gree of value ratios’ predictive content for both returns and cash ﬂow growth, and hence understates the volatility of investor expectations. Our estimates suggest that as much as 13% of the out-of-sample variation in annual market returns (as much as 12% for dividend growth), and some",

    "abstract": "This paper develops a structural model that determines default spreads in a set- ting where the debt’s collateral is endogenously determined by the borrower’s invest- ment choice, and a demand variable with permanent and temporary components. We also consider the possibility that the borrower cannot commit to taking the value- maximizing investment choice, and may, in addition, be constrained in its ability to raise external capital. Based on a model calibrated to data on office buildings and commercial mortgages, we present numerical simulations that quantify the extent to which investment flexibility, incentive problems, and credit constraints affect default spreads. Starting With THE Seminal Work of Black and Scholes (1973) and Merton (1974), researchers have developed contingent claims models to value risky debt. A subset of these models, known as structural models, assumes that markets are perfect and that the value of the collateral of the debt can be viewed as ex- ogenous. 1 This approach to pricing debt is in sharp contrast to the theoretical 2000 FMA meeting in Seattle, the 10th Annual Derivatives Securities Conference, the 2000 Efma meeting in Athens, the 2001 Real Estate Conference in Vail, the 2001 WFA conference in Tucson, the 2002 Reri conference, the 2002 Real Options conference, Viral Acharya, Andres Almazan, Robert Goldstein, Robert Parrino, Chester Spatt, Suresh Sundaresan, Nancy Wallace, Joe Williams, and an anonymous referee for helpful comments and discus",

    "abstract": "Previous studies of liquidity span short time periods and focus on the individual security. In contrast, we study aggregate market spreads, depths, and trading ac- tivity for U.S. Equities over an extended time sample. Daily changes in market averages of liquidity and trading activity are highly volatile and negatively serially dependent. Liquidity plummets significantly in down markets. Recent market vol- atility induces a decrease in trading activity and spreads. There are strong day- of-the-week effects; Fridays accompany a significant decrease in trading activity and liquidity, while Tuesdays display the opposite pattern. Long- and short-term interest rates influence liquidity. Depth and trading activity increase just prior to major macroeconomic announcements. Liquidity AND Trading Activity are important features of financial markets, yet little is known about their evolution over time or about their time-series determinants. Their fundamental importance is exemplified by the influ- ence of trading costs on required returns (Amihud and Mendelson (1986), and Jacoby, Fowler, and Gottesman (2000)) which implies a direct link be- tween liquidity and corporate costs of capital. More generally, exchange or- ganization, regulation, and investment management could all be improved by knowledge of factors that influence liquidity and trading activity. A better understanding of these determinants should increase investor confidence in financial markets and thereby enhance the effic",

    "title": "Market Liquidity, Investor Participation,",
    "abstract": "We focus on public-market investor participation to analyze the firm’s decision to stay public or go private. The liquidity of public ownership is both a blessing and a curse: It lowers the cost of capital, but also introduces volatility in a firm’s shareholder base, exposing management to uncertainty regarding shareholder intervention in manage- ment decisions, thereby affecting the manager’s perceived decision-making autonomy and curtailing managerial inputs. We extract predictions about how investor par- ticipation affects stock price level and volatility and the public firm’s incentives to go private, providing a link between investor participation and ﬁrm participation in public markets. “Hotshot executives are fleeing the scrutiny of public companies for the mad money of the private-equity boom,” Business Week, February 27, 2006, p. 52. When Should A Publicly Traded Firm decide to go private? This question, which we address in this paper, is of central importance in the theory of the firm, and has been brought into sharper focus by recent events. During the 1990s, scores of companies went public, many quite young. However, since the precipitous decline of the stock market, the “going-public” wave appears to have been re- placed by a delisting surge. The number of U.S. Companies delisting was 83 in 1999, 86 in 2000, 262 in 2003, and 188 in 2004. 1 Many have conjectured that Kose John, Marco Pagano, Rafael Repullo, Ernst-Ludwig von Thadden, seminar participants at the 200",

We find that market makers are more likely to quote on odd ticks, and to actively narrow the spread, when they can do so anonymously by posting limit orders on Electronic Communication Networks (ECNs). From a public policy perspective, our findings suggest that making the level of pretrade transparency on Nasdaq more opaque by allowing anonymous quotes could improve price competition and narrow spreads further. THE Publicity Surrounding THE Finding of Christie and Schultz (1994) that Nasdaq market makers avoided odd-eighth quotes launched Securities and Exchange tion resulted in Nasdaq agreeing to adopt a series of order handling rule (OHR) changes, which were phased in beginning on January 20, 1997.

    "title": "Market Making Contracts, Firm Value,",
    "abstract": "We examine the effects of secondary market liquidity on ﬁrm value and the IPO deci- sion. Competitive aftermarket liquidity provision is associated with reduced welfare and a discounted secondary market price that can dissuade IPOs. The competitive market fails in particular for ﬁrms or at times when uncertainty regarding fundamen- tal value and asymmetric information are large in combination. In these cases, ﬁrm value and welfare are improved by a contract where the ﬁrm engages a designated market maker to enhance liquidity. Such contracts represent a market solution to a market imperfection, particularly for small, growth ﬁrms. Modern Stock Markets Rely ON Competing limit orders to supply liquidity. In contrast to the designated “specialists” who in past decades coordinated trading on the ﬂagship New York Stock Exchange (nyse), limit order traders are typically not obligated to supply liquidity or otherwise facilitate trading. The desirability of such endogenous liquidity provision has recently been ques- tioned. As Mary L. Shapiro, former chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) noted, “The issue is whether the ﬁrms that effectively act as market makers during normal times should have any obligation to support the market in reasonable ways in tough times.”1 A joint Commodity Futures manuscript were titled “Market Making Obligations and Firm Value.” The authors thank Robert Battalio, Thierry Foucault, David Hirshleifer, Michael Lemmon, Marios Panayides, Ha",

    "title": "Market Reactions to Tangible and Intangible",
    "abstract": "The book-to-market effect is often interpreted as evidence of high expected returns on stocks of “distressed” firms with poor past performance. We dispute this inter- pretation. We find that while a stock’s future return is unrelated to the firm’s past accounting-based performance, it is strongly negatively related to the “intangible” return, the component of its past return that is orthogonal to the firm’s past perfor- mance. Indeed, the book-to-market ratio forecasts returns because it is a good proxy for the intangible return. Also, a composite equity issuance measure, which is related to intangible returns, independently forecasts returns. During THE Past Decade , financial economists have puzzled over two related observations. The first is that over long horizons, future stock returns are neg- atively related to past stock returns. The second is that stock returns are posi- tively related to price-scaled variables such as the book-to-market ratio (BM). Perhaps the most prominent interpretations of these effects are offered by DeBondt and Thaler (1985, 1987), Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny (1994, LSV), and Fama and French (1992, 1993, 1995, and 1997). The DeBondt and Thaler and LSV papers argue that the reversal and book-to-market effects are a result of investor overreaction to past firm performance. Specif- ically, LSV argue that in forecasting future earnings, investors overextrapo- late a firm’s past earnings growth, and as a result stock prices of firms with poor p",

    "abstract": "We present evidence supporting the hypothesis that due to investor specialization and market segmentation, value-relevant information diffuses gradually in ﬁnancial markets. Using the stock market as our setting, we ﬁnd that (i) stocks that are in eco- nomically related supplier and customer industries cross-predict each other’s returns, (ii) the magnitude of return cross-predictability declines with the number of informed investors in the market as proxied by the level of analyst coverage and institutional ownership, and (iii) changes in the stock holdings of institutional investors mirror the model trading behavior of informed investors. Gent assumptions of the efﬁcient markets hypothesis, and posits that gradual diffusion of information among investors explains the observed predictability of returns (Hong and Stein (1999)). To test the gradual diffusion of information hypothesis, the literature has focused mainly on studying the lagged price re- sponse of assets to their own past returns and their interaction with variables thought to affect the speed of information diffusion. This approach has been followed out of necessity because information ﬂow is a complex and unobserv- able process that is difﬁcult to measure directly as separate from an asset’s own past return. In this paper, we explore a new channel of information ﬂow that is sepa- rate from an asset’s own past return, namely, delayed price response to shocks that originate in related ﬁrms in supplier and customer",

    "abstract": "We infer motives for trade initiation from market sidedness. We define trading as more two-sided (one-sided) if the correlation between the number of buyer- and seller- initiated trades increases (decreases), and assess changes in sidedness (relative to a control sample) around events that identify trade initiators. Consistent with asym- metric information, trading is more one-sided before merger news. Consistent with belief heterogeneity, trading is more two-sided before earnings and macro announce- ments with greater dispersion in analyst forecasts, and after news with larger an- nouncement surprises. We examine the codeterminacy of sidedness, bid-ask spread, volatility, number of trades, and order imbalance. A Trade IS Initiated IN A continuous limit order book or quote-driven market whenever a relatively impatient participant submits a market order that meets or crosses a price that has previously been posted by a more patient participant (a limit order trader or dealer). The trade initiator is demanding immediacy and certainty of execution, and is forgoing the possibility of achieving a better price. The literature suggests that the impatience that underlies trade initiation is due to the short-lived nature of any information advantage. A trade initiator may also be experiencing a shock to his or her impatience (e.g., as the end of a trading day approaches), or responding to a temporary decrease in the price of immediacy (as occurs, for instance, when the limit order boo",

    "abstract": "We test overreaction theories of short-run momentum and long-run reversal in the cross section of stock returns. Momentum profits depend on the state of the market, as predicted. From 1929 to 1995, the mean monthly momentum profit following pos- itive market returns is 0.93%, whereas the mean profit following negative market returns is −0.37%. The up-market momentum reverses in the long-run. Our results are robust to the conditioning information in macroeconomic factors. Moreover, we find that macroeconomic factors are unable to explain momentum profits after simple methodological adjustments to take account of microstructure concerns. Several Behavioral Theories have been developed to jointly explain the short- run cross-sectional momentum in stock returns documented by Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) and the long-run cross-sectional reversal in stock returns doc- umented by DeBondt and Thaler (1985). 1 Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrah- manyam (1998; hereafter DHS) and Hong and Stein (1999; hereafter HS) each employ different behavioral or cognitive biases to explain these anomalies. 2,3 of Singapore (Hameed).

    "abstract": "Despite regulatory efforts to promote all-to-all trading, the post–Dodd-Frank index credit default swap market remains two-tiered. Transaction costs are higher for dealer-to-client than interdealer trades, but the difference is explained by the higher, largely permanent, price impact of client trades. Most interdealer trades are liquid- ity motivated and executed via low-cost, low-immediacy trading protocols. Dealer-to- client trades are nonanonymous; they almost always improve upon contemporaneous executable interdealer quotes, and dealers appear to price discriminate based on the perceived price impact of trades. Our results suggest that the market structure is a consequence of the characteristics of client trades: relatively infrequent, large, and differentially informed.

    "title": "Market Structure, Internal Capital Markets,",
    "abstract": "We study how the creation of an internal capital market (ICM) can invite strategic responses in product markets that, in turn, shape firm boundaries. ICMs provide ex post resource flexibility, but come with ex ante commitment costs. Alternatively, stand-alones possess commitment ability but lack flexibility. By creating flexibility, integration can sometimes deter a rival’s entry, but commitment problems can also invite predatory capital raising. These forces drive different organizational equilibria depending on the integrator’s relation to the product market. Hybrid organizational forms like strategic alliances can sometimes dominate integration by offering some of its benefits with fewer strategic costs. This Paper Develops A Theory of the firm in which internal capital markets af- fect the ability to compete in product markets. In our model, a firm’s decision to operate an internal capital market affects the fund-raising behavior of its prod- uct market rivals. An internal capital market can either scare away rival firms or else induce them to compete more aggressively, raising more capital than they otherwise would. In equilibrium, these strategic interactions determine the boundaries of the firm. There is substantial empirical evidence that internal capital markets impact firms’ product market decisions.

    "title": "Market Timing and Capital Structure",
    "abstract": "It is well known that firms are more likely to issue equity when their market values are high, relative to book and past market values, and to repurchase equity when their market values are low. We document that the resulting effects on capital structure are very persistent. As a consequence, current capital structure is strongly related to historical market values. The results suggest the theory that cap- ital structure is the cumulative outcome of past attempts to time the equity market. IN Corporate Finance, \"equity market timing\" refers to the practice of issuing shares at high prices and repurchasing at low prices. The intention is to exploit temporary fluctuations in the cost of equity relative to the cost of other forms of capital. In the efficient and integrated capital markets stud- ied by Modigliani and Miller (1958), the costs of different forms of capital do not vary independently, so there is no gain from opportunistically switching between equity and debt. In capital markets that are inefficient or seg- mented, by contrast, market timing benefits ongoing shareholders at the expense of entering and exiting ones. Managers thus have incentives to time the market if they think it is possible and if they care more about ongoing shareholders. In practice, equity market timing appears to be an important aspect of real corporate financial policy. There is evidence for market timing in four different kinds of studies.

Managers’ perceptions of fundamental value diverge systematically from market val- uations, and perceived mispricing seems an important determinant of managers’ de- cision making. Insider trading patterns shows that low valuation firms are regarded as undervalued by their own managers relative to high valuation firms. This finding is robust to controlling for noninformation motivated trading. Further evidence links managers’ private portfolio decisions to changes in corporate capital structures, sug- gesting that managers try to actively time the market both in their private trades and in firm-level decisions.

    "title": "Market Valuation and Merger Waves",
    "abstract": "Does valuation affect mergers? Data suggest that periods of stock merger activity are correlated with high market valuations. The na ¨ıve explanation that overvalued bidders wish to use stock is incomplete because targets should not be eager to accept stock. However, we show that potential market value deviations from fundamental values on both sides of the transaction can rationally lead to a correlation between stock merger activity and market valuation. Merger waves and waves of cash and stock purchases can be rationally driven by periods of over- and undervaluation of the stock market. Thus, valuation fundamentally impacts mergers. ONE OF THE Puzzles IN Finance is why there are periods when mergers are plen- tiful and other periods when merger activity is much lower. For example, in the period 1963–1964 there were 3,311 total acquisition announcements, while in 1968–1969 there were 10,569 acquisition announcements. Similarly in both the period from 1979 to 1980 and from 1990 to 1991 there were approximately 4,000 acquisition announcements while the late 1980s and late 1990s were much more active, with 9,278 announcements in 1999 alone (see Mergerstat Review 2001). These periods of high activity seem to be correlated with high market valuations, as shown by Maksimovic and Phillips (2001) and Jovanovic and Rousseau (2001). For example, 1998–2000 saw over $1.5 trillion in an- nounced deals per year while 2001, after the market correction, saw half as much. Furthermore, casua",

This feature provides the investor who purchases a security with an option regarding the timing of the realization of capital gains and losses. This option can be used to lower one’s expected tax liability. Even if capital gains tax rates remain constant for different holding periods, an investor who delays the realization of a gain effectively enjoys compound returns on the postponed taxes. If capital losses are tax deductible (or partially tax deductible), tax-timing is even more valu- able, since investors can follow the strategy of selling stocks with capital losses early while postponing the sale of winners. Recent evidence lends support to the contention that some investors respond to this tax-timing option. For ex- ample, Odean (1998) shows that U.S. Investors are more likely to sell losers in December than other months. Similarly, Grinblatt and Kel",

    "abstract": "We present a model of equity trading with informed and uninformed investors where informed investors trade on firm-specific and marketwide private information. The model is used to identify the component of order flow due to marketwide private in- formation. Estimated trades driven by marketwide private information display little or no correlation with the first principal component in order flow. Indeed, we find that co-movement in order flow captures variation mostly in liquidity trades. Marketwide private information obtained from equity market data forecasts industry stock re- turns, and also currency returns. Markets Aggregate Dispersed Information from economic agents and impound it into prices. This information originates from public sources, such as company reports and official statistics, or from the proprietary models, expertise, and insider knowledge of private investors. Its content is either asset-specific or aggregate. By definition, marketwide private information is useful for trading across a variety of assets. In the context of stock trading, marketwide private information can be informative about future firm cash flows that fluctuate with industry or economy-wide business conditions, or about discount rates that move with the economy’s riskless interest rate and aggregate risk premium. In contrast, ﬁrm-speciﬁc private information is idiosyncratic and useless for the valuation of other stocks or assets. While much has been written about firm-specific private i",

This Year Marks the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of Harry Marko- witz's landmark paper, \"Portfolio Selection,\" which appeared in the March 1952 issue of the Journal of Finance. With the hindsight of many years, we can see that this was the moment of the birth of modern financial econom- ics. Although the baby had a healthy delivery, it had to grow into its teenage years before a hint of its full promise became apparent. What has always impressed me most about Markowitz's 1952 paper is that it seemed to come out of nowhere. Compared to the work of his 1990 co-Nobel Prize winners (Sharpe primarily for his paper on the capital asset pricing model and Miller for his paper on capital structure), Markowitz's paper seems to have more of this flavor. In 1676, Sir Isaac Newton wrote his friend Robert Hooke, \"If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoul- ders of giants\" (Newton (1959)) and that is true of Markowitz as well, but, like Newton, he certainly saw a long distance given the height of those shoulders.

    "abstract": "We establish an important role for the ﬁrm by studying capital reallocation decisions of mutual fund ﬁrms. The ﬁrm’s decision to reallocate capital among its mutual fund managers adds at least $474,000 a month, which amounts to over 30% of the total value added of the industry. We provide evidence that this additional value added results from the ﬁrm’s private information about the skill of its managers. The ﬁrm captures this value because investors reward the ﬁrm following a capital reallocation decision by allocating additional capital to the ﬁrm’s funds. WE Demonstrate That AN Important ROLEof a ﬁrm in the mutual fund sector is to efﬁciently match capital to skill. In a world with perfectly rational players, no information asymmetries, and no other frictions, the role of a mutual fund ﬁrm would be irrelevant because investors themselves would efﬁciently allocate their own capital among managers. In reality, mutual fund executives play a very important role in capital allocation. We ﬁnd that a decision to increase a portfolio manager’s assets under management (AUM) leads to an increase in the manager’s productivity as measured by value added. Similarly, a decision to reduce a manager’s responsibilities by taking away assets also leads to an increase in value added. Indeed, at a minimum, the decision to reallocate capital to a manager adds, on average, $474,000 per manager per month, implying that the ﬁrm is responsible for at least 30% of the total value added of the averag",

    "title": "Mean Reversion across National",
    "abstract": "For U.S. Stock prices, evidence of mean reversion over long horizons is mixed, possibly due to lack of a reliable long time series. Using additional cross-sectional power gained from national stock index data of 18 countries during the period 1969 to 1996, we find strong evidence of mean reversion in relative stock index prices. Our findings imply a significantly positive speed of reversion with a half- life of three to three and one-half years. This result is robust to alternative spec- ifications and data. Parametric contrarian investment strategies that fully exploit mean reversion across national indexes outperform buy-and-hold and standard con- trarian strategies. Mean reversion refers to a tendency of asset prices to return to a trend path. The existence of mean reversion in stock prices is subject to much contro- versy. Fama and French (1988a) and Poterba and Summers (1988) are the first to provide direct empirical evidence that mean reversion occurs in U.S. Stock prices over long horizons.1 Others are critical of these results: Lo and MacKinlay (1988) find evidence against mean reversion in U.S. Stock prices using weekly data; Kim, Nelson, and Startz (1991) argue that the mean reversion results are only detectable in prewar data; and Richardson and Stock (1989) and Richardson (1993) report that correcting for small-sample bias problems may reverse the Fama and French (1988a) and Poterba and Summers (1988) results.

    "abstract": "And development spending increases the likelihood of misclassifying solvent firms, number of correctly identified distressed firms, and (3) adjusted measures of distress alleviate previously documented anomalously low returns of large, high distress risk, low book-to-market firms. The results hold after updating stale parameters and under various tax assumptions. Our evidence raises concerns about interpretation of extant literature that relies on accounting measures of distress. THE Bankruptcy Prediction Models proposed by Altman (1968) and Ohlson (1980) are used in many different contexts in both the finance and accounting liter- atures.1 These accounting-based models of distress utilize income statement and balance sheet data, making the models sensitive to accounting report- ing standards. Evidence of increases in R&D spending over the last 20 years suggests that full expensing of R&D expenditures for financial reporting pur- poses severely distorts the earnings and book values of R&D intensive firms (e.g., Chan, Lakonishok, and Sougiannis (2001)). 2 We study the effect of this type of distortion on accounting-based measures of distress risk and show that as reporting of R&D spending has increased over time, the effectiveness of accounting-based indicators of distress has deteriorated to the detriment of inferences related to distress risk.

    "abstract": "We study innovation and product differentiation using a uniqueness measure based on textual analysis of prospectuses. We ﬁnd that small and start-up families have higher start rates than larger families, and their products are more unique. Unique strategies attract more inﬂows in the ﬁrst three years, and investors respond more to text- based uniqueness than other measures such as holdings or returns uniqueness. For established funds, word uniqueness has weak negative power for explaining returns, so investors in competitive equilibrium do not sacriﬁce much performance to get specialized products. Uniqueness attenuates the ﬂow-performance relation, reducing the risk of investor outﬂows. IN This Paper, WE Study Entry, innovation, and product differentiation by U.S. Actively managed equity mutual funds. From 1975 to 2016, the number of mutual funds, excluding money market funds, rose from 530 with $45 billion in assets to 7,736 with $13.4 trillion in assets. The number of fund families (i.e., fund sponsors) increased from 297 to 824 during the same period, and the number of Morningstar style classiﬁcations rose from fewer than 20 to over 100, nearly tripling in the past 20 years.

    "abstract": "Using a large sample of institutional investors’ investments in private equity funds raised between 1991 and 2011, we estimate the extent to which investors’ skill affects their returns. Bootstrap analyses show that the variance of actual performance is higher than would be expected by chance, suggesting that some investors consistently outperform. Extending the Bayesian approach of Korteweg and Sorensen, we estimate that a one-standard-deviation increase in skill leads to an increase in annual returns of between one and two percentage points. These results are stronger in the earlier part of the sample period and for venture funds. Institutional Investors Have Become the most important investors in the U.S. Economy, controlling more than 70% of the publicly traded equity, much of the debt, and virtually all of the private equity. Their investment decisions have far-reaching consequences for their beneﬁciaries. Universities’ spending decisions, pension plans’ ability to fund promised beneﬁts, and foundations’ ability to support charitable endeavors all depend crucially on the returns they receive on their investments. Surprisingly, however, little work has been done to measure differences in investment skill across institutional investors. One place where investment ofﬁcers’ skill is potentially important is in se- lecting private equity funds.

    "abstract": "This paper constructs a liquidity mismatch index (LMI) to gauge the mismatch between the market liquidity of assets and the funding liquidity of liabilities, for 2,882 bank holding companies over 2002 to 2014. The aggregate LMI decreases from +$4 trillion precrisis to −$6 trillion in 2008. We conduct an LMI stress test revealing the fragility of the banking system in early 2007. Moreover, LMI predicts a bank’s stock market crash probability and borrowing decisions from the government dur- ing the ﬁnancial crisis. The LMI is therefore informative about both individual bank liquidity and the liquidity risk of the entire banking system. Liquidity Plays AN Enormous Role in ﬁnancial crises. In the classic model of Diamond and Dybvig ( 1983), the illiquidity of bank assets coupled with the liquidity promised through bank liabilities leaves banks vulnerable to runs and ﬁnancial crises. During the 2007 to 2009 ﬁnancial crisis, the U.S. Gov- ernment provided several trillion dollars of reserves to the ﬁnancial sector to forestall and ameliorate a liquidity crisis. 1 Regulators have taken steps to im- prove the liquidity of banks since the ﬁnancial crisis.

We propose deﬁning readability as the effective communication of valuation-relevant information. The Fog Index—the most commonly applied readability measure—is shown to be poorly speciﬁed in ﬁnancial applications. Of Fog’s two components, one is misspeciﬁed and the other is difﬁcult to measure. We report that 10-K document ﬁle size provides a simple readability proxy that outperforms the Fog Index, does not require document parsing, facilitates replication, and is correlated with alternative readability constructs. “Just as the Black-Scholes model is a commonplace when it comes to com- pliance with the stock option compensation rules, we may soon be looking to the Gunning-Fog and Flesch-Kincaid models to judge the level of com- pliance with the plain English rules.” Business, March 23, 2007 Managers OF PUBLICLYtraded ﬁrms are required to produce public documents that provide a comprehensive review of the ﬁrm’s business operations and ﬁnancial condition.

    "abstract": "We formalize the concept of “dark matter” in asset pricing models by quantifying the additional informativeness of cross-equation restrictions about fundamental dynam- ics. The dark-matter measure captures the degree of fragility for models that are potentially misspeciﬁed and unstable: a large dark-matter measure indicates that the model lacks internal refutability (weak power of optimal speciﬁcation tests) and external validity (high overﬁtting tendency and poor out-of-sample ﬁt). The measure can be computed at low cost even for complex dynamic structural models. To illustrate its applications, we provide quantitative examples applying the measure to (time- varying) rare-disaster risk and long-run risk models. IN Cosmology , Dark Matter IS a form of substance that is not directly ob- servable, yet its presence is required for Einstein’s theory of general relativity to be consistent with the observable motions of stars and galaxies. Certain economic models rely on an analogous form of “dark matter.” For instance, to generate desirable predictions, many asset pricing models require subtle dy- namics for the fundamentals (the process of endowment or productivity, e.g.) that are difﬁcult to identify directly using the fundamental data alone. In- stead, the evidence can only be indirectly inferred from asset prices through the lens of model-implied restrictions.

    "abstract": "By reaching a broad population of investors, mass media can alleviate informational frictions and affect security pricing even if it does not supply genuine news. We investi- gate this hypothesis by studying the cross-sectional relation between media coverage and expected stock returns. We find that stocks with no media coverage earn higher returns than stocks with high media coverage even after controlling for well-known risk factors. These results are more pronounced among small stocks and stocks with high individual ownership, low analyst following, and high idiosyncratic volatility. Our findings suggest that the breadth of information dissemination affects stock returns. Mass Media Outlets, such as newspapers, play an important role in disseminat- ing information to a broad audience, especially to individual investors. Every weekday, some 55 million newspaper copies are sold to individual readers in the United States, reaching about 20% of the nation’s population. If we con- sider online subscriptions and multiple readers per copy, the actual readership of the printed press is even larger, and certainly far broader than other sources of corporate information such as analyst reports. Given mass media’s broad reach, one might expect it to affect securities markets. Interest in the relation between media and the market has been on the rise among both researchers and practitioners.

    "abstract": "We show that public banks face negative stock return jumps after missing their earn- ings per share (EPS) targets, and theoretically and quantitatively link these jumps to bunching behavior in the EPS surprise distribution. Bunching banks cut deposit rates to meet their targets, but do so at the expense of deposit outﬂows and fran- chise value losses. Local competitors, including private banks unexposed to capital market pressure, increase deposit rates, compensating depositors for switching. Our results provide new evidence that performance targeting incentives can affect con- sumer product prices, and suggest that competition may provide a check on public ﬁrms’ targeting efforts. Performance Targeting IS AN Economically relevant and pervasive phenomenon in modern ﬁnancial markets. In recent years, performance target- ing and its prejudicial counterpart “quarterly capitalism” (Barton (2011)) have gained attention in industry, policy, and academic circles.

    "abstract": "We study equilibrium firm-level stock returns in two economies: one in which in- vestors are loss averse over the fluctuations of their stock portfolio, and another in which they are loss averse over the fluctuations of individual stocks that they own. Both approaches can shed light on empirical phenomena, but we find the second approach to be more successful: In that economy, the typical individual stock re- turn has a high mean and excess volatility, and there is a large value premium in the cross section which can, to some extent, be captured by a commonly used multi- factor model. Over THE Past TWO Decades, researchers analyzing the structure of individual stock returns have uncovered a wide range of phenomena, both in the time series and the cross section. In the time series, the returns of a typical in- dividual stock have a high mean, are excessively volatile, and are slightly predictable using lagged variables. In the cross section, there is a substan- tial \"value\" premium, in that stocks with low ratios of price to fundamentals have higher average returns, and this premium can to some extent be cap- tured by certain empirically motivated multifactor models., These findings have attracted a good deal of attention from finance theorists. It has proved something of a challenge, though, to explain both the time series and cross- sectional effects in the context of an equilibrium model where investors max- imize a clearly specified utility function.

    "abstract": "Do preoffer target stock price runups increase bidder takeover costs? We present model-based tests of this issue assuming runups are caused by signals that inform investors about potential takeover synergies. Rational deal anticipation implies a relation between target runups and markups (offer value minus runup) that is greater than minus one-for-one and inherently nonlinear. If merger negotiations force bidders to raise the offer with the runup—a costly feedback loop where bidders pay twice for anticipated target synergies—markups become strictly increasing in runups. Large- sample tests support rational deal anticipation in runups while rejecting the costly feedback loop. Takeover Bids ARE Typically preceded by substantial target stock price runups. The literature often characterizes such runups as the discounted value of target deal synergies triggered by takeover rumors. As such, the runups are exogenous to the deal and should not affect deal terms. Yet, Schwert (1996) reports that, in a sample of takeovers, the market’s valuation of the offer itself is increasing in the runup, almost dollar for dollar. It is as if bidders increase the offer price by the runup, which would amount to paying twice for the target’s portion of deal-speciﬁc synergies embedded in the runup. In this paper, we develop and empirically test a simple takeover model with rational agents that permits this type of costly feedback loop from target runups to deal terms.

    "abstract": "Q-based measures of the diversiﬁcation discount are biased upward by mergers and acquisitions and its accounting implications. Under purchase accounting, acquired assets are reported at their transaction value, which typically exceeds the target’s pre-merger book value. Thus, measured q tends to be lower for the merged ﬁrm than for the portfolio of pre-merger entities. Because conglomerates are more acquisitive than focused ﬁrms, their q tends to be lower. To mitigate this bias, I subtract goodwill from the book value of assets and a substantial part of the diversiﬁcation discount is eliminated. Market-to-sales-based measures do not have this bias. A Large Proportion OF ﬁnancial economics studies, from corporate ﬁnance to asset pricing, use accounting data to compute various measures and proxies. When ﬁrms are exposed to different accounting treatments, these measures might be compromised by the lack of comparability across ﬁrms. Measures of the diversiﬁcation discount based on Tobin’sq are an example of this problem. Most studies of corporate diversiﬁcation ﬁnd that, on average, conglomerates have a lower value than industry-matched portfolios of focused ﬁrms. 1 Several explanations for this diversiﬁcation discount have been examined. First, con- glomerates might be less efﬁcient than focused ﬁrms because of agency costs cated to the memory of Antoine Faure-Grimaud.

    "abstract": "Using novel data from the pharmaceutical industry, we study product prices and in- novation around mergers. Exploiting within-deal variation in product market consoli- dation, we show that prices increase more for drugs in consolidating markets than for matched control drugs. Estimates indicate a 2% average price effect that persists for about one year. Price increases expand with acquirer-target product similarity and are more pronounced within less competitive product markets with fewer players and no generic competition. Examination of trade-offs reveals these deals generate signif- icant shareholder value. They also spur labeling and other manufacturing-related innovation, but not the development of new drugs. That Mergers AND Acquisitions Generate shareholder value is generally accepted (Betton, Eckbo, and Thorburn ( 2008)). How mergers beneﬁt share- holders and how they affect the costs that other stakeholders incur are less clear. Industry consolidation can create value through synergies, leading to efﬁciency gains and lower product prices (Sheen ( 2014)). Mergers can also re- sult in technology sharing, which stimulates innovation (Bena and Li ( 2014)).

    "abstract": "Merton Miller's status as a father of finance reflects the academic depth, breadth, and rigor of his writings and two important facets of his character. Merton was a man of great warmth and humor. He communicated his often challenging views via memorable phrases and anecdotes that have become part of the everyday lan- guage of the profession. Merton was also a man of great dedication. The whole profession has benefited from his devotion to his doctoral students, to his col- leagues, and to his coauthors. This essay demonstrates how Merton's admiration LiKE Many Others, I WAS THE Beneficiary of Merton Miller's untiring efforts as a thesis supervisor and guide. And like others at their first meeting with Merton, I was struck by the holes at the elbow of his sweater. We all soon learned that Merton's focus was on the important things, ideas and their communication, and not on his wardrobe. Ideas and their communication led Merton to many an academic collaboration. The classic Modigliani-Miller (M&M) propositions are the fruit of joint work with Franco Modigliani, a Nobel laureate in his own right. Together M&M published 11 pieces. In fact, Merton wrote with 41 different coauthors. A listing of Merton's books, jour- The Merton Miller Bibliography.' This essay traces the common thread of I. Academic Biography 1944.

Merton Miller was a renowned academic mentor. He was our champion. In my view, Merton was our Leonardo da Vinci. Merton's genius defined the field of financial economics. He was a visionary, a man of intense curiosity, with a willingness to embrace ambi- guity and use his brilliant intuition throughout his illustrious research ca- reer to overturn a multitude of long-held \"truths.\" Merton's research shows the same grace that Merton showed himself. He always tested knowledge and used his love of science, logic, art, literature, and music as a balance to create knowledge. Merton's research exhibits a marvelous interconnected- ness to once seemingly unrelated ideas. He has left us a research legacy that will be treasured for generations to come. Discussing ideas with Merton, whether at the lunch table at the Faculty Club or in a car going to a downtown class, or at dinner afterwards, or the myriad times you would meet up with him at some foreign conference or in his or your office working on a research paper, was always inspiring or syn- ergistic. He had so many ideas. He was easily able to marry your ideas with his own, and new and exciting ideas followed on, one after the other. This was a purely fun, invigorating, draining to some extent, but nevertheless, an intoxicating experience. I remember",

    "title": "Methods of Payment in Asset Sales: Contracting",
    "abstract": "We analyze intercorporate asset sales where equity is the means of payment, and compare the results to cash asset sales. Equity deals are value-enhancing for both buyers, 10%, and sellers, 3%, while cash sales generate seller returns of 1.9% and buyer returns that are not significant. Combined wealth gains are large for equity deals, but modest for cash deals. Equity-based asset sales are not a precursor to consolidations between buyers and sellers, and do not affect buyer openness to the takeover market. We conclude that the use of buyer equity conveys favorable information about the value of assets and buyers. Is that the issuance of equity reduces firm value. In this paper, we present evidence that challenges this widely held view about equity. Losses in firm value have been documented when equity is used as a means of payment for corporate transactions such as mergers and takeovers, as well as for seasoned equity offerings for corporate financing. Such negative effects on firm value are consistent with the theoretical work of Myers and Majluf (1984), which implies that within an asymmetric information framework, there is an adverse selection problem intrinsic to equity issuance. Our evidence about the favorable effects of equity is in the context of intercorporate asset sales. There are no theoretical models that focus explicitly on corporate asset sales. Instead, these transactions are typically viewed as a component of the broader merger and takeover literature, which c",

    "abstract": "A goal for stock exchanges is to increase participation by ﬁrms and investors. We show how speciﬁc features of the microstructure can reduce perceived ambiguity, and induce participation by both investors and issuers. We develop a model with sophisticated traders, who we view as expected utility maximizers with rational expectations, and unsophisticated traders, who we view as rational traders facing ambiguity about the payoffs to participating in the market. We show how designing markets to reduce ambiguity can beneﬁt investors through greater liquidity, exchanges through greater volume, and issuing ﬁrms through a lower cost of capital. A General Goal FOR Stock Exchanges is to increase participation by ﬁrms and investors. There is a direct reason for doing so as trade executions and listing fees generate revenue for exchanges, and both of these are increased by greater participation. 1 But there is also an indirect channel as more volume begets lower spreads, which lowers execution costs, which induces more volume, which then generates more proﬁts. This cycle suggests that exchanges and investors both gain from greater participation and that society as a whole may beneﬁt from increased participation in stock markets if it lowers the equity premium. How, then, can an exchange increase participation in its market? Pation and asset prices is ambiguity aversion. Ambiguity-averse investors do not act as if there is a single distribution of payoffs to assets; instead they act as i",

    "title": "Misspeciﬁed Recovery",
    "abstract": "Asset prices contain information about the probability distribution of future states and the stochastic discounting of those states as used by investors. To better under- stand the challenge in distinguishing investors’ beliefs from risk-adjusted discount- ing, we use Perron–Frobenius Theory to isolate a positive martingale component of the stochastic discount factor process. This component recovers a probability mea- sure that absorbs long-term risk adjustments. When the martingale is not degenerate, surmising that this recovered probability captures investors’ beliefs distorts inference about risk-return tradeoffs. Stochastic discount factors in many structural models of asset prices have empirically relevant martingale components. Asset Prices ARE Forward Looking and encode information about investors’ beliefs. This leads researchers and policy makers to look at ﬁnancial market data to gauge the views of the private sector about the future of the macroecon- omy. It has been known, at least since the path-breaking work of Arrow, that asset prices reﬂect a combination of investors’ risk aversion and the probability distributions used to assess risk. In dynamic models, investors’ risk aversion is expressed by stochastic discount factors that include compensation for risk exposures. In this paper, we ask what can be learned from Arrow prices about investors’ beliefs. Data on asset prices alone are not sufﬁcient to identify both the stochastic discount factors and transition pr",

    "title": "Model Misspecification and Underdiversification",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we study intertemporal portfolio choice when an investor ac- counts explicitly for model misspecification. We develop a framework that al- lows for ambiguity about not just the joint distribution of returns for all stocks in the portfolio, but also for different levels of ambiguity for the marginal dis- tribution of returns for any subset of these stocks. We find that when the overall ambiguity about the joint distribution of returns is high, then small differ- ences in ambiguity for the marginal return distribution will result in a portfo- lio that is significantly under diversifie d relative to the standard mean- variance portfolio. Traditional rational expectations models of portfolio choice assume that inves- tors know perfectly the true probability law governing the stochastic processes of asset returns. However, in many situations agents are uncertain about the true model,1 and hence any particular probability law used to describe the asset return processes would be subject to potential model misspecification. How do agents act in such situations? One possibility is that they summarize their uncer- tainty using a probability distribution. However, evidence from experimental economics and psychology (Ellsberg (1961)) suggests that in some situations agents' uncertainty cannot be expressed using a single probability distribution; that is, there is ambiguity. The objective of this paper is to develop a model of intertemporal portfolio choice in which investo",

    "title": "Model Secrecy and Stress Tests",
    "abstract": "Should regulators reveal the models they use to stress-test banks? In our setting, revealing leads to gaming, but secrecy can induce banks to underinvest in socially desirable assets for fear of failing the test. We show that although the regulator can solve this underinvestment problem by making the test easier, some disclosure may still be optimal (e.g., if banks have high appetite for risk or if capital shortfalls are not very costly). Cutoff rules are optimal within monotone disclosure rules, but more generally optimal disclosure is single-peaked. We discuss policy implications and offer applications beyond stress tests. From THE Early Days OF Bank stress tests in the wake of the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis, disclosure has been a key subject of interest among practitioners, academics, and regulators. Most of the academic discussion centers on public disclosure of the test results (e.g., Goldstein and Sapra (2014), Goldstein and Leitner (2018)); whether regulators should disclose the models they use to forecast bank capital when conducting stress test has received less attention. The latter question has recently gained momentum among policy makers and practitioners, however, leading to a change in the Federal Reserves’s policy . Under the old policy , the Federal Reserve provided only a broad description of its stress test models. Under the new policy , the Fed provides more informa- tion on certain equations and variables, and illustrates how its models work on hypothetical loan",

    "title": "Model Specification and Risk Premia:",
    "abstract": "This paper examines model specification issues and estimates diffusive and jump risk premia using S&P futures option prices from 1987 to 2003. We first develop a time series test to detect the presence of jumps in volatility, and find strong evidence in support of their presence. Next, using the cross section of option prices, we find strong evidence for jumps in prices and modest evidence for jumps in volatility based on model fit. The evidence points toward economically and statistically significant jump risk premia, which are important for understanding option returns. There ARE TWO Central , Related, issues in empirical option pricing. The first issue is model specification, which comprises identifying and modeling the fac- tors that jointly determine returns and option prices. Recent empirical work on index options identifies factors such as stochastic volatility, jumps in prices, and jumps in volatility. The second issue is quantifying the risk premia associ- ated with the jump and diffusive factors using a model that passes reasonable specification hurdles. The results in the literature regarding these issues are mixed. For exam- ple, tests using option data disagree over the importance of jumps in prices: Bakshi, Cao, and Chen (1997) (BCC) find substantial benefits from including jumps in prices, whereas Bates (2000) and others find that such benefits are economically small, if not negligible. 1 Furthermore, while studies using the time series of returns unanimously s",

    "title": "Model Uncertainty and Option Markets",
    "abstract": "This paper provides option pricing and volume implications for an economy with het- erogeneous agents who face model uncertainty and have different beliefs on expected returns. Market incompleteness makes options nonredundant, while heterogeneity creates a link between differences in beliefs and option volumes. We solve for both option prices and volumes and test the joint empirical implications using S&P500 index option data. Specifically, we use survey data to build an Index of Dispersion in Beliefs and find that a model that takes information heterogeneity into account can explain the dynamics of option volume and the smile better than can reduced-form models with stochastic volatility. THE Notion That Options CAN BE Replicated via a dynamic trading strategy in the underlying asset (Black and Scholes (1973)) has been one of the most in- fluential innovations in the theory of financial markets. That concept allowed the development of pricing and risk management models of option and other complex financial instruments. However, the traditional no-arbitrage approach with deterministic volatility is silent with respect to option trading volume: Since options are redundant securities, agents are indifferent about holding them and thus their trading volume is indeterminate. On the other hand, the last two decades have witnessed an impressive proliferation of options and other derivative securities, with option open interest in all main option ex- changes increasing tenfold in 15",

    "title": "Model-Free International Stochastic",
    "abstract": "We provide a theoretical framework to uncover in a model-free way the relationships among international stochastic discount factors (SDFs), stochastic wedges, and ﬁnan- cial market structures. Exchange rates are in general different from the ratio of in- ternational SDFs in incomplete markets, as captured by a stochastic wedge. We show theoretically that this wedge can be zero in incomplete and integrated markets. Mar- ket segmentation breaks the strong link between exchange rates and international SDFs, which helps address salient features of international asset returns while keep- ing the volatility and cross-country correlation of SDFs at moderate levels. THE Financial Crisis Provided AT least two insights into the workings of international ﬁnancial markets. First, it was a reminder that despite the pro- gressive removal of trade barriers such as capital controls and taxes, cross- border investment activity can be severely disrupted. Indeed, recent empirical evidence shows that international market segmentation remains a pervasive feature even in the most liquid and developed markets (see Camanho, Hau, and Rey (2018) for international equities and Maggiori, Neiman, and Schreger (2020) for international ﬁxed income markets).

    "abstract": "We propose a novel factor model for option returns. Option exposures are estimated nonparametrically, and factor risk premia can vary nonlinearly with states. The model is estimated using regressions with minimal assumptions on factor and op- tion return dynamics. We estimate the model using index options to characterize the conditional risk premia for factors of interest, such as the market return, mar- ket variance, tail and intermediary risk factors, higher moments, and the VIX term structure slope. Together, market return and variance explain more than 90% of op- tion return variation. Unconditionally, the magnitude of the variance risk premium is plausible. It displays pronounced time variation, spikes during crises, and always has the expected sign. Because OF THE State -contingent Nature of their payoffs, options are highly informative about state prices and the price of risk. Traditionally, the index and stock option literature has studied option prices. This contrasts with the literature on the underlying securities, which focuses almost exclusively on returns.

    "title": "Modeling Corporate Bond Returns",
    "abstract": "We propose a conditional factor model for corporate bond returns with ﬁve factors and time-varying factor loadings. We have three main empirical ﬁndings. First, our factor model excels in describing the risks and returns of corporate bonds, improving over previously proposed models in the literature by a large margin. Second, our model recommends a systematic bond investment portfolio whose high out-of-sample Sharpe ratio suggests that the credit risk premium is notably larger than previously estimated. Third, we ﬁnd closer integration between debt and equity markets than found in prior literature. ASO F 2019, Global Bond markets’ outstanding value was $105.9 trillion, whereas global equity market capitalization was $95 trillion (sifma (2020)). In the United States, there was approximately $9.5 trillion of U.S. Corporate debt outstanding, compared to $30 trillion in market capitalization of U.S. Pub- lic equities. U.S. Corporate bond issuance totaled roughly $1.4 trillion in 2019, versus $228 billion for U.S. Equity . Despite the similarity in their size and im- portance to the economy , however, academic understanding of the risk-return trade-off is less developed in corporate bond markets than in equity markets. Recent literature has started to map out a factor structure in corporate bond returns.

    "abstract": "We construct a model for pricing sovereign debt that accounts for the risks of both default and restructuring, and allows for compensation for illiquidity. Using a new and relatively efficient method, we estimate the model using Rus- sian dollar-denominated bonds. We consider the determinants of the Russian yield spread, the yield differential across different Russian bonds, and the im- plications for market integration, relative liquidity, relative expected recovery rates, and implied expectations of different default scenarios. This Paper Develops A Model of the term structure of credit spreads on sover- eign bonds that accommodates: (i) Default or repudiation: The sovereign an- nounces that it will stop making payments on its debt; (ii) Restructuring or renegotiation: The sovereign and the lenders \"agree\" to reduce (or postpone) the remaining payments; and (iii) A\"regime switch,\" such as a change of government or the default of another sovereign bond that changes the perceived risk of future defaults. We build on the framework of Duffie and Singleton (1999), showing that cash flows promised by a sovereign bond can be discounted using a default-ad- justed short-term discount rate that reflects the mean arrival rate, and asso- ciated losses in market value upon arrival, of each of the aforementioned types of credit events. Since a sovereign credit event is often not a \"liquidation event\": the model allows for continued trading (and pricing) of a sovereign instrument through",

    "title": "Momentum Investing and Business Cycle Risk:",
    "abstract": "We examine whether macroeconomic risk can explain momentum profits in- ternationally. Neither an unconditional model based on the Chen, Roll, and Ross (1986) factors nor a conditional forecasting model based on lagged instru- ments provides any evidence that macroeconomic risk variables can explain momentum. In addition, momentum profits around the world are economically large and statistically reliable in both good and bad economic states. Further, these momentum profits reverse over 1- to 5 -year horizons, an action inconsis- tent with existing risk-based explanations of momentum. The phenomenon of momentum, continuation of the direction of prior stock re- turns, has proved to be a challenge to financial economists. The simple investing strategy of buying prior winners and selling short prior losers appears signifi- cantly profitable both statistically and economically. Indeed, a growing body of both theoretical and empirical literature has examined several possible explana- tions, among them data mining, behavioral patterns, and risk. On the available evidence, data mining is an unlikely explanation. Since the Jegadeesh andTitman (1993) study of U.S. Stock returns, \"out-of-sample\" evidence of momentum has amassed both geographically and temporally. As shown in stu- dies by Rouwenhorst (1998, 1999) and Chui,Titman, and Wei (2000), momentum is economically large in many European markets, small but positive in many emer- ging markets, and, furthermore, present in at least fiv",

    "abstract": "We document the equity trading practices of approximately 1,200 institutions from the third quarter of 1987 through the third quarter of 1995. We decompose trading by institutions into the initiation of new positions (entry), the termination of pre- vious positions (exit), and adjustments to ongoing holdings. Institutions act as mo- mentum traders when they enter stocks but as contrarian traders when they exit or make adjustments to ongoing holdings. We find significant differences in trad- ing practices among different types of institutions. IN A Celebrated Article published almost a half century ago, Friedman (1953) argues that rational speculation must stabilize asset prices. More recently, DeLong et al. (1990) show that momentum traders (also referred to as trend chasers or positive feedback traders) can, in fact, destabilize stock prices and thereby threaten the efficiency of financial markets. DeLong et al.'s proof has inspired numerous empirical investigations that focus almost exclu- sively on the behavior of institutional investors. There are at least two rea- sons for this focus. First, a large fraction of corporate equity is held by institutional investors; institutional ownership of shares in U.S. Firms in- creased from approximately 7 percent in 1950 to over 50 percent in 1999 (Federal Reserve Board, 2000). Second, institutions are frequently alleged to herd and to follow potentially destabilizing investment strategies (see, e.g., Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny",

    "title": "Momentum and Credit Rating",
    "abstract": "This paper establishes a robust link between momentum and credit rating. Momentum profitability is large and significant among low-grade firms, but it is nonexistent among high-grade firms. The momentum payoffs documented in the literature are generated by low-grade firms that account for less than 4% of the overall market capitalization of rated firms. The momentum payoff differential across credit rating groups is unexplained by firm size, firm age, analyst forecast dispersion, leverage, return volatility, and cash flow volatility. Jegadeesh AND Titman (1993) Document that the momentum-based trading strat- egy of buying past winners and selling past losers provides statistically signif- icant and economically large payoffs. The empirical evidence on stock return momentum is intriguing because it points to a violation of weak-form mar- ket efficiency. In particular, Fama and French (1996) show that momentum profitability is the only CAPM-related anomaly unexplained by the Fama and French (1993) three-factor model. Moreover, Schwert (2003) demonstrates that market anomalies related to profit opportunities, including the size and value effects in the cross-section of average returns as well as time-series predictabil- ity of returns by the dividend yield, typically disappear, reverse, or attenuate following their discovery. In contrast, Jegadeesh and Titman (2001, 2002) docu- ment the profitability of momentum strategies after their initial discovery. The robustness of momentu",

    "title": "Momentum and Reversals in Equity-Index Returns",
    "abstract": "We document new patterns in the dynamics between stock returns and trad- ing volume. Specifically, we find substantial momentum (reversals) in conse- cutive weekly returns when the latter week has unexpectedly high (low) turnover. This pattern is evident in equity indices, index futures, and indivi- dual stocks. Similarly, we also find that the autocorrelation in equity-index returns is increasing with the unexpected dispersion across the latter week's firm-level returns. Weeks with extreme turnover and dispersion shocks (both high and low) tend to have more macroeconomic news releases. Our findings bear on understanding price formation and the economic interpretation of turnover and dispersion shocks. IN This Paper, we document new patterns in the dynamics between stock returns and trading volume. Specifically, we find substantial momentum in consecutive weekly stock returns when the latter week has abnormally high turnover.' Con- versely, we find substantial reversals in consecutive weekly returns when the lat- ter week has abnormally low turnover. By abnormal turnover, we mean the shock in the turnover time series after controlling for its autoregressive properties and for normal movements with the market return.2 We find this return pattern in equity indices, index futures, individual stocks, and in the U.S., Japan, and U.K. Stock markets.

    "abstract": "A growing number of researchers argue that time-series patterns in returns are due to investor irrationality and thus can be translated into abnormal profits. Continuation of short-term returns or momentum is one such pattern that has defied any rational explanation and is at odds with market efficiency. This paper shows that profits to momentum strategies can be explained by a set of lagged macroeconomic variables and payoffs to momentum strategies disappear once stock returns are adjusted for their predictability based on these macroeconomic vari- ables. Our results provide a possible role for time-varying expected returns as an explanation for momentum payoffs. This Paper Examines THE Relative importance of common factors and firm- specific information in explaining the profitability of momentum-based trad- ing strategies, first documented by Jegadeesh and Titman (1993). The profitability of momentum strategies has been particularly intriguing, as it remains the only CAPM-related anomaly unexplained by the Fama-French three-factor model (Fama and French (1996)). Jegadeesh and Titman (2001) show that profits to momentum strategies continued in the 1990s, suggest- ing that their initial results were not due to data mining. Furthermore, the robustness of this strategy has been confirmed using data from stock mar- kets other than the United States, where the profitability of this strategy was initially identified.

    "title": "Momentum, Reversal, and Uninformed Traders",
    "abstract": "We report the results of three experiments based on the model of Hong and Stein (1999). Consistent with the model, the results show that when informed traders do not observe prices, uninformed traders generate long-term price reversals by engaging in momentum trade. However, when informed traders also observe prices, uninformed traders generate reversals by engaging in contrarian trading. The results suggest that a dominated information set is sufficient to account for the contrarian behavior observed among individual investors, and that uninformed traders may be responsible for long-term price reversals but play little role in driving short-term momentum. Archival Studies Provide extensive evidence of short-term price momentum and long-term price reversal.1 We report the results of three experiments intended vironments, and test how the behavior of uninformed traders influences these phenomena. Our results suggest that momentum is a robust phenomenon when news is disseminated slowly across traders, whereas long-term reversals arise only in the presence of uninformed traders. Uninformed traders act as trend- chasers when informed traders cannot condition on market price, but as con- trarians when informed traders can condition on price. In the former setting, uniformed traders create long-term reversals by creating overreactions to in- formation, which are subsequently reversed (as in the model of Hong and Stein (1999)). In the latter setting, they create long-term reversals",

    "abstract": "This paper explores the role of trade invoicing currencies in the international spillover of monetary policy . Using high-frequency measures of Federal Reserve mon- etary policy shocks, I show that exchange rates, interest rates, and equity returns in countries with a larger share of dollar-invoiced imports systematically respond more to U.S. Monetary policy . I document similar transmission effects from European Cen- tral Bank (ECB) monetary policy shocks to countries with euro-invoiced imports. I rationalize these ﬁndings within a New Keynesian framework. As a result of these spillovers, domestic monetary policy should be less effective in countries with traded goods invoiced in foreign currencies. THE Actions OF THE U.S. Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) are of fundamental importance for central bankers around the world. A growing literature ﬁnds that monetary policy actions of the United States signiﬁcantly impact macroe- conomic conditions and asset prices globally (Rey (2013), Miranda-Agrippino and Rey (2020)). What features of the global economy allow the FRB to inﬂu- ence global macroeconomic conditions, and to what extent do monetary policy actions from other central banks also inﬂuence outcomes abroad?

    "abstract": "We analyzeoptimal monetary policy and its implications for asset prices when aggre- gate demand has inertia. If there is a negative output gap, the central bank optimally overshoots aggregate asset prices (above their steady-state levels consistent with cur- rent potential output). Overshooting leads to a temporary disconnect between the performance of ﬁnancial markets and the real economy, but accelerates the recovery. When there is a lower bound constraint on the discount rate, good macroeconomic news is better news for asset prices when the output gap is more negative. Finally, we document that during the Covid-19 recovery, the policy-induced overshooting was large. THE Initial Recovery From THE Covid-19 recession featured a large dis- connect between the performance of the real economy and ﬁnancial markets. The left panel of Figure1 shows that, by the end of 2020, U.S. Output was still signiﬁcantly below its long-run potential, whereas stock prices (as well as house and bond prices) vastly exceeded their prepandemic levels.1 The robust recovery of asset markets was primarily due to the aggressive monetary (and ﬁscal) policy response to the Covid-19 shock. During the early stages of the recession, monetary policy stabilized asset prices by containing and then re- versing the large spike in the risk premium (see, for example, Caballero and Simsek (2021a)). Subsequently, monetary policy supported asset prices by keeping short and long interest rates low. By the end of 2020,",

To interpret these ﬁndings, we estimate a novel macro- ﬁnance model of monetary transmission and ﬁnd that the documented regimes co- incide with shifts in the parameters of a policy rule, with long-term consequences for the real interest rate. Estimates imply that two-thirds of the decline in the real interest rate since the early 1980s is attributable to regime changes in monetary pol- icy. The model explains how infrequent changes in the stance of monetary policy can generate persistent changes in asset valuations and the equity premium.

    "abstract": "When central banks adjust interest rates, the opportunity cost of lending in local currency changes, but—absent frictions—there is no spillover effect to lending in other currencies. However, when equity capital is limited, global banks must bench- mark domestic and foreign lending opportunities. We show that, in equilibrium, the marginal return on foreign lending is affected by the interest rate differential, with lower domestic rates leading to an increase in local lending, at the expense of a re- duction in foreign lending. We test our prediction in the context of changes in interest rates in six major currency areas. Foreign (“global ”) Banks Play AN important role in many countries. Ac- cording to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), as of June 2015, Eu- ropean and Japanese banks’ claims on U.S. Nonbank ﬁrms were USD 1.61 and 0.72 trillion, respectively. DealScan data indicate that foreign banks help orig- inate close to a quarter of all syndicated corporate loans in the United States. Similarly, U.S. Banks are important lenders abroad: as of June 2015, U.S. Banks held the equivalent of USD 0.74 and 0.11 trillion in claims on European and Japanese nonbank companies, respectively.

    "abstract": "Using data on individual portfolio holdings and on mutual fund ﬂows, we ﬁnd that low interest rates lead to signiﬁcantly higher demand for income-generating assets such as high-dividend stocks and high-yield bonds. We argue that this “reaching- for-income” phenomenon is driven by investors who follow the “living off income” rule-of-thumb. Our empirical analysis shows that this preference for current income affects both household portfolio choices and the prices of income-generating assets. In addition, we explore the implications of reaching for income for capital allocation and the effectiveness of monetary policy . AN Asset’s Total Return CAN be broken down into two components: current income and capital gains. Miller and Modigliani (1961) show that in friction- less capital markets, rational investors should be indifferent between these two sources of return. However, this core tenet of ﬁnancial economics is at odds with a large body of popular retail investment advice that advocates liv- ing off the income stream from one’s investment portfolio while keeping the principal untapped.1 Investors who follow this “rule of thumb” structure their investment portfolio not only to maximize their risk-adjusted return but also to two anonymous referees, and those of Malcolm Baker (discussant), Bo Becker (discussant), Gio- vanni Gallipoli, Michael Gallmeyer (discussant), Mathias Kronlund (discussant), Yueran Ma (dis- cussant), Paul Tetlock, Terrance Odean, Michaela Pagel, Xiao Qiao (",

We develop a two-stage approach and apply it to the Chinese economy with a conﬁdential loan-level data set that covers all sectors.

This ﬁscal-monetary interaction channel is key to understanding the preferential credit access enjoyed by state-owned ﬁrms during the stimulus period.

    "abstract": "We present a new model of investors delegating portfolio management to professionals based on trust. Trust in the manager reduces an investor’s perception of the riskiness of a given investment, and allows managers to charge fees. Money managers compete for investor funds by setting fees, but because of trust, fees do not fall to costs. In equilibrium, fees are higher for assets with higher expected return, managers on average underperform the market net of fees, but investors nevertheless prefer to hire managers to investing on their own. When investors hold biased expectations, trust causes managers to pander to investor beliefs. IT HAS Been Known since Jensen (1968) that professional money managers on average underperform passive investment strategies net of fees. Gruber (1996) estimates average mutual fund underperformance of 65 basis points per year; French ( 2008) updates this to 67 basis points per year. But such poor performance of mutual funds is only the tip of the iceberg. Many investors pay substantial fees to brokers and investment advisors, who then direct them toward the mutual funds that underperform (Bergstresser, Chalmers, and Tufano ( 2009), Del Guercio, Reuter, and Tkac ( 2010), Chalmers and Reuter (2012), Hackethal, Haliassos, and Jappelli ( 2012)). Once all fees are taken into account, some studies ﬁnd 2% investor underperformance relative to indexation. 1 This evidence is difﬁcult to reconcile with the view that investors are comfortable investing in a",

Optimal monetary architecture minimizes the social costs of liquidity provision, and optimal monetary policy follows modiﬁed Friedman rules. Interest rates on reserves and Cbdc should differ. Calibrations robustly suggest that Cbdc provides liquidity more efﬁciently than deposits unless the central bank must reﬁnance banks and this is very costly . Accordingly , the optimal share of Cbdc in payments tends to exceed that of deposits. THE Prospect OF Retail Central bank digital currency (cbdc) rekindles interest in the architecture of the monetary system. In modern economies, this architecture exhibits two tiers: nonbanks transact using bank deposits or claims on deposits, and banks settle payments with central bank–issued reserves.

    "abstract": "We study how well-incentivized boards monitor CEOs and whether monitoring im- proves performance. Using unique, detailed data on boards’ information sets and decisions for a large sample of private equity–backed ﬁrms, we ﬁnd that gathering information helps boards learn about CEO ability. “Soft” information plays a much larger role than hard data, such as the performance metrics that prior literature fo- cuses on, and helps avoid ﬁring a CEO for bad luck or in response to adverse external shocks. We show that governance reforms increase the effectiveness of board mon- itoring and establish a causal link between forced CEO turnover and performance improvements. Boards OF Directors ARE tasked with ensuring that ﬁrms are run by compe- tent managers who act in their shareholders’ interest. This involves not only the provision of appropriate incentives but also what Tirole (2001) calls active monitoring. An active monitor collects information about the ﬁrm’s operations or the manager’s ability and—in contrast to a passive monitor such as a ﬁnan- cial analyst, rating agency, or the media—is in a position to ﬁre the manager if he believes ﬁrm value is not being maximized. As monitoring beneﬁts all investors while being privately costly to provide, directors are more likely to engage in monitoring if they have skin in the game. In practice, therefore, we expect active monitoring to be more prevalent among ﬁrms with sufﬁciently large shareholders (Shleifer and Vishny (1986)). Of Busin",

    "abstract": "We examine whether mandating banks to issue subordinated debt would enhance market monitoring and control risk taking. To evaluate whether subordinated debt enhances risk monitoring, we extract the credit-spread curve for each banking firm in our sample and examine whether changes in credit spreads reflect changes in bank risk variables, after controlling for changes in market and liquidity variables. We do not find strong and consistent evidence that they do. To evaluate whether subordi- nated debt controls risk taking, we examine whether the first issue of subordinated debt changes the risk-taking behavior of a bank. We find that it does not. Policymakers ARE Actively Considering requiring banks to issue subordinated notes and debentures (SND). A mandatory SND requirement appears to be an important part of the market-oriented reforms, contained in the consultative paper issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (1999). The U.S. Shadow Regulatory Committee has come out strongly in favor of mandatory SND as a mechanism for realizing enhanced market discipline of banks. More- over, the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act of 1999 mandated a joint Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury study of bank SND requirements. This legislation also re- quires all large banking firms to have at least one issue of SND outstanding at all times. Proponents of mandatory SND regulation suggest that SND will enhance market discipline and curb excessive risk taking in two ways: through risk monitoring a",

    "title": "Monitoring and Structure of Debt Contracts",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a theory of optimal debt structure when the moral hazard problem is severe. The main idea is that the optimal debt contract delegates mon- itoring to a single senior lender and that seniority allows the monitoring senior lender to appropriate the full return from his monitoring activities. The theory explains (i) why debt contracts are prioritized, (ii) why short-term debt is senior to long-term debt, and (iii) why financial intermediaries usually hold short-term senior debt whereas long-term junior debt is widely held. Another implication of the theory is that covenant and maturity structures will be set to conform to the seniority structure. When a firm becomes highly leveraged, its debt contracts are often priori- tized into several classes, so that, in the event of bankruptcy liquidation, some lenders will have claims on the firm's assets before others do. The most common financing pattern consists of senior bank debt with public debt sub- ordinate to it. Another common characteristic is that senior bank debt usu- ally has a shorter maturity and a more restrictive set of covenants than junior public debt.' When we consider banks as delegated monitors who specialize in infor- mation gathering, it seems puzzling that banks are usually senior. If, as has been argued (Fama (1990)), junior lenders have stronger incentives than senior lenders to monitor default risks, then we would expect monitoring specialists such as banks to be junior, not senior.

    "title": "Monitoring as a Motivation for IPO Underpricing",
    "abstract": "Brennan and Franks (1997) and Stoughton and Zechner (1998) provide contrast- ing arguments for why monitoring considerations create incentives for managers to underprice their firms’ IPOs (initial public offerings). Like Smart and Zutter (2003), we examine these arguments using a sample of U.S. IPOs. However, we find evidence that the determinants of initial returns, institutional shareholdings, and post-IPO likelihood of acquisition are not consistent with these arguments. Thus, we conclude that monitoring considerations are not important determinants of IPO underpricing. Evidence That THE Prices OF Unseasoned NEW Issues of common stock (IPOs) in early secondary market trading are substantially higher, on average, than their offer prices has evoked an extensive literature trying to explain such under- pricing. While prior literature has tended to focus on uncertainty/asymmetric information stories for such underpricing (e.g., Rock (1986) and Benveniste and Spindt (1989)), recent literature has suggested that post-IPO ownership con- siderations are also important. More specifically, this literature has suggested that monitoring considerations create incentives for managers to underprice their firm’s stock in its first public offering. Brennan and Franks (1997), for example, argue that insiders have an in- centive to underprice the IPO of their firm’s stock in order to ensure its wide distribution, thereby reducing the likelihood of being monitored or removed by new shareholde",

    "title": "Moral Hazard and Optimal Subsidiary",
    "abstract": "Banks and related financial institutions often have two separate subsidiaries that make loans of similar type but differing risk, for example, a bank and a finance com- pany, or a “good bank/bad bank” structure. Such “bipartite” structures may prevent risk shifting, in which banks misuse their flexibility in choosing and monitoring loans to exploit their debt holders. By “insulating” safer loans from riskier loans, a bipartite structure reduces risk-shifting incentives in the safer subsidiary. Bipartite structures are more likely to dominate unitary structures as the downside from riskier loans is higher or as expected profits from the efficient loan mix are lower. AT First Glance , Some Subsidiary Structures that are common among financial institutions seem difficult to explain. For example, bank holding companies, such as Wells Fargo Inc. And Bank of America, often have both a commercial banking subsidiary and a finance company subsidiary. Both subsidiaries make loans, and the sectors to which they lend usually overlap: both may lend to consumers, or both may lend to commercial firms. On average, finance com- pany loans are more risky than commercial bank loans, but outside investors generally cannot observe the risk of any given loan at the time it is made. Pub- lic disclosure by the holding company is usually limited to broad sectors (e.g., “commercial loans” or “consumer loans”), and in any case the holding company’s ex ante assessments of loan risk are in part subjectiv",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the role of moral hazard and liquidity in driving household bankruptcy . First, I estimate that increases in potential debt forgiveness have a pos- itive, but small, effect on ﬁling using a regression kink design. Second, exploiting quasi-experimental variation in mortgage payment reductions, I estimate that ﬁling is ﬁve times more responsive to cash-on-hand than relief generosity . Using a sufﬁ- cient statistic, I show the estimates imply large consumption-smoothing beneﬁts of bankruptcy for the marginal ﬁler. Finally , I conclude that 83% of the ﬁling response to dischargeable debt comes from liquidity effects rather than a moral hazard response to ﬁnancial incentives.

    "title": "More Than Words: Quantifying Language",
    "abstract": "We examine whether a simple quantitative measure of language can be used to predict individual firms’ accounting earnings and stock returns. Our three main findings are: (1) the fraction of negative words in firm-specific news stories forecasts low firm earnings; (2) firms’ stock prices briefly underreact to the information embedded in negative words; and (3) the earnings and return predictability from negative words is largest for the stories that focus on fundamentals. Together these findings suggest that linguistic media content captures otherwise hard-to-quantify aspects of firms’ fundamentals, which investors quickly incorporate into stock prices. Language is conceived in sin and science is its redemption —W. V.

Fama, the Robert McCormick Distinguished Service Professor of Finance at the University of Chicago, as the inaugural recipient of the Morgan Stanley—American Finance Association Award for Excellence in Finance. Eugene Fama’s first publication, “The Behavior of Stock-Market Prices,” was also his Ph.D. Dissertation at the University of Chicago. It appeared in the Journal of Business in January 1965 and studied the predictability of price changes. His most recent working paper, as of this writing, is “Dissecting Anomalies,” written with his frequent and long-time coauthor, Kenneth French. It studies the abnormal returns, measured relative to the Fama–French three- factor model, attributable to firm characteristics such as accruals, net stock issues, asset growth, and profitability. In the years separating these two papers, a great deal has happened in the field Eugene Fama helped to create, and throughout that time his contributions have been instrumental in shaping that evolution. In well over 100 published papers and two important books, Professor Fama has contributed to almost every subfield of finance.

    "title": "Mortgage Debt Overhang: Reduced Investment",
    "abstract": "Homeowners at risk of default face a debt overhang that reduces their incentive to invest in their property: in expectation, some value created by investments in the property will go to the lender. This agency conﬂict affects housing investments. Home- owners at risk of default cut back substantially on home improvements and mortgage principal payments, even when they appear ﬁnancially unconstrained. Meanwhile, they do not reduce spending on assets that they may retain in default, including home appliances, furniture, and vehicles. These ﬁndings highlight an important ﬁnancial friction that has stiﬂed housing investment since the Great Recession. A Longstanding AND Important IDEAin ﬁnance theory is that leverage can dis- tort investment decisions. Myers (1977) introduces the notion of corporate debt overhang, arguing that borrowing introduces an agency conﬂict that curtails productive investments. In public ﬁnance, Keynes (1920), Krugman (1988), and Sachs (1990) point out that heavy public debt loads reduce incentives for public sector investments in infrastructure and private sector investments in physical and human capital. This paper applies the same thinking to house- hold ﬁnancial decisions and provides evidence that homeowners reduce their housing investments when faced with mortgage debt overhang. The reasoning behind debt overhang is straightforward. For an incremental investment in a debt-free asset, the owner captures the investment’s payoffs Gene Amromin, Efraim Be",

    "title": "Mortgage Design in an Equilibrium Model of the",
    "abstract": "How can mortgages be redesigned to reduce macrovolatility and default? We address this question using a quantitative equilibrium life-cycle model. Designs with counter- cyclical payments outperform ﬁxed payments. Among those, designs that front-load payment reductions in recessions outperform those that spread relief over the full term. Front-loading alleviates liquidity constraints when they bind most, reducing default and stimulating housing demand. To illustrate, a ﬁxed-rate mortgage (FRM) with an option to convert to adjustable-rate mortgage, which front-loads payment re- ductions relative to an FRM with an option to reﬁnance underwater, reduces price and consumption declines six times as much and default three times as much. THE Design OF Mortgages IS Crucial to both household welfare and the macroeconomy . For most households, home equity is the largest component of wealth, and mortgages tend to be their dominant source of credit, so the de- sign of mortgages has an outsized effect on household balance sheets (Camp- bell (2013)). In the mid-2000s boom and subsequent bust, housing wealth extraction through the mortgage market boosted consumption in the boom and reduced consumption in the bust (e.g., Mian and Suﬁ (2011), Mian, Rao, and Suﬁ (2013)). Mortgage debt also led to the wave of foreclosures that re- sulted in over six million households losing their homes, badly damaging household balance sheets and crippling the housing market (e.g., Mian, Suﬁ, and Trebbi (2015),",

    "title": "Motivating Innovation",
    "abstract": "Motivating innovation is important in many incentive problems. This paper shows that the optimal innovation-motivating incentive scheme exhibits substantial toler- ance (or even reward) for early failure and reward for long-term success. Moreover, commitment to a long-term compensation plan, job security, and timely feedback on performance are essential to motivate innovation. In the context of managerial com- pensation, the optimal innovation-motivating incentive scheme can be implemented via a combination of stock options with long vesting periods, option repricing, golden parachutes, and managerial entrenchment. Berle AND MEANS’s (1932) seminal contribution brought to light the po- tential drawbacks associated with the separation of ownership and control. For example, in large corporations, shareholders delegate decision rights to a manager, who has the ability to manage resources to his own advantage. To alleviate possible conﬂicts of interest between shareholders and managers, incentive plans that align their interests are commonly used in practice. A large literature, which includes Harris and Raviv (1978) and Holmstrom (1979), studies this issue using principal-agent models. In these models, the principal offers the agent an incentive plan that induces the agent to act in the principal’s best interest. Most of the papers in this literature focus on the problems of inducing the agent to exert effort or deterring the agent from tunneling resources away from the corporati",

    "title": "Multimarket Trading and Liquidity:",
    "abstract": "We develop a new model of multimarket trading to explain the differences in the for- eign share of trading volume of internationally cross-listed stocks. The model predicts that the trading volume of a cross-listed stock is proportionally higher on the exchange in which the cross-listed asset returns have greater correlation with returns of other assets traded on that market. We find robust empirical support for this prediction using stock return and volume data on 251 non-U.S. Stocks cross-listed on major U.S. Exchanges. With THE Enhanced Globalization OF Financial Markets , the number of non-U.S. Firms choosing to cross-list shares on a U.S. Exchange has increased substan- tially. In 1990 there were only 352 non-U.S. Stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange (nyse) and Nasdaq, but by the end of 2002 the number had more than doubled to over 850. If one includes stocks trading over the counter (OTC) and as private placement issues, the number of non-U.S. Companies with shares trading in the United States now exceeds 2,300. This dramatic increase reflects not only U.S. Investors’ desire for international diversification, but also foreign companies’ desire to access global capital, broaden their shareholder base, and enhance company visibility. Corporations generally view U.S. Cross-listings as value-enhancing decisions, but there is disagreement about the sources of the benefit. 1 One of the benefits anonymous referee and the editor as well as seminar participants at the Un",

    "title": "Multiple versus Single Banking Relationships:",
    "abstract": "A theory of the optimal number of banking relationships is developed and tested using matched bank-firm data. According to the theory, relationship banks may be unable to continue funding profitable projects owing to internal problems and a firm may thus have to refinance from nonrelationship banks. The latter, however, face an adverse selection problem, as they do not know the quality of the project, and may refuse to lend. In these circumstances, multiple banking can reduce the probability of an early liquidation of the project. The empirical evidence supports the predictions of the model. Studies OF THE Corporate Financial Structure began by focusing on the choice between debt and equity (Harris and Raviv (1991)), and only recently have addressed the choice among alternative forms of debt, such as bank debt, public debt, privately placed debt, and others.' From this work a theory of bank-firm relationships has emerged, centered on the idea that banks ac- quire information about the quality of the firm that is not shared by other financial intermediaries.2 Much of this theory proceeds on the assumption Luigi Einaudi, respectively.

    "title": "Municipal Bond Liquidity and Default Risk",
    "abstract": "This paper examines the pricing of municipal bonds. I use three distinct, comple- mentary approaches to decompose municipal bond spreads into default and liquidity components, and ﬁnd that default risk accounts for 74% to 84% of the average spread after adjusting for tax-exempt status. The ﬁrst approach estimates the liquidity com- ponent using transaction data, the second measures the default component with credit default swap data, and the third is a quasi-natural experiment that estimates changes in default risk around pre-refunding events. The price of default risk is high given the rare incidence of municipal default and implies a high risk premium. Since THE Financial Crisis, the poor condition of local government ﬁnances has captured the attention of academics, legislators, and the popular press. Ris- ing retirement and healthcare costs are straining state and local government budgets. The post-crisis spate of defaults by cities and counties, including the bankruptcy ﬁling by Detroit in 2013, represents the most signiﬁcant default episode in the municipal bond market since the Great Depression.1 Based on recent events, it seems that municipal default risk is on the rise. However, a longer view reveals that defaults are extremely rare in the municipal bond market. The historical ﬁve-year cumulative default rate for all municipal bonds is 0.08% from 1970 to 2014, and the corresponding rate for general obligation bonds is 0.01% (Moody’s (2015)).

    "title": "Municipal Debt and Marginal Tax Rates: Is There",
    "abstract": "We study the marginal tax rate incorporated into short-term municipal rates using municipal swap market data. Using an afﬁne model, we identify the marginal tax rate and the credit/liquidity spread in 1-week tax-exempt rates, as well as their associated risk premia. The marginal tax rate averages 38.0% and is related to stock, bond, and commodity returns. The tax risk premium is negative, consistent with the strong countercyclical nature of after-tax ﬁxed-income cash ﬂows. These results demonstrate that tax risk is a systematic asset pricing factor and help resolve the muni-bond puzzle. ONE OF THE Most FUNDAMENTALissues in ﬁnancial economics is the question of how taxes affect security values. This important topic has been the focus of an extensive literature that now dates back nearly a century. Despite the many important contributions in this area, however, there is still much about the effects of taxation on investment values that is not yet fully understood. The challenge is particularly evident in studying municipal debt markets. Many researchers document that the ratio of municipal bond yields to Treasury or corporate bond yields appears to imply marginal tax rates that are much smaller than would be expected given federal income tax rates. This perplexing relation between taxable and tax-exempt yields is often termed the muni-bond puzzle.

    "abstract": "We investigate marginal compensation rates in mutual fund advisory contracts and find the following. Equity and foreign fund advisors receive higher marginal compensation than debt and domestic fund advisors. Advisors of funds with greater turnover receive higher marginal compensation. Also, closed-end fund advisors re- ceive higher marginal compensation than open-end fund advisors. Finally, we find that marginal compensation is lower for advisors of large funds and members of large fund families. We argue that these differences in marginal compensation reflect differences in advisor marginal product, differences in the difficulty of mon- itoring performance, differences in control environments, and scale economies. IN September 1998, the House Subcommittee on Finance and Hazardous Materials conducted hearings on the level of mutual fund fees and compe- tition in the mutual fund industry. The Securities and Exchange Commis- sion (SEC) followed those hearings with the SEC Roundtable on the Role of Independent Investment Company Directors in February 1999 where the role of directors in negotiating lower fees came under close examination. The level of mutual fund fees has also drawn the attention of the popular press with commentators suggesting that fund fees are excessive.'

    "abstract": "We develop a model of performance evaluation and fund ﬂows for mutual funds in a family. Family performance has two effects on a member fund’s estimated skill and inﬂows: a positive common-skill effect, and a negative correlated-noise effect. The overall spillover can be either positive or negative, depending on the weight of common skill and correlation of noise in returns. Its absolute value increases with family size, and declines over time. The sensitivity of ﬂows to a fund’s own performance is affected accordingly. Empirical estimates of fund ﬂow sensitivities show patterns consistent with rational cross-fund learning within families. With A Total OF$26.8 Trillion assets under management worldwide, mutual funds are a major player in ﬁnancial markets, and a primary investment ve- hicle for households in many countries. In the United States, the $13.0 billion mutual fund industry attracts 44.4% of households, among which 68% hold more than half of their ﬁnancial assets in mutual funds.1 As such, mutual fund investments have a signiﬁcant impact on the wealth of a large fraction of the population. They also indirectly affect the efﬁciencies of stock, bond, and money markets, by determining the allocation of assets across fund managers participating in those markets.

    "abstract": "This study analyzes the motivations for and consequences of funds’ credit default swap (CDS) investments using mutual funds’ quarterly holdings from pre- to postﬁ- nancial crisis. Funds invest in CDS when facing unpredictable liquidity needs. Funds sell more in reference entities when the CDS is liquid relative to the underlying bonds and buy more when the CDS-bond basis is more negative. To enhance yield, funds en- gage in negative basis trading and sell CDS with the highest spreads within rating categories, and with spreads higher than those of their bond portfolios. Funds with superior portfolio returns also demonstrate more skill in CDS trading. Credit Default Swaps (CDS) Grew from a small market in the early 2000s to a $62 trillion global market (in terms of notional amount) by 2007, the year prior to the ﬁnancial crisis (Jarrow ( 2011)). Despite the popularity of CDS as a synthetic security to gain or hedge credit exposure, there has been little users, employ and beneﬁt from CDS contracts. Not only do mutual funds act as both long- and short-term investors, but their trades arise from a variety of motives, including liquidity management, speculating on private information, and searching for yield.

    "title": "Mutual Fund Performance and the Incentive",
    "abstract": "To rationalize the well-known underperformance of the average actively managed mutual fund, we exploit the fact that retail funds in different market segments com- pete for different types of investors. Within the segment of funds marketed directly to retail investors, we show that ﬂows chase risk-adjusted returns, and that funds respond by investing more in active management. Importantly, within this direct-sold segment, we ﬁnd no evidence that actively managed funds underperform index funds. In contrast, we show that actively managed funds sold through brokers face a weaker incentive to generate alpha and signiﬁcantly underperform index funds. THE Typical Actively Managedu.s. Equity fund earns a negative after-fee al- pha (Gruber (1996), French (2008), Fama and French (2010), and others). This well-documented underperformance gives rise to two important and related questions. First, why do actively managed funds underperform? Second, given this underperformance, why are the vast majority of mutual fund assets still invested in actively managed funds? The widely accepted answer to the ﬁrst question is that efﬁcient U.S. Equity markets make it difﬁcult for U.S. Mutual fund managers to add value net of fees. The answer to the second question, however, is subject to debate. Gruber (1996), who ﬁrst highlighted this puzzle in his AFA presidential address, suggests that it might be driven by “disadvan- taged” investors who are either ignorant of the underperformance or behaving ir",

    "abstract": "We use a new database to perform a comprehensive analysis of the mutual fund industry. We find that funds hold stocks that outperform the market by 1.3 percent per year, but their net returns underperform by one percent. Of the 2.3 percent difference between these results, 0.7 percent is due to the underperformance of nonstock holdings, whereas 1.6 percent is due to expenses and transactions costs. Thus, funds pick stocks well enough to cover their costs. Also, high-turnover funds beat the Vanguard Index 500 fund on a net return basis. Our evidence supports the value of active mutual fund management. Do Mutual Fund Managers WHO actively trade stocks add value? Academics have debated this issue since the seminal paper of Jensen (1968). Although some controversy still exists, the majority of studies now conclude that ac- tively managed funds (e.g., the Fidelity Magellan fund), on average, under- perform their passively managed counterparts (e.g., the Vanguard Index 500 fund).1 For example, Gruber (1996) finds that the average mutual fund un- derperforms passive market indexes by about 65 basis points per year from some of the data used in this study.

    "abstract": "Mutual funds are held by investors in taxable and tax-qualiﬁed retirement accounts. We investigate whether the characteristics, investment strategies, and performance of mutual funds held by these diverse tax clienteles differ. Examining both mutual fund distributions and mutual fund holdings, we ﬁnd that funds held primarily by taxable investors choose investment strategies that result in lower tax burdens than funds held primarily in tax-qualiﬁed accounts. Despite these differences, we ﬁnd no evidence that any investment constraints that may arise from these tax-efﬁcient in- vestment strategies result in performance differences between funds held by different tax clienteles. TAX Consequences CAN BEan important aspect of many decisions by corporate managers. For example, taxes have an impact on a number of managerial decisions such as capital structure, investment, ﬁrm location, and payout policy. Substantial evidence also indicates that taxes affect many investor decisions, including security selection, mutual fund choice, and asset location decisions. For example,Bergstresser and Pontiff (2010)show that the choice of portfolio style can have economically signiﬁcant and widely varying effects on the after- tax returns to investors’ portfolios. Similarly, investors’ mutual fund returns can be affected by the tax consequences of managers’ investment choices.

    "title": "Mutual Fund Trading Pressure: Firm-Level Stock",
    "abstract": "We use price pressure resulting from purchases by mutual funds with large capital inﬂows to identify overvalued equity. This is a relatively exogenous overvaluation indicator as it is associated with who is buying—buyers with excess liquidity—rather than what is being purchased. We document substantial stock price impact associated with purchases by high-inﬂow mutual funds, and ﬁnd the probability of a seasoned equity offering (SEO), insider sales, and the probability of a stock-based acquisition increase signiﬁcantly in the four quarters following the mutual fund buying pressure. These results provide new evidence that ﬁrm managers are able to identify and exploit overvalued equity. Seasoned Equity Offerings (seos) have been widely studied in the litera- ture, with little emerging consensus on their determinants and economic con- sequences. Proposed determinants of SEOs include capital investments, reﬁ- nancing, liquidity squeezes, corporate control, stock market microstructure, and timing by managers with private information that their stock is overval- ued (Loughran and Ritter (1995, 1997), Graham and Harvey (2001), Baker and Wurgler (2002)). In this paper we propose a novel approach to testing the market-timing motive for SEOs, and provide evidence of SEO timing. The main empirical challenge in tests of SEO timing is identifying overvalued ﬁrms. Prior studies examining market timing typically use high market-to- book ratios or high past returns as identiﬁers of overvaluat",

For intraday halts that reopen after only a five-minute quotation period, inside quoted spreads more than double following halts and volatility increases to more than nine times normal levels. In contrast, halts that reopen the following day with a longer 90-minute quotation period are associated with insignificant spread effects and significantly dampened volatility effects. These results are con- sistent with the hypothesis that increased information transmission during the halt results in reduced posthalt uncertainty. THE USE OF Individual-security trading halts is common on both U.S. And international stock exchanges. However, the costs and benefits of trading halts are widely debated. Proponents argue that halts allow investors time to react to material news events and allow market makers to search for a new price level. Detractors argue that halts are an unnecessary barrier to trading and point to empirical studies that find unusually high levels of volatility following halts.

We ﬁnd NBD in purchases of multiple stocks, and in mixed purchases of individual stocks and funds. In contrast, there is little evidence of NPD. Evidence suggests that NBD arises due to stock picking behavior and neglect of diversiﬁcation. These ﬁndings suggest that behavioral ﬁnance theory should incorporate transaction, as well as portfolio, framing.

We identify conditions where the court should some- times err in determining which firms should be liquidated. Such errors affect actions by both good and bad entrepreneurs. We first characterize the optimal error rate without renegotiation. When creditors and debtors can renegotiate to circumvent an error-riven court, for one class of actions a blind court that ignores all information is optimal. For another class, the court should place the burden of proof on the en- trepreneur. The robust feature is that the court should sometimes err.

It is often unclear whether it is socially op- timal for a bankrupt firm to be reorganized as a continuing entity, or whether it should be liquidated and the proceeds from liquidation distributed. If creditors and debtors cannot reach a settlement, then the bankruptcy court may impose one. This paper asks the following questions: Is it always optimal for the court to make the “right” decision? If liquidation is efficient, should the court always mandate liquidation? If the bankrupt firm could be a profitable entity, should the court always allow it to restructure under the existing management and continue? Or is it optimal for the court to sometimes make mistakes? How does the possibility of negotiated settlements aff",

    "abstract": "We obtain exact necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for existence and uniqueness of solutions of a class of homothetic recursive utility models postulated by Epstein and tion. The test sheds light on the relationship between valuation of cash ﬂows, impa- tience, risk adjustment, and intertemporal substitution of consumption. We propose two methods to compute the test value when an analytical solution is not available. We further provide several applications. Recursive Preference Models Such AS those discussed in Koopmans (1960), Epstein and Zin (1989), and Weil (1990) play an important role in macroeco- nomic and ﬁnancial modeling. For example, the long-run risk models analyzed in Bansal and Yaron (2004), Hansen, Heaton, and Li (2008), Bansal, Kiku, and Yaron (2012), and Schorfheide, Song, and Yaron (2018) employ such prefer- ences in discrete-time inﬁnite-horizon settings with a variety of consumption path speciﬁcations to help resolve long-standing empirical puzzles identiﬁed in the literature. In recursive utility models, the lifetime value of a consumption stream from a given point in time is expressed as the solution to a nonlinear forward-looking equation. While this representation is convenient and intuitive, it can also be vacuous, in the sense that no ﬁnite solution to the forward-looking recursion exists. Moreover, even when a solution is found, this solution lacks predictive content unless some form of uniqueness can also be established. In general, The authors than",

Insurance companies, especially life insurers and insurers with low reg- ulatory capital ratios, are more exposed to textual risks. Consistent with issuers hedging litigation risks with disclosure, we ﬁnd that textual contents are associated with second-lien underreporting and preissuance written communications. Overall, we ﬁnd that investors neglected risks in the purportedly safe assets before the crisis. THE Great Financial Crisis (GFC) has taught us many lessons.

    "abstract": "This paper establishes a causal relation between an individual’s decision whether to own stocks and average stock market participation of the individual’s community. We instrument for the average ownership of an individual’s community with lagged average ownership of the states in which one’s nonnative neighbors were born. Com- bining this instrumental variables approach with controls for individual and com- munity fixed effects, a broad set of time-varying individual and community controls, and state-year effects rules out alternative explanations. To further establish that word-of-mouth communication drives this causal effect, we show that the results are stronger in more sociable communities. Standard Models OF Portfolio Choice typically assume that fully informed in- vestors make rational asset allocation decisions to maximize lifetime utility. As Ellison and Fudenberg (1995 P. 93) note, however, “economic agents must often make decisions without knowing the costs and benefits of the possible choices” and thus often “rely on whatever information they have obtained via causal word-of-mouth communication.” Given the evidence that average U.S. Citizens have limited investment knowledge, 1 might individuals make portfolio choice decisions based on what they have learned from social interactions?

    "abstract": "We examine whether strong networks among incumbent venture capitalists (VCs) in local markets help restrict entry by outside VCs, thus improving incumbents’ bargaining power over entrepreneurs. More densely networked markets experience less entry, with a one-standard deviation increase in network ties among incumbents reducing entry by approximately one-third. Entrants with established ties to target- market incumbents appear able to overcome this barrier to entry; in turn, incumbents react strategically to an increased threat of entry by freezing out any incumbents who facilitate entry into their market. Incumbents appear to beneﬁt from reduced entry by paying lower prices for their deals. Entrepreneurship AND Innovation are commonly considered key determinants of an economy’s capacity for wealth creation, job growth, and competitiveness. Venture capitalists (VCs) serve a vital economic function by identifying, fund- ing, and nurturing promising entrepreneurs, though whether they provide cap- ital and services on competitive terms is much debated. In this paper, we exam- ine whether U.S. Venture capital ﬁrms engage in practices designed to increase their bargaining power over entrepreneurs by restricting entry into local VC markets, such as Silicon Valley in California or Route 128 in Massachusetts.

    "abstract": "In this paper, I examine asset pricing in a multisector model with sectors connected through an input-output network. Changes in the network are sources of systematic risk reﬂected in equilibrium asset prices. Two characteristics of the network matter for asset prices: network concentration and network sparsity. These two production-based asset pricing factors are determined by the structure of the network and are computed from input-output data. Consistent with the model predictions, I ﬁnd return spreads of 4.6% and −3.2% per year on sparsity and concentration beta-sorted portfolios, respectively. Firms USE A Variety OF inputs to build their products, collectively spending trillions of dollars and designing a network of input-output linkages. As tech- nology evolves, industries use different inputs to produce their products. For example, since the 1970s, plastics have become a more suitable substitute for wood and metal materials, reshaping the production process for manufactur- ing and construction. Changes in the input-output network have implications for the overall economy as they alter sectoral input-output linkages.

    "abstract": "This paper examines the impact of a major change in dividend taxation introduced in the United Kingdom in July 1997. The reform was structured in such a way that the immediate impact fell almost entirely on the largest investor class in the United Kingdom, namely pension funds. We find significant changes in the valuation of dividend income after the reform, in particular for high-yielding companies. These results provide strong support for the hypothesis that taxation affects the valua- tion of companies, and that pension funds were the effective marginal investors for high-yielding companies. IT IS Very Rare FOR Governments to design their tax changes in a way that allows clean tests of important hypotheses. However, in July 1997, the in- coming Labour government in the United Kingdom radically reformed the taxation of dividend income in such a way that the immediate impact fell almost entirely upon one important class of investors, namely pension funds. As is well known, pension funds are the single biggest class of investors in U.K. Equities. It was estimated, in 1997, that over one third of U.K. Equities were held by pension funds, and the impact of the tax change was to in- crease the taxation of dividend income by ?5bn ($7.5 bn) per annum. We use this major tax change to examine two questions: Is there evidence that pen- sion funds are the \"marginal\" investors in the United Kingdom, and, if so, how do taxes affect the valuation of dividend income?

    "abstract": "We examine the relation between a board's decision to reject antitakeover pro- visions of Pennsylvania Senate Bill 1310 and subsequent labor market oppor- tunities of those same board members. Compared to directors retaining all provisions, directors rejecting all protective provisions of SB1310 are three times as likely to gain additional external directorships and are 30 percent more likely to retain their internal slot on the board of that same Pennsylvania company. For external board seats, the results are driven by nonexecutive di- rectors who are not members of the management team; for internal board seats, the results are driven by executive directors. Labor Market Discipline-by Means of ex post settling up -can motivate managers and directors to act in the interests of the shareholders of the firms they serve (e.g., Fama and Jensen (1983)). If the labor market, either internal to the firm or externally, provides opportunities that managers and directors care about, and the availability of those opportunities is sensitive to \"on-the-job\" performance, then the incentives of managers and directors will be aligned, at least somewhat, with shareholder interests. On the other hand, if performance has little connec- tion to future opportunities, then the incentive effects of the labor market are minimal and shareholders must rely on other mechanisms to align the incentives of managers and directors with shareholder interests.

    "abstract": "This paper models components of the return distribution, which are assumed to be directed by a latent news process. The conditional variance of returns is a combination of jumps and smoothly changing components. A heterogeneous Poisson process with a time-varying conditional intensity parameter governs the likelihood of jumps. Unlike typical jump models with stochastic volatility, previous realizations of both jump and normal innovations can feed back asymmetrically into expected volatility. This model improves forecasts of volatility, particularly after large changes in stock returns. We provide empirical evidence of the impact and feedback effects of jump versus normal return innovations, leverage effects, and the time-series dynamics of jump clustering. There IS A Wide -spread Perception in the financial press that volatility of asset returns has been changing. The new economy is introducing more uncertainty. Indeed, it can be argued that volatility is being transferred from the economy at large into the financial markets, which bear the necessary adjustment shocks. Given the impact of changes in volatility dynamics on many important finan- cial and economic decisions (such as portfolio rebalancing, derivative pricing, risk measurement, and risk management), it is important to assess the empiri- cal validity of this perception and to investigate the sources and characteristics of changing volatility dynamics. Volatility 2 and risk can be linked to the quantity and quality",

    "abstract": "We compare the optimal trading strategy of an informed speculator when he can trade ahead of incoming news (is “fast”), versus when he cannot (is “slow”). We ﬁnd that speed matters: the fast speculator’s trades account for a larger fraction of trad- ing volume, and are more correlated with short-run price changes. Nevertheless, he realizes a large fraction of his proﬁts from trading on long-term price changes. The fast speculator’s behavior matches evidence about high-frequency traders. We predict that stocks with more informative news are more liquid even though they attract more activity from informed high-frequency traders. High-frequency traders do not care if information is accurate or inaccurate. They just want to know what is coming out on the market that might sway public sentiment.

    "title": "No Contagion, Only Interdependence: Measuring Stock Market Comovements",
    "abstract": "Heteroskedasticity biases tests for contagion based on correlation coefficients. When contagion is defined as a significant increase in market comovement after a shock to one country, previous work suggests contagion occurred during recent crises. This paper shows that correlation coefficients are conditional on market volatility. Under certain assumptions, it is possible to adjust for this bias. Using this adjust- ment, there was virtually no increase in unconditional correlation coefficients (i.e., no contagion) during the 1997 Asian crisis, 1994 Mexican devaluation, and 1987 U.S. Market crash. There is a high level of market comovement in all periods, however, which we call interdependence. IN October 1997, THE Hong Kong Stock Market declined sharply and then partially rebounded. As shown in Figure 1, this movement affected markets in North and South America, Europe, and Africa. In December 1994, the Mexican market dropped significantly, and as shown in Figure 2, this fall was quickly reflected in other Latin American markets. Figure 3 shows that in October 1987, the U.S. Market crash affected major stock markets around the world. These cases show that dramatic movements in one stock market can have a powerful impact on markets of very different sizes and structures across the globe. Do these periods of highly correlated stock market move- ments provide evidence of contagion? Before answering this question, it is necessary to define contagion. There is widespread disagreem",

    "abstract": "We study how employment documentation requirements and out-of-pocket closing costs constrain mortgage reﬁnancing. These frictions, which bind most severely dur- ing recessions, may signiﬁcantly inhibit monetary policy pass-through. To study their effects on reﬁnancing, we exploit a Federal Housing Administration policy change that excluded unemployed borrowers from reﬁnancing and increased others’ out-of- pocket costs substantially. These changes dramatically reduced reﬁnancing rates, particularly among the likely unemployed and those facing new out-of-pocket costs. Our results imply that unemployed and liquidity-constrained borrowers have a high latent demand for reﬁnancing. Cyclical variation in these factors may therefore affect both the aggregate and distributional consequences of monetary policy. Frictions That Prevent Households From reﬁnancing their debt during times of economic distress can signiﬁcantly inhibit policy efforts aimed at cur- tailing the costs of recessions. This was particularly true during the Great Re- cession, when frictions in the U.S. Mortgage market held back a broad array of policies directed at providing debt relief and economic stimulus to households.

    "title": "Noise Trading, Costly Arbitrage,",
    "abstract": "If arbitrage is costly and noise traders are active, asset prices may deviate from fundamental values for long periods of time. We use a sample of 158 closed-end funds to show that noise-trader sentiment, as proxied by retail-investor flows, leads to fluctuations in the discount. Nevertheless, we reject the hypothesis that noise- trader risk is the cause of the long-run discount. Instead we find that funds which are more difficult to arbitrage have larger discounts, due to: (1) the censoring of the discount by the arbitrage bounds, and (2) the freedom of managers to increase charges when arbitrage is costly. Delong ET AL. (1990) Describe a market as a contest between arbitrageurs, whose expectations are rational, and noise traders, whose expectations are based on sentiment. Not only does an arbitrageur have to manage the fun- damental risk on a position, but he or she also bears \"the risk that noise traders' beliefs will not revert to their mean for a long time and might in the meantime become even more extreme\" (DeLong et al., p. 704). The result is that the price of an asset may fluctuate in a band around fundamental value, the width of the band depending on the cost of arbitrage and the number of noise traders. Furthermore, if noise-trader risk is systematic (rather than idiosyncratic), it will need to be rewarded and the asset price will trade at a discount to fundamental value.

    "title": "Noise as Information for Illiquidity",
    "abstract": "We propose a market-wide liquidity measure by exploiting the connection between the amount of arbitrage capital in the market and observed “noise” in U.S. Treasury bonds—the shortage of arbitrage capital allows yields to deviate more freely from the curve, resulting in more noise in prices. Our noise measure captures episodes of liquidity crises of different origins across the ﬁnancial market, providing information beyond existing liquidity proxies. Moreover, as a priced risk factor, it helps to explain cross-sectional returns on hedge funds and currency carry trades, both known to be sensitive to the general liquidity conditions of the market. THE Level OF Liquidity in the aggregate ﬁnancial market is closely connected to the amount of arbitrage capital available. During normal times, institutional investors such as investment banks and hedge funds have abundant capital, which they can deploy to supply liquidity. Consequently, big price deviations from fundamental values are largely eliminated by arbitrage forces, and assets are traded at prices closer to their fundamental values. During market crises, however, capital becomes scarce and/or willingness to deploy it diminishes, and liquidity in the overall market dries up. The lack of sufﬁcient arbitrage capital limits arbitrage forces and assets can be traded at prices signiﬁcantly away from their fundamental values. 1 Thus, temporary price deviations, or noise in prices, being a key symptom of shortage in arbitrage capital,",

We consider a number of corrections, and show them to be effective under reasonable assumptions.

The bias can be large in economic terms, for example, equal to 50% or more of the corrected estimate for ﬁrm size and share price. Invoke comparisons of mean rates of return across securities and portfolios. Such comparisons lie at the heart of the vast empirical asset pricing literature, and are central to the estimation of ﬁrms’ cost of capital. Beyond formal asset pricing tests, researchers have assessed relations between mean returns and a diverse array of ﬁrm attributes, such as the quality of corporate governance (Gompers, Ishii, and Metrick (2003)), aggregate short selling and institutional ownership (e.g., Asquith, Pathak, and Ritter (2005)), media coverage (Fang and Peress (2009)), success of customer ﬁrms (Cohen and Frazzini (2008)), and credit ratings (Avramov et al.

    "title": "Nonbinding Voting for Shareholder Proposals",
    "abstract": "Shareholder proposals are a common form of shareholder activism. Voting for share- holder proposals, however, is nonbinding since management has the authority to reject the proposal even if it received majority support from shareholders. We analyze whether nonbinding voting is an effective mechanism for conveying shareholder ex- pectations. We show that, unlike binding voting, nonbinding voting generally fails to convey shareholder views when manager and shareholder interests are not aligned. Surprisingly, the presence of an activist investor who can discipline the manager may enhance the advisory role of nonbinding voting only if conﬂicts of interest between shareholders and the activist are substantial. According TO Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 14a-8, share- holders of a public company are permitted to submit a proposal to be voted on at the annual shareholder meeting. Unlike voting for management-initiated proposals, the resolutions of votes on shareholder-initiated proposals are non- binding in the following sense: the company’s board can make its own determi- nation as to whether adoption of all or any part of a shareholder proposal is in the company’s best interest, even if the proposal received substantial majority support from shareholders. 1,2 Nonbinding shareholder proposals have become increasingly common in re- cent years, especially in the post-Enron era.

    "abstract": "We investigate a novel determinant of ﬁnancial distress, namely, individuals’ self- efﬁcacy, or belief that their actions can inﬂuence the future. Individuals with high self-efﬁcacy are more likely to take precautions that mitigate adverse ﬁnancial shocks. They are subsequently less likely to default on their debt and bill payments, especially after experiencing negative shocks such as job loss or illness. Thus, noncognitive abil- ities are an important determinant of ﬁnancial fragility and subjective expectations are an important factor in household ﬁnancial decisions. Financial Decisions Require INDIVIDUALSto consider intertemporal trade-offs in an uncertain environment. For example, a prospective saver evaluates whether the expected beneﬁts of precautionary savings outweigh the cost of reducing consumption today. A borrower struggling to repay a loan compares the poten- tial beneﬁts of avoiding default to the costs of reducing spending or getting a second job today to avoid default. Or a middle-aged couple evaluates whether insuring their long-term care is worthwhile at the expense of the insurance premium. In each of these choices, the agent considers a trade-off involving an action that is costly today and has an uncertain effect on the distribution of future outcomes. Therefore, individuals’ subjective perception of this trade-off is likely to inﬂuence their decisions. Building on this idea, we examine the effect of subjective beliefs on ﬁnan- cial behavior.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates nonlinear pricing kernels in which the risk factor is en- dogenously determined and preferences restrict the definition of the pricing ker- nel. These kernels potentially generate the empirical performance of nonlinear and multifactor models, while maintaining empirical power and avoiding ad hoc spec- ifications of factors or functional form. Our test results indicate that preference- restricted nonlinear pricing kernels are both admissible for the cross section of returns and are able to significantly improve upon linear single- and multifactor kernels. Further, the nonlinearities in the pricing kernel drive out the importance of the factors in the linear multi-factor model. A Principal Implication OF THE Capital Asset Pricing Model (capm) is that the pricing kernel is linear in a single factor, the portfolio of aggregate wealth. Numerous studies over the past two decades have documented violations of this restriction.1 In response, researchers have examined the performance of alternative models of asset prices. These models have generally fallen into two classes: (1) multifactor models such as Ross' APT or Merton's Icapm, in which factors in addition to the market return determine asset prices; or (2) nonparametric models, such as Bansal et al.

    "title": "Nonlinearity and Flight-to-Safety in the",
    "abstract": "We document a highly signiﬁcant, strongly nonlinear dependence of stock and bond returns on past equity market volatility as measured by the VIX. We propose a new estimator for the shape of the nonlinear forecasting relationship that exploits variation in the cross-section of returns. The nonlinearities are mirror images for stocks and bonds, revealing ﬂight-to-safety: expected returns increase for stocks when volatility increases from moderate to high levels while they decline for Treasuries. These ﬁndings provide support for dynamic asset pricing theories in which the price of risk is a nonlinear function of market volatility. Investor Flight-to-safety IS pervasive in times of elevated risk (Longstaff (2004), Beber, Brandt, and Kavajecz (2009), Baele et al. (2013)). Economic theories of investor ﬂight-to-safety predict highly nonlinear asset pricing rela- tionships (Vayanos (2004), Weill (2007), Caballero and Krishnamurthy (2008), Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2009)). Such nonlinear pricing relationships are difﬁcult to document empirically as the particular shape of the nonlinearity is model-speciﬁc, and inference of nonlinear relationships presents economet- ric challenges. In this paper, we document an economically and statistically strong nonlin- ear risk-return trade-off by estimating the relationship between stock market volatility as measured by the VIX and future returns. The nonlinear risk-return trade-off features evidence of ﬂight-to-safety from stocks to bonds in t",

    "abstract": "I demonstrate that nonﬁnancial corporations act as cross-market arbitrageurs in their own securities. Firms use one type of security to replace another in response to shifts in relative valuations, inducing negatively correlated ﬁnancing ﬂows in dif- ferent markets. Net equity repurchases and net debt issuance both increase when expected excess returns on debt are particularly low, or when expected excess returns on equity are relatively high. Credit valuations affect equity ﬁnancing as much as eq- uity valuations do, and vice versa. Cross-market corporate arbitrage is most prevalent among large, unconstrained ﬁrms, and helps account for aggregate ﬁnancing patterns. IT IS Well Known THATﬁrms time capital markets to issue and repurchase se- curities. In particular, prior studies show that ﬁnancing activities in a given market respond strongly to valuation conditions in that market: ﬁrms issue more stock, for instance, when equity valuations are high, while they repur- chase more stock when equity valuations are low (Ritter (1991), Baker and Wurgler (2000), Hong, Wang, and Yu (2008)).1 In this paper, I demonstrate that nonﬁnancial ﬁrms in the United States act focuses mostly on a single asset class, ﬁrms issue securities in several different capital markets, each of which may experience distinct pricing ﬂuctuations. I show that ﬁrms do not time a given market in isolation. Rather, they jointly time multiple markets and engage in cross-market arbitrage, replacing one type of sec",

    "title": "Offering versus Choice in 401(k) Plans: Equity Exposure and Number of Funds",
    "abstract": "Records of over half a million participants in more than 600 401(k) plans indicate that participants tend to allocate their contributions evenly across the funds they use, with the tendency weakening with the number of funds used. The number of funds used, typically between three and four, is not sensitive to the number of funds offered by the plans, which ranges from 4 to 59. A participant’s propensity to allocate contributions to equity funds is not very sensitive to the fraction of equity funds among offered funds. The paper also comments on limitations on inferences from experiments and aggregate-level data analysis. HOW Much AND HOW TO Save FOR Retirement is one of the most important financial decisions made by most people. Defined contribution (DC) pension plans, such as the popular 401(k) plans, are important instruments of such savings. By 2001 year-end, about 45 million American employees held 401(k) plan accounts with a total of $1.75 trillion in assets (Holden and VanDerhei (2001)). An important characteristic of these plans is that the participant has responsibility over his savings among a plan’s various funds. How responsibly do the participants be- have? In particular, how sensitive are participants’ choices to possible framing effects associated with the menu of choices they are offered? To explore these questions, this paper analyzes a data set recently provided by the Vanguard Group consisting of records of more than half a million par- ticipants in about 64",

    "title": "Oil Futures Prices in a Production Economy with",
    "abstract": "We document a new stylized fact, that the relationship between the volatility of oil futures prices and the slope of the forward curve is nonmonotone and has a V-shape. This pattern cannot be generated by standard models that emphasize storage. We develop an equilibrium model of oil production in which investment is irreversible and capacity constrained. Investment constraints affect firms’ investment decisions and imply that the supply elasticity changes over time. Since demand shocks must be absorbed by changes in prices or changes in supply, time-varying supply elasticity results in time-varying volatility of futures prices. Estimating this model, we show it is quantitatively consistent with the V-shape relationship between the volatility of futures prices and the slope of the forward curve. IN Recent Years Commodity Markets have experienced dramatic growth in trad- ing volume, the variety of contracts, and the range of underlying commodities. There also has been a great demand for derivative instruments utilizing opera- tional contingencies embedded in delivery contracts. For all these reasons there is widespread interest in models for pricing and hedging commodity-linked con- tingent claims. Commodities offer a rich variety of empirical properties that make them strikingly different from stocks, bonds, and other conventional fi- nancial assets. Notable properties of commodity futures include: (i) commod- ity futures prices are often “backwardated” in that they decline wi",

He then studied mathematics at Cambridge before turning to eco- nomics at a time when a number of others were doing the same. The transition took place at Warwick University, where Hart spent one year learning basic economics and the second doing a master’s degree. From there he went to Princeton (after some useful lobbying from one of his Warwick professors, John Williamson), where he did a PhD. At Princeton he met his future wife, Rita Goldberg, with whom he later had two sons, Daniel and Benjamin. He also learned at Princeton that mathematical economics was not the only economics ﬁeld to which mathematics could be applied; there was something called eco- nomic theory. Michael Rothschild, who had recently moved from Harvard to be a professor at Princeton, was a crucial inﬂuence here. While at Princeton, Hart became interested in the idea of a stock market economy and more generally incomplete markets. At some point he realized that standard (constrained) optimality arguments do not apply to incomplete market economies with more than one good or more than two periods.

    "title": "On Enhancing Shareholder Control: A (Dodd-)",
    "abstract": "We use events related to a proxy access rule passed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2010 as natural experiments to study the valuation effects of changes in shareholder control. We ﬁnd that valuations increase (decrease) following increases (decreases) in perceived control, especially for ﬁrms that are poorly performing, have shareholders likely to exercise control, and where acquiring a stake is relatively inex- pensive. These results suggest that an increase in shareholder control from its current level would generally beneﬁt shareholders. However, we ﬁnd that the beneﬁts of in- creased control are muted for ﬁrms with shareholders whose interests may deviate from value maximization. A Central Issue IN Corporate ﬁnance is the optimal division of control be- tween shareholders and management. In the ongoing debate over the need for better protection of shareholder rights, a key question is whether an increase in shareholder control would beneﬁt shareholders. Theory offers little guid- ance, suggesting that more shareholder control could have positive or negative effects on shareholder wealth (e.g., Harris and Raviv (2010)). Thus, whether more shareholder control would beneﬁt shareholders is ultimately an empirical question. This is a challenging question to answer, as exogenous variation in share- holder control is difﬁcult to identify. We attempt to answer this question by studying the market’s response to events related to the evolution of the Securities and Ex",

    "title": "On the Asset Allocation of a Default",
    "abstract": "We characterize the optimal default fund in a deﬁned contribution (DC) pension plan. Using detailed data on individuals’ holdings inside and outside the pension system, we ﬁnd substantial heterogeneity within and between passive and active investors in terms of labor income, ﬁnancial wealth, and stock market participation. We build a life-cycle consumption-savings model, with a DC pension account and an opt-out/default choice, that produces realistic investor heterogeneity. Relative to a common age-based allocation, implementing the optimal default asset allocation implies a welfare gain of 1.5% during retirement. Much of the gain is attainable with a simple rule of thumb. THE Worldwide Shift From DEFINEDbeneﬁt (DB) to deﬁned contribution (DC) pension plans challenges pension investors, who have been given greater re- sponsibility to choose their contribution rates and manage their asset alloca- tions. Many investors seem uninterested, display inertia (Madrian and Shea (2001)), or lack ﬁnancial literacy (Lusardi and Mitchell (2014)), ending up in the default option. Consequently, the design of the default option in a pension plan may be a powerful tool for improving investment outcomes.1 was circulated under the title “On the Design of a Default Pension Fund.” We have beneﬁted from the comments of John Campbell, Christopher Carroll, Jo˜ao Cocco, Pierre Collin-Dufresne, Anthony Cookson, Frank de Jong, Francisco Gomes, Michael Haliassos, John Hassler, Harrison Hong, Seoy- oung",

    "title": "On the Benefits of Concurrent Lending",
    "abstract": "This paper examines whether there are efficiencies that benefit issuers and under- writers when a financial intermediary concurrently lends to an issuer while also un- derwriting its public securities offering. We find issuers, particularly noninvestment- grade issuers for whom informational economies of scope are likely to be large, benefit through lower underwriter fees and discounted loan yield spreads. Underwriters, both commercial banks as well as investment banks, engage in concurrent lending and provide price discounts, albeit in different ways. We find concurrent lending helps underwriters build relationships, increasing the probability of receiving current and future business. FOR Many Years, THE 1933 Glass-steagall ACT prevented commercial banks from underwriting corporate bonds and equities. Due to the relaxation and recent repeal of the Act, many commercial banks have acquired investment banks or developed investment banking capabilities internally to create universal banks that can offer an array of financial services. The entry of commercial banks into underwriting markets has increased the potential for financial institutions to offer both lending and underwriting ser- vices. In particular, it has become increasingly common for financial intermedi- aries to provide loans to a firm while also underwriting the firm’s public securi- ties. In fact, concurrent lending and underwriting has increased substantially over time—in 1994, only 1% of seasoned equity issuers",

    "title": "On the Design of Contingent Capital with",
    "abstract": "Contingent capital (CC), which aims to internalize the costs of too-big-to-fail in the capital structure of large banks, has been under intense debate by policy makers and academics. We show that CC with a market trigger, in which direct stakeholders are unable to choose optimal conversion policies, does not lead to a unique competitive equilibrium unless value transfer at conversion is not expected ex ante. The “no value transfer” restriction precludes penalizing bank managers for taking excessive risk. Multiplicity or absence of equilibrium introduces the potential for price uncertainty, market manipulation, inefﬁcient capital allocation, and frequent conversion errors. ONE OF THE Lessons learned from the ﬁnancial crisis of 2007 to 2009 is that the capital structure and ﬁnancial insolvency procedures of banks and ﬁnancial institutions need a major overhaul. The bailout of Bear Stearns and AIG, the public assistance to Citigroup and Bank of America, and the freeze of the ﬁnancial system after Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy have demonstrated the need to revisit ﬁnancial insolvency procedures. In particular, the extensive amount of implicit guarantees, outright infusion of taxpayer money, and other beneﬁts extended to large ﬁnancial institutions have come under scrutiny. Recognizing these lessons, the U.S. Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act 1 and the Basel Committee moved to strengthen bank regulation with Basel conference participants in the NY Fed Workshop on Contingent Capital",

    "abstract": "Using corporate social responsibility (CSR) ratings for 23,000 companies from 114 countries, we ﬁnd that a ﬁrm’s CSR rating and its country’s legal origin are strongly correlated. Legal origin is a stronger explanation than “doing good by doing well” factors or ﬁrm and country characteristics (ownership concentration, political insti- tutions, and globalization): ﬁrms from common law countries have lower CSR than companies from civil law countries, with Scandinavian civil law ﬁrms having the highest CSR ratings. Evidence from quasi-natural experiments such as scandals and natural disasters suggests that civil law ﬁrms are more responsive to CSR shocks than common law ﬁrms. THE Classical View IN Finance on modern corporations takes a shareholder value maximization perspective, which holds that corporations are account- able only to proﬁt-maximizing shareholders, and apart from their contractu- ally determined obligations, have no responsibility to serve other stakehold- ers’ interests or to enhance society’s welfare (Friedman (1970), B´enabou and Tirole (2010)).

    "abstract": "We propose a new method to model hedge fund risk exposures using relatively high- frequency conditioning variables. In a large sample of funds, we ﬁnd substantial evidence that hedge fund risk exposures vary across and within months, and that capturing within-month variation is more important for hedge funds than for mutual funds. We consider different within-month functional forms, and uncover patterns such as day-of-the-month variation in risk exposures. We also ﬁnd that changes in portfolio allocations, rather than in the risk exposures of the underlying assets, are the main drivers of hedge funds’ risk exposure variation. AN Important Feature OFhedge funds is the speed with which they alter their investments in response to changing market conditions. Static analyses of hedge funds’ risk exposures are likely to miss these rapid changes in their strategies or leverage ratios, and thus several new approaches have been pro- posed to model the dynamics of these risk exposures.1 One factor that must be taken into consideration is the high frequency (often daily or even higher) with which hedge fund risk exposures change.2 However, the approaches pro- posed thus far to model dynamic risk exposures track such changes only at the monthly frequency, as this is the reporting frequency for performance data in all of the main hedge fund databases. We propose a new method to surmount this obstacle, and to better understand the high-frequency dynamics of hedge fund risk exposures. The s",

    "title": "On the Importance of Measuring Payout Yield:",
    "abstract": "We investigate the empirical implications of using various measures of payout yield rather than dividend yield for asset pricing models. We find statistically and eco- nomically significant predictability in the time series when payout (dividends plus repurchases) and net payout (dividends plus repurchases minus issuances) yields are used instead of the dividend yield. Similarly, we find that payout (net payout) yields contains information about the cross section of expected stock returns exceeding that of dividend yields, and that the high minus low payout yield portfolio is a priced factor. While THE Irrelevance Theorem of Miller and Modigliani (1961) implies that there is no reason to suspect that dividends play a role in determining equity price levels or equity returns, the theorem is silent on the usefulness of div- idends in explaining these variables. It is then, perhaps, not surprising that there is a considerable literature exploiting the properties of dividends and dividend yields to better understand the fundamentals of asset pricing both in the time series and in the cross section. Motivation for the former comes from variations of the Gordon growth model in which dividend yields can be written as the return minus the dividend’s growth rate (see, e.g., Fama and French (1988)), from consumption-based asset pricing models in which the firm’s dividends covary with aggregate consumption (e.g., Lucas (1978) and Shiller (1981)), and so forth.

    "abstract": "Mutual fund managers may decide to deviate from a well-diversified portfolio and con- centrate their holdings in industries where they have informational advantages. In this paper, we study the relation between the industry concentration and the perfor- mance of actively managed U.S. Mutual funds from 1984 to 1999. Our results indicate that, on average, more concentrated funds perform better after controlling for risk and style differences using various performance measures. This finding suggests that investment ability is more evident among managers who hold portfolios concentrated in a few industries. Actively Managed Mutual Funds are an important constituent of the financial sector. Despite the well-documented evidence that, on average, actively man- aged funds underperform passive benchmarks, mutual fund managers might still differ substantially in their investment abilities. 1 In this paper, we exam- ine whether some fund managers create value by concentrating their portfolios in industries where they have informational advantages. Conventional wisdom suggests that investors should widely diversify their holdings across industries to reduce their portfolios’ idiosyncratic risk.

    "abstract": "We use data over 25 years to understand the life cycle dynamics of VC- and non-VC- ﬁnanced ﬁrms. We ﬁnd successful and failed VC-ﬁnanced ﬁrms achieve larger scale but are not more proﬁtable at exit than matched non-VC-ﬁnanced ﬁrms. Cumulative failure rates of VC-ﬁnanced ﬁrms are lower, with the difference driven largely by lower failure rates in the initial years after receiving VC. Our results are not driven by VCs disguising failures as acquisitions or by certain types of VCs. The performance difference between VC- and non-VC-ﬁnanced ﬁrms narrows in the post-internet bub- ble years, but does not disappear. THE Venture Capital (VC) industry has grown dramatically over the past 30 years. In 1980 the total amount of money newly invested by venture capital- ists in the U.S. Was estimated at $610 million, according to ﬁgures published by PricewaterhouseCoopers Moneytree. By 1990 this ﬁgure had already increased to $2.3 billion and in 1998 it reached nearly $20 billion. While the numbers fell after the boom period of 1999 and 2000, when VC investment peaked at almost $100 billion, in 2008 the amount invested by venture capitalists was around $28 billion.

    "abstract": "We analyze a setting in which a board must hire a chief executive ofﬁcer (CEO) after exerting effort to learn about the quality of each candidate. Optimal effort is asym- metric, implying asymmetric likelihoods of each candidate being chosen. If the board has an inﬁnitesimal bias in favor of one candidate, it allocates effort to maximize the likelihood of that candidate being chosen. Even when the board’s prior is that its pre- ferred candidate is inferior, she may still be chosen most often. A glass ceiling can also arise whereby the tendency to hire favored candidates increases as the importance of the position increases. Most Organizations Have A Single leader who must periodically be replaced. Boards choose new chief executive ofﬁcers (CEOs), sports teams choose new head coaches, and CEOs choose new chief ﬁnancial ofﬁcers (CFOs) or divisional managers. These settings differ from those in which any subset of N options can be chosen because choosing one candidate inherently requires not choosing others. Any effort to learn about one candidate is therefore either a complement or a substitute for effort to learn about others. In this paper, we show that the optimal effort that goes into choosing a new leader is often asymmetric—it is best to put varying levels of effort into learn- ing about each candidate, even if candidates are ex ante identical. This causes the likelihoods of each candidate being selected to differ. If the board has an even inﬁnitesimal bias in favor of on",

    "abstract": "Financial investment behavior is highly correlated between parents and their chil- dren. Using Swedish data, we ﬁnd that the decision of adoptees to hold equities is associated with the behavior of both biological and adoptive parents, implying a role for both genetic and environmental inﬂuences. However, we ﬁnd that nurture has a stronger inﬂuence on the share of ﬁnancial assets invested in equities and on portfolio volatility, suggesting that ﬁnancial risk-taking is substantially environmentally de- termined. The parental investment variables substantially increase the explanatory power of cross-sectional regressions and so may play an important role in understand- ing cross-sectional heterogeneity in investment behavior. Investment Behavior Varies Significantly across individuals. At the same time, investment decisions, such as the decision to invest in the equity mar- ket and the riskiness of portfolios, are similar across generations—parents who hold riskier ﬁnancial portfolios tend to have children who themselves hold riskier ﬁnancial portfolios.1 But why are participation in risky markets and ﬁnancial risk-taking correlated across generations? Does this have to do with prebirth characteristics that are correlated across generations (such as a genetic predisposition toward risk-taking), or is it that children learn from the 2016 Western Finance Association annual meetings, the 2016 European Finance Association, Austin-Bergen-London Workshop, and SoLE/EALE, as well as fr",

    "abstract": "Economic distortions can arise when financial claims trade at prices set by an intermediary rather than direct negotiation between principals. We demonstrate the problem in a specific context, the exchange of open-end mutual fund shares. Mutual funds typically set fund share price ~NAV! Using an algorithm that fails to account for nonsynchronous trading in the fund’s underlying securities. This re- sults in predictable changes in NAV, which lead to exploitable trading opportuni- ties. A modification to the pricing algorithm that corrects for nonsynchronous trading eliminates much of the predictability. However, there are many other potential sources of distortion when intermediaries set prices. THE Exchange OF Financial Securities usually involves an intermediary. In many cases the intermediary acts merely as an administrative conduit, with the terms of trade set by the transacting principals. There are, however, important instances where the intermediary sets the terms at which one or both principals commits to trade. For example, in primary security offer- ings, an investment bank typically sets the issue price; in exchanges of mu- tual fund shares, fund management sets the price; and in certain cases involving secondary market transactions, a specialist sets the price. 1 Our study is about problems that can arise when intermediaries are cast into a central role in the pricing of financial securities.

    "abstract": "We investigate a structural model of market and ﬁrm-level dynamics in order to jointly price long-dated S&P 500 index options and CDO tranches of corporate debt. We identify market dynamics from index option prices and idiosyncratic dynamics from the term structure of credit spreads. We ﬁnd that all tranches can be well priced out-of-sample before the crisis. During the crisis, however, our model can capture senior tranche prices only if we allow for the possibility of a catastrophic jump. Thus, senior tranches are nonredundant assets that provide a unique window into the pricing of catastrophic risk. Securitization— THE Process of pooling risky bonds and repackaging their cash ﬂows to create new types of securities (“tranches”) with varying levels of subordination—has been at the heart of the recent ﬁnancial crisis. Indeed, the crisis began with the demise of two mortgage hedge funds run by Bear Stearns in 2007 due to their large bets in securitized portfolios of subprime mortgage bonds. It has been widely argued that the risks of subprime mortgages had been dramatically underestimated by market participants for a variety of rea- sons, not the least being that this was a relatively new market. 1 What is perhaps less well known, however, is that the dramatic decline in the prices of securitized portfolios was not limited to subprime collateral, but instead was widespread across most major asset classes, such as commercial real estate, credit card receivables, senior unsecured",

    "abstract": "We analyze the internal capital markets of a multinational conglomerate, using a unique panel data set of planned and actual allocations to business units and a survey of unit CEOs. Following cash windfalls, more powerful managers obtain larger allocations and increase investment substantially more than their less connected peers. We identify cash windfalls as a source of misallocation of capital, as more powerful managers overinvest and their units exhibit lower ex post performance and productivity. These ﬁndings contribute to our understanding of frictions in resource allocation within ﬁrms and point to an important channel through which power may lead to inefﬁciencies. HOW DO Firms ALLOCATEresources across business units? Do units with better investment opportunities receive larger capital allocations and invest more? And, do units run by more powerful and better connected managers receive larger capital allocations? In this paper, we seek to answer these questions with direct evidence from a newly constructed data set drawn from the internal accounting system of a large multinational conglomerate that contains infor- mation about planned and actual capital allocations to its 20 business units.

    "abstract": "We show theoretically that variable production costs reduce systematic risk of ﬁrms’ cash ﬂows if capital and variable inputs are complementary in ﬁrms’ production and input prices are procyclical. In our dynamic model, this operating hedge effect is weaker for more proﬁtable ﬁrms, giving rise to a gross proﬁtability premium. More- over, gross proﬁtability and value factors are distinct and negatively correlated, and their premia are not captured by the capital asset pricing model (capm). We esti- mate the model by simulated method of moments, and ﬁnd that its main implications for stock returns and cash ﬂow dynamics are quantitatively consistent with the data. A Firm ’S Fundamental Risk IS closely linked to the joint dynamics of its revenue and costs. Variable costs, which include expenses on intermediate in- puts such as raw materials, energy , and wages of production workers that are directly related to ﬁrm’s production, are economically large—equal to (the Editor), an anonymous Associate Editor, two anonymous referees for highly valuable com- ments and suggestions that signiﬁcantly improve the paper.

    "title": "Optimal Asset Location and Allocation",
    "abstract": "We investigate optimal intertemporal asset allocation and location decisions for in- vestors making taxable and tax-deferred investments. We show a strong preference for holding taxable bonds in the tax-deferred account and equity in the taxable ac- count, reflecting the higher tax burden on taxable bonds relative to equity. For most investors, the optimal asset location policy is robust to the introduction of tax-exempt bonds and liquidity shocks. Numerical results illustrate optimal portfolio decisions as a function of age and tax-deferred wealth. Interestingly, the proportion of total wealth allocated to equity is inversely related to the fraction of total wealth in tax-deferred accounts. A Central Problem Confronting Investors in practice is how to efficiently invest the funds held in their taxable and tax-deferred savings accounts. The problem involves making both an optimal asset allocation decision (i.e., deciding how much of each asset to hold) and an optimalasset location decision (i.e., deciding which assets to hold in the taxable and tax-deferred accounts). Investors would like to make these decisions to reduce the tax burden of owning financial assets, while maintaining an optimally diversified portfolio over time. While only lim- ited guidance is available to investors faced with this problem, the decision is crucial to the wealth accumulation and welfare of investors over their lifetimes. In this paper, we examine the intertemporal portfolio problem for an inves",

    "title": "Optimal CEO Compensation with Search: Theory",
    "abstract": "We integrate an agency problem into search theory to study executive compensation in a market equilibrium. A CEO can choose to stay or quit and search after privately observing an idiosyncratic shock to the ﬁrm. The market equilibrium endogenizes CEOs’ and ﬁrms’ outside options and captures contracting externalities. We show that the optimal pay-to-performance ratio is less than one even when the CEO is risk neutral. Moreover, the equilibrium pay-to-performance sensitivity depends positively on a ﬁrm’s idiosyncratic risk and negatively on the systematic risk. Our empirical tests using executive compensation data conﬁrm these results. TWO Questions Concerning EXECUTIVEcompensation deserve particular atten- tion. The ﬁrst is: how does a ﬁrm’s risk affect CEO’s pay-to-performance sensi- tivity (hereafter PPS), that is, the ratio of incentive pay to ﬁrm performance? Standard agency models predict that PPS does not change with ﬁrm risk if the agent is risk neutral and decreases with ﬁrm risk if the agent is risk averse. Notable examples are Bolton and Dewatripont (2005, pp. 160–162), Holm- strom (1982), and Murphy (1999, pp. 27–28). In contrast to this theoretical prediction, however, the empirical evidence on the effect of ﬁrm risk on PPS is mixed.

    "title": "Optimal Capital Structure",
    "abstract": "This paper provides a competitive equilibrium model of capital structure and industry dynamics. In the model, firms make financing, investment, entry, and exit decisions subject to idiosyncratic technology shocks. The capital structure choice reflects the tradeoff between the tax benefits of debt and the associated bankruptcy and agency costs. The interaction between financing and production decisions influences the sta- tionary distribution of firms and their survival probabilities. The analysis demon- strates that the equilibrium output price has an important feedback effect. This effect has a number of testable implications. For example, high growth industries have rel- atively lower leverage and turnover rates. THE Interaction Between Capital Structure and product market decisions has recently received considerable attention in both economics and finance. Begin- ning with Brander and Lewis (1986, 1988) and Maksimovic (1988), a growing number of theoretical papers investigate this interaction. In addition, many em- pirical studies (Chevalier (1995a, 1995b), Phillips (1995), Kovenock and Phillips (1997), Maksimovic and Phillips (1998), Zingales (1998), Lang, Ofek, and Stulz (1996), Mackay and Phillips (2004)) examine the relation between capital struc- ture and firm entry, exit, investment and output decisions. 1 These studies gen- erally document the following: (1) Industry output is negatively associated with the average industry debt ratio.

    "abstract": "We consider the optimal intertemporal consumption and investment policy of a constant absolute risk aversion (cara) investor who faces fixed and proportional transaction costs when trading multiple risky assets. We show that when asset re- turns are uncorrelated, the optimal investment policy is to keep the dollar amount invested in each risky asset between two constant levels and upon reaching either of these thresholds, to trade to the corresponding optimal targets. An extensive analy- sis suggests that transaction cost is an important factor in affecting trading volume and that it can significantly diminish the importance of stock return predictability as reported in the literature. This Paper Studies THE Optimal Intertemporal Consumption and investment policy of an investor with a constant absolute risk aversion (cara) preference and an infinite horizon. The investor can trade in one risk-free asset and n ≥ 1 risky assets. In contrast to the standard setting, the investor faces both fixed and pro- portional transaction costs in trading any of these risky assets. In the absence of transaction costs and when risky asset prices follow geometric Brownian mo- tions, the optimal investment policy is to keep a constant dollar amount in each risky asset, as shown by Merton (1971). This trading strategy requires contin- uous trading in all the risky assets. In addition, the optimal consumption is affine in the total wealth.

This puts dynamic liquidity and state- balances mean-variance investment efﬁciency and the preservation of ﬁnancial slack. We show that in general the entrepreneur’s net worth is overexposed to idiosyncratic risk and underexposed to systematic risk.

Lxii, NO. 3 • June 2007 Optimal Debt and Equity Values in the Presence of Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 Mark Broadie, Mikhail Chernov, and Suresh Sundaresan∗ Explicit presence of reorganization in addition to liquidation leads to conflicts of in- terest between borrowers and lenders. In the first–best outcome, reorganization adds value to both parties via higher debt capacity, lower credit spreads, and improved over- all firm value. If control of the ex ante reorganization timing and the ex post decision to liquidate is given to borrowers, most of the benefits are appropriated by borrowers ex post. Lenders can restore the first–best outcome by seizing this control or by the ex post transfer of control rights. Reorganization is more likely and liquidation is less likely relative to the benchmark case with liquidation only. THE U.s.bankruptcy Code, which includes a liquidation process (Chapter 7) and a reorganization process (Chapter 11), aims to resolve a number of important issues associated with a distressed firm. These issues can be classified into in- formation asymmetry problems (e.g., quality of the firm, Heinkel and Zechner (1993)), agency problems (e.g., risk shifting, Jensen and Meckling (1976)), or co- ordination problems (e.g., debt of various maturities, Berglof and von Thadden (1994)).

    "abstract": "I develop a dynamic model of leverage with tax deductible interest and an endoge- nous cost of default. The interest rate includes a premium to compensate lenders for expected losses in default. A borrowing constraint is generated by lenders’ unwilling- ness to lend an amount that would trigger immediate default. When the borrowing constraint is not binding, the trade-off theory of debt holds: optimal debt equates the marginal interest tax shield and the marginal expected cost of default. Contrary to conventional interpretation, but consistent with empirical ﬁndings, increases in current or future proﬁtability reduce the optimal leverage ratio when the trade-off theory holds. THE Trade -OFF Theory OF capital structure is the longest standing theory of capital structure 1 and underlies much of the large body of empirical work on capital structure. According to the trade-off theory, the optimal amount of debt equates the marginal beneﬁt of a dollar of debt arising from the tax deductibil- ity of interest payments with the marginal cost of a dollar of debt arising from increased exposure to default. This framework implies that changes in leverage over time, or variation in leverage across ﬁrms, can be attributed to differences in the marginal interest tax shield and/or differences in the marginal cost of default. The trade-off theory has been conventionally interpreted 2 as implying that more proﬁtable ﬁrms should have higher leverage ratios—a prediction that runs counter to the",

    "abstract": "We study an institutional investment problem in which a centralized decision maker, the Chief Investment Officer (CIO), for example, employs multiple asset managers to implement investment strategies in separate asset classes. The CIO allocates capital to the managers who, in turn, allocate these funds to the assets in their asset class. This two-step investment process causes several misalignments of objectives between the CIO and his managers and can lead to large utility costs for the CIO. We focus on (1) loss of diversification, (2) unobservable managerial appetite for risk, and (3) different investment horizons. We derive an optimal unconditional linear performance benchmark and show that this benchmark can be used to better align incentives within the firm. We find that the CIO’s uncertainty about the managers’ risk appetites increases both the costs of decentralized investment management and the value of an optimally designed benchmark. THE Investment Management Divisions OF Banks, mutual funds, and pension funds are predominantly structured around asset classes such as equities, fixed in- come, and alternative investments. To achieve superior returns, either through asset selection or market timing, gathering information about specific assets and capitalizing on the acquired informational advantage requires a high level of specialization. This induces the centralized decision maker of the firm, the Chief Investment Officer (CIO), for example, to pick asset managers wh",

    "title": "Optimal Diversification: Reconciling",
    "abstract": "In this paper we show that the main empirical findings about firm diversification and performance are consistent with the maximization of shareholder value. In our model, diversification allows a firm to explore better productive opportunities while taking advantage of synergies. By explicitly linking the diversification strategies of the firm to differences in size and productivity, our model provides a natural labo- ratory to investigate several aspects of the relationship between diversification and performance. Specifically, we show that our model can rationalize the evidence on the diversification discount (Lang and Stulz (1994)) and the documented relation between diversification and productivity (Schoar (2002)). Empirical Work ON Firm Diversification has often been interpreted as support- ing the view that conglomerates are inefficient. Findings such as the fact that conglomerates trade at a discount, relative to a portfolio of comparable stand- alone firms, have led researchers to believe that diversification destroys value. Popular explanations for this “diversification discount” have generally em- phasized the agency and behavioral problems associated with the existence of conglomerates. 2 Unfortunately, this view of diversification creates at least two difficulties for researchers. First, while addressing the effects of diversi- fication on performance, agency models often fail to answer the more funda- mental economic question of why diversified firms exist at all",

    "abstract": "This paper characterizes the optimal transaction tax in an equilibrium model of ﬁ- nancial markets. If investors hold heterogeneous beliefs unrelated to their funda- mental trading motives and the planner calculates welfare using any single belief, a positive tax is optimal, regardless of the magnitude of fundamental trading. Under some conditions, the optimal tax is independent of the planner’s belief. The optimal tax can be implemented by adjusting its value until total volume equals fundamen- tal volume. Knowledge of (i) the share of nonfundamental trading volume and (ii) the semielasticity of trading volume to tax changes is sufﬁcient to quantify the opti- mal tax. Whether TO TAX Financial Transactions or not remains an important open question for public economics that periodically gains broad relevance after periods of economic turmoil. For instance, the collapse of the Bretton Woods system motivated James Tobin’s well-known 1972 speech—published as Tobin ( 1978)—endorsing a tax on international transactions. The 1987 crash led Stiglitz ( 1989) and Summers and Summers ( 1989) to argue for implement- ing a transaction tax, while the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis spurred further public debate on the issue, leading to a contested tax proposal by the European Com- mission. However, with the lack of formal normative studies on this topic, a ﬁnancial transaction tax may still seem like “the perennial favorite answer in search of a question,” per Cochrane ( 2013).

    "abstract": "This paper analyzes a regulator’s optimal strategic delay of resolving banks when the regulator’s announcement of the intervention delay endogenously affects the deposi- tors’ run propensity. Given intervention, the regulator either liquidates the remain- ing illiquid assets (“prompt corrective action”) or continues managing the assets at a reduced skill level (“resolution under receivership”). In either case, I show that if the regulator tolerates fewer withdrawals until intervention, the depositors may react by preempting the regulator: they run on the bank more often ex ante. A policy of never intervening can leave the bank more stable than a conservative intervention policy. Banking IS A Highly Regulated industry. Bank runs and regulatory mechanisms for bank-run prevention have been extensively studied in the literature (see, for instance, Diamond and Dybvig ( 1983), Goldstein and Pauzner (2005) and Ennis and Keister ( 2009)). Regulators not only set deposit- insurance levels but also decide when to resolve banks (Martin, Puri, and Uﬁer (2017)). Once an institution is perceived as failing, the regulator, through its resolution authority (RA), can intervene, suspend the convertibility of deposits, and resolve the bank. This paper analyzes how a regulator’s intervention delay (“forbearance”), measured in terms of tolerated withdrawals until intervention, affects the de- positors’ propensity to run on the bank.

    "abstract": "We show that a life-cycle model with realistically calibrated uninsurable labor income risk and moderate risk aversion can simultaneously match stock market participation rates and asset allocation decisions conditional on participation. The key ingredients of the model are Epstein–Zin preferences, a fixed stock market entry cost, and moderate heterogeneity in risk aversion. Households with low risk aversion smooth earnings shocks with a small buffer stock of assets, and consequently most of them (optimally) never invest in equities. Therefore, the marginal stockholders are (endogenously) more risk averse, and as a result they do not invest their portfolios fully in stocks. IN This Paper , WE Present A Life -cycle Asset allocation model with intermediate consumption and stochastic uninsurable labor income that provides an expla- nation for two very important empirical observations: low stock market partic- ipation rates in the population as a whole, and moderate equity holdings for stock market participants. Our life-cycle model integrates three main motives that have been identi- fied as quantitatively important in explaining individual and aggregate wealth accumulation. First, a precautionary savings motive driven by the presence of undiversifiable labor income risk (Deaton (1991) and Carroll (1992, 1997)).

    "abstract": "This paper examines how risky labor income and retirement affect optimal port- folio choice. With idiosyncratic labor income risk, the optimal allocation to stocks is unambiguously larger for employed investors than for retired investors, consistent with the typical recommendations of investment advisors. Increasing idiosyncratic labor income risk raises investors' willingness to save and reduces their stock port- folio allocation towards the level of retired investors. Positive correlation between labor income and stock returns has a further negative effect and can actually re- duce stockholdings below the level of retired investors. Financial Advisors Typically Recommend that their customers invest more in stocks than in safe assets when they are working, and to shift their invest- ments towards safe assets when they retire (Jagannathan and Kocherlakota (1996), Malkiel (1996)). By contrast, the standard academic models of port- folio choice (Merton (1969, 1971), Samuelson (1969)) show that retirement is irrelevant for portfolio decisions if investment opportunities are constant and human capital is tradable. In this case the fraction of wealth optimally invested in risky assets should be constant over the lifetime of an individual. That time-varying investment opportunities result in portfolio rules with an intertemporal hedging component whose magnitude depends on the invest- ment horizon of the investor (Kim and Omberg (1996), Balduzzi and Lynch (1997), Brennan, Schwartz,",

    "abstract": "We derive the optimal dynamic contract in a continuous-time principal-agent setting, and implement it with a capital structure (credit line, long-term debt, and equity) over which the agent controls the payout policy. While the project’s volatility and liq- uidation cost have little impact on the firm’s total debt capacity, they increase the use of credit versus debt. Leverage is nonstationary, and declines with past profitability. The firm may hold a compensating cash balance while borrowing (at a higher rate) through the credit line. Surprisingly, the usual conflicts between debt and equity (asset substitution, strategic default) need not arise. IN This Paper , WE Consider A Dynamic Contracting Environment in which a risk- neutral agent or entrepreneur with limited resources manages an investment activity. While the investment is profitable, it is also risky, and in the short run it can generate arbitrarily large operating losses. The agent will need outside financial support to cover such losses and continue the project. The difficulty is that while the probability distribution of the cash flows is publicly known, the agent may distort these cash flows by taking a hidden action that leads to a private benefit. Specifically, the agent may (i) conceal and divert cash flows for his own consumption, and/or (ii) stop providing costly effort, which would reduce the mean of the cash flows.

    "abstract": "We study the dynamic proﬁt-maximizing selling mechanism in a merger and acquisi- tions (M&A) environment with costly bidder entry and without entry fees. Depending on the parameters, the optimal mechanism is implemented by a standard auction or by a two-stage procedure with exclusive offers to one bidder followed by an auction potentially favoring that bidder. The optimal mechanism may involve common deal protections like termination fees, asset lockups, or stock option lockups. Our proposed procedures resemble sales of targets ﬁling Chapter 11 bankruptcy or M&A involving public targets, and they shed light on how to use deal protections in practice. Selling Procedures ARE AN Important yet understudied aspect of mergers and acquisitions (M&A). Conventional wisdom suggests that to maxi- mize the proﬁt from a sale, the target should use standard auctions, where the target invites all potential bidders to a bidding contest at the same time. In practice, however, targets also conduct sequential negotiations, where bidders are contacted one after another. These sequential mechanisms are also often asymmetric, favoring one bidder by means ofdeal protections.

    "title": "Option Mispricing around Nontrading Periods",
    "abstract": "We ﬁnd that option returns are signiﬁcantly lower over nontrading periods, the vast majority of which are weekends. Our evidence suggests that nontrading returns can- not be explained by risk, but rather are the result of widespread and highly persistent option mispricing driven by the incorrect treatment of stock return variance during periods of market closure. The size of the effect implies that the broad spectrum of study further suggests how alternative industry practices could improve the efﬁciency of option markets in a meaningful way. A Variety OF INSTITUTIONALand psychological factors suggest that portfolio risk and return may differ between periods of trading and nontrading. The stock market is more volatile over trading periods than over nontrading periods, possibly due to a lower rate of private information revelation (French and Roll (1986)). It is also profoundly less liquid outside of regular trading hours, which should drive a wedge between average returns over trading and nontrading periods (French (1980), Longstaff (1995), Kelly and Clark (2011), Cliff, Cooper, and Gulen (2008)). Prolonged periods of nontrading may also give investors with limited attention a chance to process stale information, whether contained in ﬁrm earnings announcements (Dellavigna and Pollet (2009)) or news more generally (Garcia (2013)). Finally, traders may have a strong desire to exit the market over nontrading periods, with no open positions, particularly for more speculative stra",

This phenomenon is robust to including out-of-the-money options or delta-hedging the re- turns. Unlike stock momentum, option return continuation is not followed by long- run reversal. Signiﬁcant returns remain after factor risk adjustment and after con- trolling for implied volatility and other characteristics. Across stocks, trading costs are unrelated to the magnitude of momentum proﬁts. Momentum , THE Tendency FOR Assets that have earned above-average returns in the past to continue to outperform in the future, is one of the most pervasive and widely studied ﬁnancial market anomalies. While the orig- inal study of Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) focused solely on U.S. Common stock returns, the phenomenon has been found in global stocks (Rouwenhorst (1998)), corporate bonds (Jostova et al. (2013)), commodities (Erb and Harvey (2006)), and currencies (Okunev and White (2003)). Momentum is also found in stock portfolios, including industries (Moskowitz and Grinblatt (1999)), coun- tries (Richards (1997)), and long/short factors (Ehsani and Linnainmaa (2022), Gupta and Kelly (2019)). In this paper, we ask whether momentum also exists within the options mark",

    "abstract": "This paper characterizes all continuous price processes that are consistent with current option prices. This extends Derman and Kani (1994), Dupire (1994, 1997), and Rubinstein (1994), who only consider processes with deterministic volatility. Our characterization implies a volatility forecast that does not require a specific model, only current option prices. We show how arbitrary volatility processes can be adjusted to fit current option prices exactly, just as interest rate processes can be adjusted to fit bond prices exactly. The procedure works with many volatility models, is fast to calibrate, and can price exotic options efficiently using familiar lattice techniques. THE Standard Approach TO Option Pricing specifies a process for the price of the underlying security, and then derives option prices as a function of the process parameters. This paper essentially reverses the procedure. A com- plete set of option prices1 is taken as given, and is used to extract as much information as possible about the underlying price process (the \"process\").2 Our main result is a simple condition which characterizes the set of contin- uous processes that are consistent with current option prices. All consistent processes satisfy our condition and therefore share certain features. In particular, all consistent processes generate a common (risk- neutral) expectation of squared price volatility over a specified horizon, and therefore imply the same forecast of volatility.

    "title": "Option Pricing on Stocks in Mergers",
    "abstract": "We develop an arbitrage-free and complete framework to price options on the stocks of firms involved in a merger or acquisition deal allowing for the possibility that the deal might be called off at an intermediate time, creating discontinuous impacts on the stock prices. Our model can be a normative tool for market makers to quote prices for options on stocks involved in such deals and also for traders to control risks associated with such deals using traded options. The results of tests indicate that the model performs significantly better than the Black–Scholes model in explaining observed option prices. There Were 279 Merger AND Acquisition deals announced during the calendar year 2001, of which 177 deals involved firms where either the target or the acquirer had traded options and 67 deals involved firms where both the target and the acquirer had traded options. With the growing number of stocks that have listed options and the accompanying growth in the volume of trading in options, the problem of correctly valuing options on the stocks of firms involved in such deals is increasingly relevant and important. Valuing options on the stocks of merging firms is not straightforward because the stock price processes after deal announcement are affected by the pending deal, and there is also the possibility that the deal might be called off, which may have discontinuous impacts on the stock prices. As a result, pricing options on the stocks of merging firms in the Black–Scholes",

    "abstract": "This paper develops a new top-down valuation framework that links the pricing of an option investment to its daily proﬁt and loss attribution. The framework uses the Black-Merton-Scholes option pricing formula to attribute the short-term option in- vestment risk to variation in the underlying security price and the option’s implied volatility. Taking risk-neutral expectation and demanding no dynamic arbitrage re- sult in a pricing relation that links an option’s fair implied volatility level to the underlying volatility level with corrections for the implied volatility’s own expected direction of movement, its variance, and its covariance with the underlying security return. A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds. —Ralph Waldo Emerson Different Modeling Frameworks Serve DIFFERENTpurposes. A major focus of the existing option pricing literature is to derive option values that are inter- nally consistent across all strikes and maturities. The literature speciﬁes the full dynamics of the underlying security price, including the full dynamics of its instantaneous variance rate, and performs valuation of all options by taking risk-neutral expectations of their terminal payoffs. The full dynamics speciﬁ- cation creates a single reference distribution of the relevant terminal random variable, which is then used to take the expectation. Under this approach, even if the assumed dynamics are wrong, the valuations on the option contracts re- main consistent with one anot",

    "abstract": "Using a utility function to adjust the risk-neutral PDF embedded in cross sections of options, we obtain measures of the risk aversion implied in option prices. Using Ftse 100 and S&P 500 options, and both power and exponential-utility functions, we esti- mate the representative agent’s relative risk aversion (RRA) at different horizons. The estimated coefficients of RRA are all reasonable. The RRA estimates are remarkably consistent across utility functions and across markets for given horizons. The degree of RRA declines broadly with the forecast horizon and is lower during periods of high market volatility. Estimating THE Representative Agent ’S or the market’s degree of risk aversion from securities prices has a long history. However, it is only recently that schol- ars have begun using options data to do so. Options provide a particularly promising context for studying risk preferences. Stocks are infinitely lived and so inferences must be drawn from the discounted stream of cash flows over an indefinite horizon. Usually this involves additional assumptions as to how those cash flows evolve (e.g., constant growth of dividends). Since only one value, the discounted present value of all cash flows, is known, no inferences are possible about variations in preferences over different horizons. Options on the other hand have a fixed expiry date at which payoffs are realized. 1 Furthermore, options contracts exist for different investment horizons. Options thus permit studying",

    "abstract": "Many believe that a bubble existed in Internet stocks in the 1999 to 2000 period, and that short-sale restrictions prevented rational investors from driving Internet stock prices to reasonable levels. In the presence of such short-sale constraints, option and stock prices could decouple during a bubble. Using intraday options data from the peak of the Internet bubble, we find almost no evidence that synthetic stock prices diverged from actual stock prices. We also show that the general public could cheaply short synthetically using options. In summary, we find no evidence that short-sale restrictions affected Internet stock prices. Prices OF Nasdaq-listed Technology Stocks rose dramatically in the late 1990s, peaked in March 2000, and then lost more than two thirds of their value over the next two years. Many of the largest price run-ups and subsequent collapses were associated with Internet stocks. Indeed, few of these companies were profitable and most had minimal revenues. Accordingly, many observers have concluded that a bubble existed for Internet stocks in the 1999 to 2000 period and thus that prices of these stocks were irrationally high. If Internet stock prices were obviously irrationally high, why did not ratio- nal investors sell them short and drive prices back to rational levels? Probably the simplest and most popular explanation is that traders could not borrow and short them at a reasonable cost (Ofek and Richardson (2003)). More- over, even if investors found",

We find that mar- ket and limit order submissions and cancellations increase significantly during trading halts, that a large proportion of the limit order book at the reopen is com- posed of orders submitted during the halt, and that the market-clearing price at the reopen is a good predictor of future prices. Depth near the quotes is unusually low around trading halts, though specialists and/or floor traders appear to provide additional liquidity at these times. Finally, specialists appear to \"spread the quote\" prior to imbalance halts to convey information to market participants. THE Costs AND Benefits Associated with New York Stock Exchange trading halts are the subject of continuous debate. The stated purpose of trading halts is to allow investors a chance to react to new information and to facilitate the orderly emergence of a new equilibrium price (see, e.g., Nyse (1999)). However, little is known about the extent or nature of investor reactions to trading halts. Furthermore, it is unclear whether these reactions support or confound attempts to reach a new equilibrium price. To address these issues, we use nonpublic Nyse data on all SuperDOT (electronic) orders to analyze the effects of trading halts on order flow, spreads, and the limit order book. We also examine the relationships between the limit order book and the reopening price and between liquidity and post-halt volatility. Information on order flow i",

    "abstract": "Organization capital is a production factor that is embodied in the ﬁrm’s key talent and has an efﬁciency that is ﬁrm speciﬁc. Hence, both shareholders and key talent have a claim to its cash ﬂows. We develop a model in which the outside option of the key talent determines the share of ﬁrm cash ﬂows that accrue to shareholders. This outside option varies systematically and renders ﬁrms with high organization capital riskier from shareholders’ perspective. We ﬁnd that ﬁrms with more organization capital have average returns that are 4.6% higher than ﬁrms with less organization capital. IN Recent Decades, Intangible capital has become an increasingly important factor of production. In many instances, such intangible capital is embodied in the ﬁrm’s key employees. We refer to this type of intangible capital as orga- nization capital and develop a structural model to analyze its effect on asset prices. We argue that shareholders consider ﬁrms with high levels of organi- zation capital to be riskier than ﬁrms with more physical capital, and provide empirical evidence supporting this claim. Organization capital is a durable input in production that is distinct from physical capital. In our model, the distinguishing features of organization cap- ital are that its efﬁciency is partly ﬁrm speciﬁc and that it is embodied in the ﬁrm’s key talent. Together, these two characteristics imply that both sharehold- ers and key talent have a claim on the cash ﬂows accruing from organization cap",

    "abstract": "Many cities have attracted a ﬂurry of out-of-town (OOT) home buyers. Such capital inﬂows affect house prices, rents, construction, labor income, wealth, and ultimately welfare. We develop an equilibrium model to quantify the welfare effects of OOT home buyers for the typical U.S. Metropolitan area. When OOT investors buy 10% of by 0.61% in consumption-equivalent units. House prices and rents rise substantially , resulting in welfare gains for owners and losses for renters. Policies that tax OOT buyers or mandate renting out vacant property mitigate welfare losses. Residential Investment IN Major Urban centers by out-of-town (OOT)— including foreign—investors has been on the rise. For example, the United States attracted $153 billion in foreign residential real estate investment be- tween April 2016 and March 2017, accounting for 10% of all purchases. These investment ﬂows are controversial as they tend to leave highly desirable real estate underutilized and are thought to push up the cost of housing for local residents, fueling the affordability issues these cities already struggle with. Public opposition to OOT investor ﬂows has led many large cities to tax res- idential property purchases by nonresidents. But OOT investors bring ben- eﬁts as well.

    "abstract": "Equity financing is modeled when cash flows and asset values are not verifiable. Investors have enforceable property rights to the firm's assets, but cannot prevent insiders (managers or entrepreneurs) from capturing cash flow. Insiders must co- invest and pay in each period a dividend sufficient to ensure outside investors' participation for at least one more period. Intervention by the investors must be limited by an agreement with insiders or by costs of collective action. Basic models are extended to show why firms go public and why agency costs necessarily arise when the act of investment is not immediately verifiable. Sooner OR Later THE Theory OF Corporate Finance must deal generally with the self-interest of corporate managers and employees. Theory ought to ex- plain how outside equity financing works when insiders are not inclined to act in outside investors' interests. Jensen and Meckling so argued in 1976. Since then principal-agent theory has advanced steadily. There are deep analyses of the nature of property rights and control, and of the feasibility and optimality of external financing when the internal affairs of the firm are verifiable only at a cost or not at Stulz (1988), Hart and Moore (1994, 1998), Bolton and Scharfstein (1990), and Hart (1995, Chap. 5).

    "abstract": "We investigate the effects of managerial outsourcing on the performance and incen- tives of mutual funds. Fund families outsource the management of a large fraction of their funds to advisory ﬁrms. These funds underperform those run internally by about 52 basis points per year. After instrumenting for a fund’s outsourcing status, the estimated underperformance is three times larger. We hypothesize that contrac- tual externalities due to ﬁrm boundaries make it difﬁcult to extract performance from an outsourced relationship. Consistent with this view, outsourced funds face higher powered incentives; they are more likely to be closed after poor performance and excessive risk-taking. Over THE Most RECENTdecades, open-end mutual funds have been among the fastest growing types of institutions in this country. From 1980 to 2011, the percentage of American households owning mutual funds rose from 5.7% to leveled off in recent years, the mutual fund industry remains important in the economy. Actively managed funds control a sizeable stake of corporate equity and play a pivotal role in the determination of stock prices (see, for example, Grinblatt, Titman, and Wermers (1995), Gompers and Metrick (2001)). For instance, while they held only 4% of all U.S. Equity in 1980, that number a similar period, the fraction of U.S. Equity directly held by individuals fell from 47.9% to 21.5% (French (2008)).

    "abstract": "We study outsourcing relationships among international asset management ﬁrms. We ﬁnd that, in companies that manage both outsourced and in-house funds, in- house funds outperform outsourced funds by 0.85% annually (57% of the expense ratio). We attribute this result to preferential treatment of in-house funds via the preferential allocation of IPOs, trading opportunities, and cross-trades, especially at times when in-house funds face steep outﬂows and require liquidity. We explain preferential treatment with agency problems: it increases with the subcontractor’s market power and the difﬁculty of monitoring the subcontractor, and decreases with the subcontractor’s amount of parallel in-house activity. THE Complexity OF Investment DECISIONSand the need for specialized informa- tion makes the outsourcing of portfolio management an important dimension of the ﬁnancial services industry. This is especially true in the international arena, where outsourcing to local managers may entail beneﬁts in the form of privileged access to information and better connections to the authorities. For example, a fund specializing in international investments, even if it is mar- keted and sold by an American ﬁrm to American investors, may delegate the actual trading decisions to a subcontractor manager located in another country, often close to the investment focus of the fund. In 2008, 24% (20%) of all global mutual funds (mutual fund assets) were managed by subcontractor ﬁrms. However, outsourcin",

    "abstract": "We empirically study whether systematic over-the-counter (OTC) market frictions drive the large unexplained common factor in yield spread changes. Using transac- tion data on U.S. Corporate bonds, we ﬁnd that marketwide inventory, search, and bargaining frictions explain 23.4% of the variation in the common component. System- atic OTC frictions thus substantially improve the explanatory power of yield spread changes and account for one-third of their total explained variation. Search and bar- gaining frictions combined explain more in the common dynamics of yield spread changes than inventory frictions. Our ﬁndings support the implications of leading theories of intermediation frictions in OTC markets. According TO Frictionless No-arbitrage Theory, changes in corporate yield spreads occur because of innovations in ﬁrm-speciﬁc and macroeconomic funda- mentals. This paradigm has been challenged by empirical studies showing that yield spread changes are difﬁcult to explain. Using conventional factors, Collin- Dufresne, Goldstein, and Martin (2001, Cdgm henceforth) show that a large set of ﬁrm-speciﬁc and macroeconomic variables perform poorly in explaining the variation in yield spread changes over time.

    "abstract": "This paper offers a model in which asset prices reflect both covariance risk and misperceptions of firms' prospects, and in which arbitrageurs trade against mis- pricing. In equilibrium, expected returns are linearly related to both risk and mis- pricing measures (e.g., fundamental/price ratios). With many securities, mispricing of idiosyncratic value components diminishes but systematic mispricing does not. The theory offers untested empirical implications about volume, volatility, fundamental/price ratios, and mean returns, and is consistent with several empir- ical findings. These include the ability of fundamental/price ratios and market value to forecast returns, and the domination of beta by these variables in some studies. THE Classic Theory OF Securities Market equilibrium beginning with Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1965), and Black (1972) is based on the interaction of fully rational optimizing investors.

Moreover, a risk-averse CEO’s overconfidence enhances firm value up to a point, but the effect is nonmonotonic and differs from that of lower risk aversion. Overconfident CEOs also underinvest in information production. The board fires both excessively diffident and excessively overconfident CEOs.

    "abstract": "We show that measurable managerial characteristics have signiﬁcant explanatory power for corporate ﬁnancing decisions. First, managers who believe that their ﬁrm is undervalued view external ﬁnancing as overpriced, especially equity ﬁnancing. Such overconﬁdent managers use less external ﬁnance and, conditional on accessing exter- nal capital, issue less equity than their peers. Second, CEOs who grew up during the Great Depression are averse to debt and lean excessively on internal ﬁnance. Third, CEOs with military experience pursue more aggressive policies, including heightened leverage. Complementary measures of CEO traits based on press portrayals conﬁrm the results. What ARE THE PRIMARYdeterminants of ﬁrms’ ﬁnancing decisions? Traditional theories emphasize ﬁrm-, industry-, and market-level explanations, such as the trade-off between the tax deductibility of interest payments and bankruptcy costs, or asymmetric information between ﬁrms and the capital market (Miller (1977), Myers (1984), Myers and Majluf (1984)).

Preferences for competition correlate with income only at graduation when bonuses are guaranteed and not a function of per- formance. Overconﬁdent competition-loving MBAs observe lower compensation and income growth, and experience greater exit from high-reward industries and more frequent job interruptions. Preferences for competition do not explain the gender pay gap among MBAs. Agerial compensation, with this gap even larger than for regular jobs (Bertrand and Hallock ( 2001), Kulich et al. ( 2011), Blau and Kahn ( 2017)). One possible explanation for this gap is the fact that, as Niederle and Vesterlund ( 2007) document, women shy away from competitive tournaments. 1 This hypothesis ﬁnds support in recent papers that use Niederle and Vesterlund’s measure to study subsequent life choices and outcomes, such as high-school students’ ed- ucational choices (e.g., Buser, Niederle, and Oosterbeek ( 2014)) and income in the general population (Buser, Niederle, and Oosterbeek ( 2020)). These studies ﬁnd that preferences for competition boost positive economic outcomes. 2 The paper version of this paper was distributed",

    "title": "Overconﬁdence, Compensation Contracts,",
    "abstract": "A risk-averse manager’s overconﬁdence makes him less conservative. As a result, it is cheaper for ﬁrms to motivate him to pursue valuable risky projects. When com- pensation endogenously adjusts to reﬂect outside opportunities, moderate levels of overconﬁdence lead ﬁrms to offer the manager ﬂatter compensation contracts that make him better off. Overconﬁdent managers are also more attractive to ﬁrms than their rational counterparts because overconﬁdence commits them to exert effort to learn about projects. Still, too much overconﬁdence is detrimental to the manager since it leads him to accept highly convex compensation contracts that expose him to excessive risk. AV AST Experimental Literature ﬁnds that individuals are usually overconﬁ- dent in that they believe their knowledge to be more precise than it actually is. The incidence of overconﬁdence is likely to be even greater among CEOs than among individuals at large; for example, Goel and Thakor (2008) show that overconﬁdent individuals are more likely to win the intraﬁrm tourna- ments that lead to the rank of CEO. Since overconﬁdence directly inﬂuences decision-making, it is logical to investigate the effects that overconﬁdent man- agers have on corporate policies and ﬁrm value. How does overconﬁdence affect the investment decisions that managers make on behalf of shareholders? How do compensation contracts optimally adjust to these effects? Do ﬁrms beneﬁt from managerial overconﬁdence? Can overconﬁdence ever beneﬁt the b",

    "abstract": "We use a sample of 800 firms in eight East Asian countries to study the effect of ownership structure on value during the region's financial crisis. The crisis negatively impacted firms' investment opportunities, raising the incentives of controlling shareholders to expropriate minority investors. Crisis period stock returns of firms in which managers have high levels of control rights, but have separated their control and cash flow ownership, are 10-20 percen- tage points lower than those of other firms. The evidence is consistent with the view that ownership structure plays an important role in determining whether insiders expropriate minority shareholders. Conflict OF Interest Between Corporate Insiders (controlling shareholders and managers) and outside investors is central to the analysis of the modern corpora- tion in which insiders have less than full ownership of the cash flow rights of the firm (Berle and Means (1932) and Jensen and Meckling (1976)). These analyses suggest that the firm's ownership structure is a primary determinant of the extent of agency problems between controlling insiders and outside investors, which has important implications for the valuation of the firm. The insiders who control corporate assets can potentially expropriate outside investors by diverting resources for their personal use or by committing funds to unprofitable projects that provide private benefits. By diverting resources for pri- vate benefit, controlling managers have the oppo",

    "title": "Partial Privatization and Firm Performance",
    "abstract": "Most privatization programs begin with a period of partial privatization in which only non-controlling shares of firms are sold on the stock market. Since management control is not transferred to private owners it is widely contended that partial priva- tization has little impact. This perspective ignores the role that the stock market can play in monitoring and rewarding managerial performance even when the govern- ment remains the controlling owner. Using data on Indian state-owned enterprises we find that partial privatization has a positive impact on profitability, productivity, and investment. Widespread Privatization IN Recent Decades has generated a large empirical lit- erature concerning the effect of ownership on firm performance. Most studies find that privatization has a positive impact on the profitability and efficiency of firms (see Megginson and Netter (2001) for a recent survey). 1 The firms in these studies have had a majority of their assets privatized and control rights have been transferred from the government to private owners. Surprisingly, little is known about the effect of partial privatization where the government remains the controlling owner. This paper seeks to address this gap in the lit- erature by investigating whether the performance of state-owned enterprises in India is affected by the sale of non-controlling equity stakes on the stock market. Understanding the impact of partial privatization is important because most privatization transacti",

    "abstract": "We present a simple rational model to highlight the effect of investors’ participation costs on the response of mutual fund flows to past fund performance. By incorporat- ing participation costs into a model in which investors learn about managers’ ability from past returns, we show that mutual funds with lower participation costs have a higher flow sensitivity to medium performance and a lower flow sensitivity to high performance than their higher-cost peers. Using various fund characteristics as prox- ies for the reduction in participation costs, we provide empirical evidence supporting the model’s implications for the asymmetric flow-performance relationship. Many Researchers Document AN asymmetric relationship between mutual fund flows and past performance: Funds with superior recent performance enjoy disproportionately large new money inflows, while funds with poor performance suffer smaller outflows. 1 Moreover, fund characteristics such as age, volatility of past performance, affiliation with a large or “star”-producing fund complex, and marketing expenditures affect both the level of fund flows and the sensitivity of flows to past performance. 2 In this paper, we develop a rational model to explain simultaneously the asymmetric response of fund flows to past performance and of South Carolina.

    "title": "Pass-through and Exposure",
    "abstract": "Firms differ in the extent to which they \"pass through\" changes in exchange rates into foreign currency prices and in their \"exposure\" to exchange rates-the respon- siveness of their profits to changes in exchange rates. Because pricing affects prof- itability, a firm's pass-through and exposure should be related. This paper develops models of exporting firms under imperfect competition to study these related phe- nomena. From these models we derive the optimal pass-through decisions and the resulting exchange rate exposure. The models are estimated on eight Japanese ex- port industries using both the price data pass-through and financial data for exposure. Exchange Rates CAN Have A Major influence on the pricing behavior and prof- itability of exporting and importing firms. Firms differ in the extent to which they \"pass through\" the change in exchange rates into the prices they charge in foreign markets. They also differ in their \"exposure\" to exchange rates- the responsiveness of their profits to changes in exchange rates. Previous papers have studied either pass-through or exposure, but none has studied these two phenomena together. Yet, because pricing directly affects profit- ability, the exposure of a firm's profits to exchange rates should be governed by many of the same firm and industry characteristics that determine pric- ing behavior. This paper develops models of firm and industry behavior that are used to study these closely related phenomena together. It also pr",

    "abstract": "Though widely used in executive compensation, inside debt has been almost entirely rangements in 237 large capitalization firms. Among our findings are that CEO com- pensation exhibits a balance between debt and equity incentives; the balance shifts systematically away from equity and toward debt as CEOs grow older; annual in- creases in pension entitlements represent about 10% of overall CEO compensation, and about 13% for CEOs aged 61–65; CEOs with high debt incentives manage their firms conservatively; and pension compensation influences patterns of CEO turnover and cash compensation. IN THE Three Decades Since THE Publication of Jensen and Meckling (1976), a vast academic literature has emerged on executive compensation. This liter- ature focuses predominantly on equity-based compensation, paid in the form of restricted stock, stock options, and other instruments whose value is tied to future equity returns.

In our model, banks operate in separate zones, and issue claims to entrepreneurs who purchase some inputs outside their own zone. Settling bank claims across zones in- curs a cost. In equilibrium, a liquidity externality arises when zones are sufﬁciently different in their outsourcing propensities—a bank may restrict its own lending be- cause it needs to hold liquidity against claims issued by another bank. Our work highlights that the disparate motives for interbank borrowing (investing in produc- tive projects and managing liquidity) can have different effects on efﬁciency . There ARE Large Payment Flows between banks. For example, in 2017, the Federal funds market had an average daily volume of $75 to $100 billion. Similarly , the Clearing House Interbank Payments System, the largest private clearing house in the United States, processes transfers of $1.5 trillion per day .1 In this paper, we ask: what is the role of banks in the payment system, and how does this role affect their lending function? To address these questions, we construct a stylized model with three impor- tant elements. First, banks process payments that generate interbank obliga- tions. As in practice, claims issued on accounts at one bank may be deposited and withdrawn at another bank. Second, payment ﬂows are tied to the level of demand deposits held by banks.

    "abstract": "The paper argues that the market significantly overvalues firms with severely un- derfunded pension plans. These companies earn lower stock returns than firms with healthier pension plans for at least 5 years after the first emergence of the underfund- ing. The low returns are not explained by risk, price momentum, earnings momentum, or accruals. Further, the evidence suggests that investors do not anticipate the impact of the pension liability on future earnings, and they are surprised when the nega- tive implications of underfunding ultimately materialize. Finally, underfunded firms have poor operating performance, and they earn low returns, although they are value companies. THE Combination OF A Deep Bear Stock Market and a sharp fall in interest rates during the period 2000 to 2002 has resulted in a $400 billion deterioration of the funding status of defined benefit (DB) pension plans in the United States. The ment firms started the calendar year 2003 with a report on corporate pension funding and accounting. As one might expect, the main theme of these reports is whether or not current market valuations correctly reflect this liability and its implications for future corporate cash flows. The correct valuation of the corporate pension liability does not concern only stock market efficiency; indeed it has macroeconomic implications.

    "abstract": "We show that top management incentives vary by responsibility. For oversight executives, pay-performance incentives are $1.22 per thousand dollar increase in shareholder wealth higher than for divisional executives. For CEOs, incen- tives are $5.65 higher than for divisional executives. Incentives for the median top management team are substantial at $32.32. CEOs account for 42 to 58 per- cent of aggregate team incentives. For divisional executives, the pay-divisional performance sensitivity is positive and increasing in the precision of divi- sional performance and the pay-firm performance sensitivity is decreasing in the precision of divisional performance. These results support principal- agent models with multiple signals of managerial effort. Much OF THE Academic Literature and popular discussion of executive compensation focuses on the incentives provided to chief executive officers (CEOs). However, public corporations are run by teams of top managers, and each of these man- agers has different responsibilities. For example, chief operating officers have broad oversight authority for the firm as a whole. In contrast, heads of large divi- sions have more narrowly defined authority but bear direct responsibility for a subset of the firm's activities. The focus on CEOs ignores important issues in the internal organization of the firm.

Controlling for the Fama–French (1993) three factors and momentum, aggregate and average estimates of alphas are statistically indistinguishable from zero. Even though there is consid- erable heterogeneity in performance, there is only modest evidence of persistence in three-factor models and little to none in four-factor models. THE Twin Questions OF Whether Investment MANAGERSgenerate superior risk- adjusted returns (“alpha”) and whether superior performance persists are cen- tral to our understanding of efﬁcient capital markets. Academic opinion on these issues revolves around the most recent evidence incorporating either new data or improved measurement technology. Although Jensen’s (1968) orig- inal examination of mutual funds concludes that funds do not have abnor- mal performance, later studies provide evidence that relative performance per- sists over both short and long horizons. 1 Carhart (1997), however, reports that accounting for momentum in individual stock returns eliminates almost all evidence of persistence among mutual funds (with one exception, the contin- ued underperformance of the worst performing funds (Berk and Xu (2004)).

    "abstract": "We document a link between U.S. Credit supply and rising personal bankruptcy rates. We exploit the exogenous variation in market contestability brought on by banking deregulation—the relaxation of entry restrictions in the 1980s and 1990s—at the state level. We ﬁnd deregulation explains at least 10% of the rise in bankruptcy rates. We also ﬁnd that deregulation leads to increased lending, lower loss rates on loans, and higher lending productivity. Our ﬁndings indicate that increased competition prompted banks to adopt sophisticated credit rating technology, allowing for new credit extension to existing and previously excluded households. THE Last Quarter Century SAW a dramatic increase in the share of U.S. Con- sumers ﬁling for personal bankruptcy, thereby seeking a discharge of their unsecured debt. In 2005, this increase led to the most comprehensive change to U.S. Bankruptcy law since 1978. While several causes for the rise in potentially signiﬁcant changes occurred during this period: banking deregulation—the relaxation of bank entry restrictions in the 1980s and 1990s—and technological change in consumer lending. Banking deregulation, by removing barriers to entry, increases credit market competition and there- fore affects the supply of credit; new screening technologies change the way loans are made, allowing for interest rates to better reﬂect underlying risk and, thus, facilitating lending to riskier borrowers.

    "abstract": "Using novel survey data, we document that individuals extrapolate from recent per- sonal experiences when forming expectations about aggregate economic outcomes. Recent locally experienced house price movements affect expectations about future U.S. House price changes and higher experienced house price volatility causes re- spondents to report a wider distribution over expected U.S. House price movements. When we exploit within-individual variation in employment status, we ﬁnd that in- dividuals who personally experience unemployment become more pessimistic about future nationwide unemployment. The extent of extrapolation is unrelated to how informative personal experiences are, is inconsistent with risk adjustment, and is more pronounced for less sophisticated individuals. Expectations Play A KEY Role IN Economic models of decision-making under uncertainty. Recent work explores empirical measures of expectations to in- form the modeling of the expectation formation process (see Barberis et al., 2015; Fuster, Laibson, and Mendel,2010). This work shows that personal ex- periences have a substantial effect on expectations of aggregate economic out- comes (see, e.g., Malmendier and Nagel,2011, 2016; Malmendier, Nagel, and Yan, 2017).

    "abstract": "I identify the effects of personal relationships on loan contracting using executive deaths and retirements at other ﬁrms as a source of exogenous variation in executive turnover. After plausibly exogenous turnover, borrowers choose lenders with which their new executives have personal relationships 4.1 times as frequently, and loans from these lenders have 20 basis points lower spreads and 12.5% larger amounts. Per- sonal relationships beneﬁt ﬁrms across loan terms, especially during macroeconomic downturns. Increased ﬁnancial ﬂexibility from personal relationships insulated ﬁrms from ﬁnancial shocks during the recent ﬁnancial crisis: they exhibited less constrained investment and were less likely to layoff employees. Coase (1937, 1988) Proposes That Valuable relationships form in long-term contracting environments subject to uncertainty and information asymmetry. Because the private loan market is subject to these conditions and long-term relationships between ﬁrms and banks are an empirical regularity, several theories and empirical tests have been developed to understand the nature of relationships between ﬁrms and banks. Theoretically, borrowers and lenders stand to gain from relational lending (Berger and Udell (1995)) if they can split the gains from monitoring cost savings, but either party might also suffer from moral hazard problems that can prevent relationships from forming (e.g., Sharpe (1990), Rajan (1992), von Thadden (2004)).

Using a policy shock that rendered AA+ and AA bonds ineligible for repo on one market only , we compare how bond prices changed across markets and rating classes around this event. When the haircut increases from 0% to 100%, bond yields increase by 39 bps to 85 bps. These estimates help us infer the magnitude of the shadow cost of capital in China. Curities.

    "abstract": "Why do ﬁrms choose high debt when they anticipate high valuations, and underper- form subsequently? We propose a theory of ﬁnancing cycles where the importance of creditors’ control rights over cash ﬂows (“pledgeability”) varies with industry liquidity. The market allows ﬁrms take on more debt when they anticipate higher future liquid- ity. However, both high anticipated liquidity and the resulting high debt limit their incentives to enhance pledgeability. This has prolonged adverse effects in a downturn. Because these effects are hard to contract upon, higher anticipated liquidity can also reduce a ﬁrm’s current access to ﬁnance. WHY DO Downturns Following Episodes OF High ﬁrm valuations result in more protracted recessions (see Krishnamurthy and Muir (2017), L´opez-Salido, Stein, and Zakrajˇsek (2017))?1 One traditional rationale is based on the idea of “debt overhang”—debt built up during the boom restricts investment and borrowing during the bust. However, if everyone knows that debt reduces in- vestment, debt holders have an incentive to write down the debt in return for a stake in the ﬁrm’s growth. For debt overhang to be a serious concern, the ﬁrm and debt holders must be unable to negotiate value-enhancing contracts. An- other view is that borrowers cannot be trusted to pursue only value-enhancing investments, even in a downturn, in which case debt overhang is needed to constrain the borrower’s investment—overhang is a second-best solution to a We are grateful for hel",

    "abstract": "For many benchmark predictor variables, short-horizon return predictability in the U.S. Stock market is local in time as short periods with signiﬁcant predictability (“pockets”) are interspersed with long periods with no return predictability . We doc- ument this result empirically using a ﬂexible time-varying parameter model that estimates predictive coefﬁcients as a nonparametric function of time and explore pos- sible explanations of this ﬁnding, including time-varying risk premia for which we ﬁnd limited support. Conversely , pockets of return predictability are consistent with a sticky expectations model in which investors slowly update their beliefs about a persistent component in the cash ﬂow process. Researchers Have Long Been Interested in the extent to which stock returns are predictable. Over the last several decades, time-varying risk pre- mia have been widely suggested as a key source of ﬂuctuations in stock prices, and many workhorse macroﬁnance models seek to exogenously generate large ﬂuctuations in discount rates on the aggregate stock market. Both welfare cal- culations and normative predictions about optimal investment strategies are often quite different in the presence of return predictability . At the same time, these ﬁndings have been met with some skepticism given a number of stud- ies that ﬁnd empirical evidence that return predictability is highly unstable, varying greatly over time and across markets and being difﬁcult to exploit out- of-sample.1 co",

    "title": "Political Connections and Corporate Bailouts",
    "abstract": "We analyze the likelihood of government bailouts of 450 politically connected firms from 35 countries during 1997–2002. Politically connected firms are significantly more likely to be bailed out than similar nonconnected firms. Additionally, politically con- nected firms are disproportionately more likely to be bailed out when the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank provides financial assistance to the firm’s home government. Further, among bailed-out firms, those that are politically connected ex- hibit significantly worse financial performance than their nonconnected peers at the time of and following the bailout. This evidence suggests that, at least in some coun- tries, political connections influence the allocation of capital through the mechanism of financial assistance when connected companies confront economic distress. Anecdotal Evidence Indicates That , at least in some countries, politically con- nected firms have preferential access to debt financing. 1 Empirical evidence supports the anecdotal evidence: Chiu and Joh (2004), Cull and Xu (2005), Faccio (2003), Johnson and Mitton (2003), and Khwaja and Mian (2005) show that politically connected (but publicly traded) firms have higher leverage ra- tios than their nonconnected peers. This evidence begs the question as to what it is about politically connected firms that makes lenders more willing to extend credit to them.

    "title": "Political Polarization Affects Households’",
    "abstract": "Political identity and partisanship are salient features of today’s society. Using deeds records and voter rolls, we show that current residents are more likely to sell their homes when opposite-party neighbors move in nearby than when unafﬁliated or same-party neighbors do. This is especially true when the new neighbors are politi- cally active, consistent with an animosity between parties mechanism. We conclude that affective polarization is not limited to purely political settings and affects one of the household’s most important ﬁnancial decisions, their home transactions. THE Importance OF Party Affiliation for voter choice was discussed as early as Campbell et al. ( 1960), but its role in nonpolitical arenas was not seriously considered until Green, Palmquist, and Schickler ( 2004), who ar- gue that “party identiﬁcation is a genuine form of social identiﬁcation.” To- day, households’ political identities correlate with everything from their cof- fee preferences to their moral worldviews (DellaPosta, Shi, and Macy ( 2015)). In consumer ﬁnance, for example, political afﬁliation shapes investor beliefs (Cookson, Engelberg, and Mullins ( 2020)), retirement portfolios (Meeuwis et al.

    "abstract": "Representation on pension fund boards by state ofﬁcials—often determined by statute decades past—is negatively related to the performance of private equity investments made by the pension fund, despite state ofﬁcials’ relatively strong ﬁnancial education and experience. Their underperformance appears to be partly driven by poor invest- ment decisions consistent with political expediency, and is also positively related to political contributions from the ﬁnance industry. Boards dominated by elected rank- and-ﬁle plan participants also underperform, but to a smaller extent and due to these trustees’ lesser ﬁnancial experience. HOW DO Politicians Affect THE Governance of the organizations with which they are associated as board members or ﬁduciaries? A large literature suggests that political connections can be extremely valuable for ﬁrms (Fisman (2001), Johnson and Mitton (2003), Faccio (2006), Cooper, Gulen, and Ovtchinnikov (2010), Duchin and Sosyura (2012), Amore and Bennedsen (2013), Goldman, Rocholl, and So (2013), Akey (2015), Acemoglu et al.

    "abstract": "We document cycles in corporate investment corresponding with the timing of na- tional elections around the world. During election years, ﬁrms reduce investment ex- penditures by an average of 4.8% relative to nonelection years, controlling for growth opportunities and economic conditions. The magnitude of the investment cycles varies with different country and election characteristics. We investigate several potential explanations and ﬁnd evidence supporting the hypothesis that political uncertainty leads ﬁrms to reduce investment expenditures until the electoral uncertainty is re- solved. These ﬁndings suggest that political uncertainty is an important channel through which the political process affects real economic outcomes. THE Relationship Between Politics and economic outcomes has a long his- hypothesized to inﬂuence real decisions is through the channel of uncertainty and instability. In particular, the incentives and uncertainties associated with possible changes in government policy or national leadership have implications for the behavior of both politicians and ﬁrms. The effects of policy uncertainty are especially relevant in light of the recent ﬁnancial crisis and recession. There is a great deal of uncertainty as to how governments will shape policy to stimu- late investment in the short run and formulate regulatory and economic policy in the long run. It has been argued that this uncertainty itself may be hindering a recovery by inducing ﬁrms to delay investme",

    "abstract": "We investigate the employment consequences of private equity buyouts. We ﬁnd ev- idence of higher job creation, on average, at the establishments operated by targets of politically connected private equity ﬁrms than at those operated by targets of nonconnected private equity ﬁrms. Consistent with an exchange of favors story, es- tablishments operated by targets of politically connected private equity ﬁrms increase employment more during election years and in states with high levels of corruption. In additional analyses, we provide evidence of speciﬁc beneﬁts experienced by tar- get ﬁrms from their political connections. Our results are robust to tests designed to mitigate selection concerns. During THE 2012 Presidential Election, the controversy around Mitt Rom- ney’s participation in Bain Capital fuelled the debate concerning the role of private equity ﬁrms. While lawmakers and labor unions often depicted pri- vate equity ﬁrms as rent-seeking investors that make proﬁts at the expense of target ﬁrms’ workers, others offered a different perspective.1 According to a Wall Street Journalarticle, for example, the White House played a crucial role during the election by encouraging the Carlyle Group, a politically connected private equity ﬁrm, to take a majority stake in a Philadelphia oil reﬁnery, allegedly “saving 850 unionized jobs.”2 Recent academic studies that reexam- ine the effect private equity has on employment at target ﬁrms conclude that Kate Holland, Joel Houston, Byou",

    "abstract": "Using cross-sectional data from the SCF and Tax Model, we show that entrepre- neurial income risk has a significant influence on portfolio choice and asset prices. We find that households with high and variable business income hold less wealth in stocks than other similarly wealthy households, although they constitute a sig- nificant fraction of the stockholding population. Similarly for nonentrepreneurs, holding stock in the firm where one works reduces the portfolio share of other common stocks. Finally, we show that adding proprietary income to a linear asset pricing model improves its performance over a similar model that includes only wage income. IN Constructing Investment Portfolios, it appears that many if not most house- holds fail to behave in a manner consistent with simple economic theory. Even among relatively wealthy households, the share of financial assets held in different asset classes varies widely, and there is evidence that among those who hold common stock, there is often little diversification (e.g., King and Leape (1987), Blume and Zeldes (1994)). We begin this paper with an empirical investigation into some of the risk factors and demographic vari- ables that might explain these cross-sectional differences in portfolio com- position. A number of previous studies focus on the level and variability of wage income growth as one of the largest sources of undiversifiable income risk.

    "abstract": "Personal projects, such as a private business or the purchase of a home, influence individuals' portfolio choice. We conduct a theoretical analysis of this influence when financial assets are required to provide liquidity to personal projects. Due to this liquidity consideration, individuals behave in a more risk-averse fashion when there is a large penalty for discontinuing or underinvesting in the final stages of the projects. In addition, using data from the 1995 Survey of Consumer Finances, we find that households that are saving to invest in their own businesses or in their own homes indeed have significantly safer financial portfolios. A Large Portion OF Private Assets are invested in personal illiquid projects. These are projects that must be partly self-financed and are costly to sell. According to the 1995 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), residential hous- ing and capital invested in unincorporated businesses account for 41.2 per- cent and 19.1 percent, respectively, of household wealth.' In this paper, we study the impact of these personal illiquid projects on individuals' portfolios of financial assets. Personal projects influence portfolio choice in two ways. First, financial assets can be used to provide diversification against bad outcomes of personal projects. This interaction is well recognized in the lit- erature as it emanates from standard portfolio theory. Second, financial as- sets can be used to provide liquidity to personal projects when the timing of",

    "abstract": "We study portfolio choice when labor income and dividends are cointegrated. Econom- ically plausible calibrations suggest young investors should take substantial short positions in the stock market. Because of cointegration the young agent’s human capital effectively becomes “stock-like.” However, for older agents with shorter times- to-retirement, cointegration does not have sufficient time to act, and thus their hu- man capital becomes more “bond-like.” Together, these effects create hump-shaped life-cycle portfolio holdings, consistent with empirical observation. These results hold even when asset return predictability is accounted for. THE Optimal Portfolio Choice problem over the life cycle has received consider- able attention in political, financial, and academic circles. Yet, in spite of the vast work on this topic, there is still much disagreement across empirical ob- servation, conventional wisdom, and the predictions of most of the academic literature. While the level of stock market participation has increased significantly over the decades, several studies report that risky asset holdings have typically been low at young ages, and then either increasing or hump-shaped over the life cycle (see, for example, Ameriks and Zeldes (2001), Faig and Shum (2002), Heaton and Lucas (2000), and Poterba and Samwick (2001)).

The likelihood of explicit performance-based incentives is positively correlated with the intensity of agency conﬂicts, as proxied by the advisor’s clientele dispersion, its afﬁliations in the ﬁnancial industry, and its ownership structure. Investor sophistication and the threat of dismissal in outsourced funds serve as substitutes for explicit performance- based incentives.

    "abstract": "Finance theory can be used to form informative prior beliefs in financial decision making. This paper approaches portfolio selection in a Bayesian framework that incorporates a prior degree of belief in an asset pricing model. Sample evidence on home bias and value and size effects is evaluated from an asset-allocation perspec- tive. U.S. Investors' belief in the domestic Capm must be very strong to justify the home bias observed in their equity holdings. The same strong prior belief results in large and stable optimal positions in the Fama-French book-to-market portfolio in combination with the market since the 1940s. Finance Theory HAS Produced A Variety of models that attempt to provide some insight into the environment in which financial decisions are made. How should these models be used by financial decision makers? Empirical finance typically approaches a theoretical model by testing whether its im- plications are supported by the data. Based on the result of a hypothesis test, the model is either rejected or not rejected. It is not clear what such an outcome implies about the usefulness of the model for decision making. If the model is not rejected, should it be used as the truth? And if it is rejected, should it be discarded as worthless? Such a simplistic approach, based solely on the result of a hypothesis test, fails to capture many aspects of both the model and the data that could potentially be useful to a decision maker.

    "title": "Precautionary Savings with Risky Assets: When",
    "abstract": "U.S. Industrial ﬁrms invest heavily in noncash, risky ﬁnancial assets such as cor- porate debt, equity, and mortgage-backed securities. Risky assets represent 40% of ﬁrms’ ﬁnancial portfolios, or 6% of total book assets. We present a formal model to assess the optimality of this behavior. Consistent with the model, risky assets are concentrated in ﬁnancially unconstrained ﬁrms holding large ﬁnancial portfolios, are held by poorly governed ﬁrms, and are discounted by 13% to 22% compared to safe assets. We conclude that this activity represents an unregulated asset management industry of more than $1.5 trillion, questioning the traditional boundaries of nonﬁ- nancial ﬁrms. A KEY Assumption IN STUDIESof corporate cash holdings is that industrial ﬁrms invest in actual cash or risk-free, near-cash securities. Recent anecdotal evi- dence in the press, however, suggests that corporate treasuries have consider- ably broadened the scope of securities in which they invest. For example, the article “Google’s Latest Launch: Its Own Trading Floor,” published inBusiness Week Onlineon May 27, 2010, reports that “Google, it turns out, has launched a trading ﬂoor to manage its $26.5 billion in cash and short-term investments . . .

    "abstract": "This paper studies predatory trading, trading that induces and/or exploits the need of other investors to reduce their positions. We show that if one trader needs to sell, others also sell and subsequently buy back the asset. This leads to price overshooting and a reduced liquidation value for the distressed trader. Hence, the market is illiquid when liquidity is most needed. Further, a trader profits from triggering another trader’s crisis, and the crisis can spill over across traders and across markets. Large Traders Fear A Forced Liquidation , especially if their need to liquidate is known by other traders. For example, hedge funds with (nearing) margin calls may need to liquidate, and this could be known to certain counterparties such as the bank financing the trade. Similarly, traders who use portfolio insurance, stop loss orders, or other risk management strategies can be known to liquidate in response to price drops; a short-seller may need to cover his position if the price increases significantly or if his share is recalled (i.e., a “short squeeze”); certain institutions have an incentive to liquidate bonds that are downgraded or in default; and, intermediaries who take on large derivative positions must hedge them by trading the underlying security. A forced liquidation is often very costly since it is associated with large price impact and low liquidity. We provide a new framework for studying the strategic interaction among large traders who have market impact. Tr",

    "title": "Predictable Financial Crises",
    "abstract": "Using historical data on postwar ﬁnancial crises around the world, we show that the combination of rapid credit and asset price growth over the prior three years, whether in the nonﬁnancial business or the household sector, is associated with a 40% proba- bility of entering a ﬁnancial crisis within the next three years. This compares with a roughly 7% probability in normal times, when neither credit nor asset price growth is elevated. Our evidence challenges the view that ﬁnancial crises are unpredictable “bolts from the sky” and supports the Kindleberger-Minsky view that crises are the byproduct of predictable, boom-bust credit cycles. This predictability favors policies that lean against incipient credit-market booms. A Central Issue IN THE Study of macroeconomic stability is the predictabil- ity of ﬁnancial crises. An important line of thought holds that crises are largely unpredictable. For example, each of the three principal policymak- ers in the 2008 U.S. ﬁnancial crisis, Hank Paulson, Tim Geithner, and Ben Bernanke, has taken this position. 1 Similarly, Gorton ( 2012, p. 42) argues that “crises are sudden, unpredictable events.” This view is supported by the- ories that see crises as due to sunspot equilibria (Cole and Kehoe ( 2000), nancial Frictions (Grant no.

    "title": "Predictable Investment Horizons and Wealth",
    "abstract": "This study analyzes the distribution of investment horizons in a large, proprietary panel of all shareholders in one no-load mutual fund family. A proportional hazards model shows that there are observable shareholder characteristics that enable the fund to predict reliably on the day each account is opened whether the account will be short term or long term. Simulations show that the liquidity costs imposed on the fund by the expected short-term shareholders are significantly greater than those imposed by the expected long-term shareholders. Combining these results, the analysis argues that mutual funds do not provide equitable liquidity-risk insurance. Investors Ostensibly Receive NO - OR LOW -cost Liquidity from open-end mutual funds. However, their trades in fund shares may force the fund to make costly transactions in its portfolio. Because the fund pays these expenses, sharehold- ers who trade implicitly impose the financial burden of their liquidity demands onto others in the fund. If shareholders differentially generate fund-level costs, there will be a wealth transfer from the low-cost shareholders to the high-cost shareholders. The purpose of this article is to explore shareholders’ demanded liquidity and its pricing in open-end mutual funds. The first part of the inquiry asks whether shareholders’ liquidity demands can be predicted. The second part examines whether shareholders’ predicted demand for liquidity is proportional to the liquidity costs they bear in the",

Theo- retically , distributional effects of better statistical technology can come from greater ﬂexibility to uncover structural relationships or from triangulation of otherwise ex- cluded characteristics. Using data on U.S. Mortgages, we predict default using tra- ditional and machine learning models. We ﬁnd that Black and Hispanic borrowers are disproportionately less likely to gain from the introduction of machine learning. In a simple equilibrium credit market model, machine learning increases disparity in rates between and within groups, with these changes attributable primarily to greater ﬂexibility .

    "title": "Predicting Returns with Managerial Decision",
    "abstract": "Many studies find that aggregate managerial decision variables, such as aggregate these findings may be driven by an aggregate time-series version of Schultz’s (2003, Journal of Finance 58, 483–517) pseudo market-timing bias. Using standard simula- tion techniques, we find that the bias is much too small to account for the observed predictive power of the equity share in new issues, corporate investment plans, insider trading, dividend initiations, or the maturity of corporate debt issues. Equity Market Timing IS THE Tendency OF Firms to issue equity before low eq- uity market returns. In contrast, pseudo market timing, as recently defined by Schultz (2003), is the tendency of firms to issue equity following high returns. In small samples, pseudo market timing can give the appearance of genuine market timing. Consider an extreme example of pure pseudo market timing with only two returns. If the first return is high, equity issues rise; if the first return is low, equity issues fall. The first return can be mechanically explained ex post: Relatively low equity issues precede a high first return and relatively high equity issues precede a low first return. Even though the returns are ran- dom, equity issues “predict” in-sample returns more often than not. In a provocative article, Butler, Grullon, and Weston (2005) argue that an aggregate version of the pseudo market-timing bias explains why the variable studied in Baker and Wurgler (2000), namely, the equity share in new equit",

This approach aggregates information contained in the history of price-dividend ratios and dividend growth rates to predict future returns and dividend growth rates. We ﬁnd that returns and dividend growth rates are predictable withR 2 values ranging from 8.2% to 8.9% for returns and 13.9% to 31.6% for dividend growth rates.

WE Propose A Latent VARIABLESapproach within a present-value model to esti- mate the time series of expected returns and expected dividend growth rates of the aggregate stock market. Speciﬁcally, we treat conditional expected returns and expected dividend growth rates as latent variables that follow an exoge- nously speciﬁed time-series model, and we combine this model with a Campbell and Shiller (1988) present-value model to derive the implied dynamics of the price-dividend ratio.

    "title": "Predictive Systems: Living with Imperfect",
    "abstract": "We develop a framework for estimating expected returns—a predictive system—that allows predictors to be imperfectly correlated with the conditional expected return. When predictors are imperfect, the estimated expected return depends on past returns in a manner that hinges on the correlation between unexpected returns and innova- tions in expected returns. We find empirically that prior beliefs about this correlation, which is most likely negative, substantially affect estimates of expected returns as well as various inferences about predictability, including assessments of a predictor’s usefulness. Compared to standard predictive regressions, predictive systems deliver different expected returns with higher estimated precision. Many Studies IN Finance analyze comovement between expected asset returns and various observable quantities, or “predictors.” A question of frequent in- terest is how xt, a vector of predictors observed at time t, is related to µt, the conditional expected return defined in the equation rt+1 = µt + ut+1, (1) where rt+1 denotes the stock return from timet to timet + 1, and the unexpected return ut+1 has mean zero conditional on all information available at time t. One approach to modeling expected returns is to use a “predictive regression” in which r t+1 is regressed on xt and the expected return is given by µt = a + b′xt, where a and b denote the regression’s intercept and slope coefficients. 1 This were received from the audiences at the Fall 2006 N",

    "title": "Presidential Address, Committing to Commit:",
    "abstract": "In legal systems with expensive or ineffective contract enforcement, it is difficult to induce lenders to enforce debt contracts. If lenders do not enforce, borrowers will have incentives to misbehave. Lenders have incentives to enforce given bad news when debt is short-term and subject to runs caused by externalities across lenders. Lenders will not undo these externalities by negotiation. The required number of lenders increases with enforcement costs. A very high enforcement cost can exceed the ex ante incentive benefit of enforcement. Removing lenders’ right to immediately enforce their debt with a “bail-in” can improve the ex ante incentives of borrowers. HOW Should Borrowers AND Lenders structure financial contracts when contract enforcement is ineffective and costly? If contractual remedies do not benefit lenders, then they may not enforce their contracts. In emerging markets and in economies making the transition to capitalism, where the financial benefit from legal enforcement may be small, this is a much-discussed problem. Known as the problem of lender passivity, it describes the situation in which lenders do not go to bankruptcy court after a borrower defaults (see Kornai (1979), Mitchell (1993), and Dewatripont and Maskin (1995)). I argue that short-term debt can be an effective solution to this problem. Borrowing with large amounts of short-term debt can lead to the threat of runs on firms, because there may be an externality across lenders. This exter- nality a",

    "title": "Presidential Address: Asset Price Dynamics with Slow&#x2010;Moving Capital",
    "abstract": "I describe asset price dynamics caused by the slow movement of investment capital to trading opportunities. The pattern of price responses to supply or demand shocks typically involves a sharp reaction to the shock and a subsequent and more extended reversal. The amplitude of the immediate price impact and the pattern of the sub- sequent recovery can reﬂect institutional impediments to immediate trade, such as search costs for trading counterparties or time to raise capital by intermediaries. I discuss special impediments to capital formation during the recent ﬁnancial crisis that caused asset price distortions, which subsided afterward. After presenting ex- amples of price reactions to supply shocks in normal market settings, I offer a simple illustrative model of price dynamics associated with slow-moving capital due to the presence of inattentive investors. I Address THE IMPLICATIONSfor asset price dynamics of the apparent slow move- ment of investment capital to trading opportunities. The arrival of new capital to an investment opportunity can be delayed by fractions of a second in some markets, for example an electronic limit-order-book market for equities, or by months in other markets, such as that for catastrophe risk insurance. Accord- ingly, prices respond to supply or demand shocks with a sharp reaction because of the relatively small subset of capital (and thus risk-bearing capacity) that is immediately available to absorb a shock on short notice.

    "abstract": "Optimal dynamic capital structure choice is fundamentally a problem of commitment. In a standard trade-off setting with shareholder-debtholder agency conﬂicts, full com- mitment counterfactually predicts the ﬁrm would rely almost exclusively on debt ﬁ- nancing. Conversely, absent commitment a Modigliani-Miller-like value irrelevance and policy indeterminacy result holds. Thus, the content of dynamic trade-off theory must depend on the commitment technology. In this context, collateral is valuable as a low-cost commitment device. Because ex ante optimal commitments are likely to be suboptimal ex post, observed capital structure dynamics will exhibit hysteresis and depart signiﬁcantly from standard predictions. Namics remain elusive. The traditional trade-off and pecking-order theoreti- cal frameworks provide primarily static predictions that are unable to explain much of the observed cross-sectional and time-series variation in leverage. Capital structure is not static, but rather evolves over time as an aggregation of sequential decisions in which shareholders have an incentive to act strategi- cally, maximizing the share price at the potential expense of creditors. I analyze a setting in which investors anticipate this behavior and set prices accordingly. Building on related work, I demonstrate that when trade is frequent, this price feedback is sufﬁcient to destroyall beneﬁts from leverage. Optimal dynamic capital structure thus becomes, fundamentally, a commitment problem.",

    "abstract": "Discount-rate variation is the central organizing question of current asset-pricing re- search. I survey facts, theories, and applications. Previously, we thought returns were unpredictable, with variation in price-dividend ratios due to variation in expected cashﬂows. Now it seems all price-dividend variation corresponds to discount-rate variation. We also thought that the cross-section of expected returns came from the Capm. Now we have a zoo of new factors. I categorize discount-rate theories based on central ingredients and data sources. Incorporating discount-rate variation affects ﬁnance applications, including portfolio theory, accounting, cost of capital, capital structure, compensation, and macroeconomics. Asset Prices Should Equal expected discounted cashﬂows. Forty years ago, Eugene Fama (1970) argued that the expected part, “testing market efﬁciency,” I start with facts:how discount rates vary over time and across assets. I turn to theory:why discount rates vary. I attempt a categorization based on central assumptions and links to data, analogous to Fama’s “weak,” “semi-strong,” and “strong” forms of efﬁciency. Finally, I point to some applications, which I think will be strongly inﬂuenced by our new understanding of discount rates. In each case, I have more questions than answers.

Seven distinct measures of trading friction are computed from transactions data for 1,706 Nyse/amse stocks and 2,184 Nasdaq stocks. The measures provide insights into the magnitude of trading costs, the importance of informational versus real frictions, and the role of market structure. The degree to which the various measures are associated with each other and with trading characteristics of stocks is examined.

    "abstract": "Beliefs of professional forecasters are benchmarked against those of a Bayesian econometrician BE who is learning about the unknown dynamics of the bond risk factors. Consistent with rational Bayesian learning, the forecast errors of individual professionals and BE are comparably predictable over the business cycle. The secular and cyclical patterns of professionals’ forecasts relative to those of BE are explored in depth. Inconsistent with many models with be- lief dispersion, the relationship between professionals’ yield disagreement and their matched disagreements about macroeconomic fundamentals is very weak.

And Q2—what guid- ance do historical bond yields and professional surveys provide for modeling investors’ belief formation? This exploration is premised on three considerations. (i) In general, disper- sion of beliefs is a source of risk in bond markets and bonds are not priced as if one is in an economy of homogeneous agents holding an average belief (Jouini and Napp ( 2007)). (ii) Outside of knife-edge cases, the beliefs of each individual investor will differ from those of an observer econometrician who is modeling the data-generating process (DGP) for equilibrium bond prices (e.g., Xiong and Yan ( 2009)).

Search costs for retail investors lead to price dispersion in the secondary market, while the price for institutional investors is infinitely elastic. Because retail distribution capac- ity is assumed to be limited for each underwriter-dealer, Bertrand competition breaks down in the primary market and new issues are underpriced in equilibrium. Syn- dicates emerge in which underwriters bid symmetrically, with quantities allocated internally to efficiently utilize retail distribution capacity. Underwriters AND Dealers Appear TO Compete vigorously for new security issues, and yet also appear to earn high profits in this business. What value are they generating that warrants high compensation? Are there obstacles that keep this value from flowing through to security issuers, despite apparently fierce competition in the market for these financial services? The model in this paper combines three elements: a lack of price transparency in the secondary market, limited retail distribution capacity, and Bertrand com- petition in the primary market.

    "abstract": "This paper examines the implications of market microstructure for asset pri- cing. I argue that asset pricing ignores the central fact that asset prices evolve in markets. Markets provide liquidity and price discovery, and I argue that asset pricing models need to be recast in broader terms to incorporate the transactions costs of liquidity and the risks of price discovery. I argue that symmetric information-based asset pricing models do not work because they assume that the underlying problems of liquidity and price discovery have been solved. I develop an asymmetric information asset pricing model that incorporates these effects. This Paper Examines THE Implications of market microstructure for asset pricing. Microstructure implications have been largely missing from the asset pricing literature. Such an omission is unimportant if asset pricing models work well in the sense of explaining the observed behavior of asset prices, but this is not the case. The proliferation of anomalies, momentum, and the changing cast of factors needed to explain even partially the behavior of asset prices all suggest that success is not yet within our grasp. I will argue in this paper that asset pricing ignores the central fact that market microstructure focuses on: Asset prices evolve in markets. Markets have two important functions-liquidity and price discovery-and these functions are important for asset pricing.1 I will link these two concepts to our more basic constructs of risk and expect",

It proposes a new resilience measure, and contrasts micro- and macro-resilience. It also classiﬁes macroﬁnance models in ﬁrst- (log-linearized) and second-generation models, and links the important themes of macroﬁnance to resilience. Macrofinance , Which Examines HOW Finance impacts the macroecon- omy , gained renewed prominence after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). Its roots, however, go far back in the history of economic thought. Indeed, arguably many eminent economists throughout history have been interested in the re- lationship between the macroeconomy and ﬁnance. Most fundamentally , macroﬁnance is concerned with macroeconomic growth and efﬁciency as well as with stability of the ﬁnancial sector. The literature encompasses a wide variety of models—mostly in dynamic general equilibrium settings—and empirical analyses. In most macroﬁnance models with ﬁnancial frictions and heterogeneous agents, the distribution of wealth matters, also because the wealth shares are important state variables. Inequality is an important policy concern on its own but also since it interacts with growth and stability . Macroﬁnance is a “broad church” that touches on most subﬁelds of economics and ﬁnance.

This emerging ﬁeld recog- nizes that people observe and talk to each other. A key, underexploited building block of social economics and ﬁnance is social transmission bias: systematic directional shift in signals or ideas induced by social transactions. I use ﬁve “fables” (models) to illus- trate the novelty and scope of the transmission bias approach, and offer several emer- gent themes. For example, social transmission bias compounds recursively, which can help explain booms, bubbles, return anomalies, and swings in economic sentiment. This Address Discusses A NEW intellectual paradigm, which I call social eco- nomics and ﬁnance—the study of how social interaction affects economic out- comes. In standard analyses of economic behavior, people interact only imper- sonally via trading orders and observation of market price. A missing chapter in our understanding of ﬁnance consists of the social processes that shape economic thinking and behavior. Social economics and ﬁnance recognizes that people observe each other and talk to each other, where talking includes written text and social media.

    "title": "Presidential Address: Sophisticated Investors and Market Efficiency",
    "abstract": "Stock-market trading is increasingly dominated by sophisticated professionals, as opposed to individual investors. Will this trend ultimately lead to greater market efficiency? I consider two complicating factors. The first is crowding—the fact that, for a wide range of “unanchored” strategies, an arbitrageur cannot know how many of his peers are simultaneously entering the same trade. The second is leverage— when an arbitrageur chooses a privately optimal leverage ratio, he may create a fire- sale externality that raises the likelihood of a severe crash. In some cases, capital regulation may be helpful in dealing with the latter problem. IN THE Last 20 Years or so, there have been profound changes in the way that money is managed. One indicator of these changes is the rapid growth of the hedge fund industry, whose assets on a global basis have gone from $39 bil- lion at year-end 1990 to $1.93 trillion as of the second quarter of 2008. 1 Hedge funds are commonly thought of as the prototypical sophisticated investors, for a couple of reasons. First, many of their investment strategies are based on extensive quantitative modeling, much of which has its roots in academic re- search in finance. 2 Second, hedge funds often implement these strategies in an aggressively leveraged fashion. The growth of hedge funds is part of a broader trend toward professional asset management. French (2008) documents that, in the stock market, indi- vidual investors have been largely supplanted by",

    "abstract": "In this address, I discuss differences across investor and manager motivations for considering sustainable ﬁnance— value versus values motivations—and how these differences contribute to misunderstandings about environmental, social, and gover- which I suggest. While Sustainable Finance HAS Been drawing increased attention from institutional and retail investors, regulators, politicians, corporate leaders, and employees, alike, there is no clear consensus on the meaning of sustainable ﬁ- nance or the acronyms associated with it—ESG (environmental, social, and governance), SRI (socially or sustainably responsible investing), and CSR (cor- porate social responsibility). The lack of clarity on the meaning of these terms leads to misunderstandings about how they affect investors, corporations, and asset markets, which can make it difﬁcult to interpret evidence on investment behavior and to design related regulations. In this address, I argue that the misunderstandings arise from differences in investors’ and managers’ moti- vations. In particular, I argue much of the confusion is due to differences in whether motivation arises fromvalue or values, that is, from regarding the comments, I would like to thank the editor, Antoinette Schoar, as well as Reena Aggarwal, Andres Almazan, Natasha Burns, Eli Fich, Stuart Gillan, John Graham, John Grifﬁn, Andy Koch, Jeff Netter, Clemens Sialm, Rick Sias, Sheridan Titman, Parth Venkat, and Qifei Zhu.

    "abstract": "To produce signiﬁcant net present value, an entrepreneur has to differentiate her enterprise from the ordinary. To take collaborators with her, she needs to have substantial ownership, and thus ﬁnancing. But it is hard to raise ﬁnance against differentiated assets. So an entrepreneur has to commit to undertake a second transformation, standardization, that will make the human capital in the ﬁrm, including her own, replaceable, so that outside ﬁnanciers obtain control rights that will allow them to be repaid. A vibrant stock market helps the entrepreneur commit to these two transformations. The nature of ﬁrms and ﬁnancing are intimately linked. ONE OF THE CORNERSTONESof modern corporate ﬁnance is the Modigliani–Miller Theorem, which essentially says that, in a world where investors can borrow and lend as easily as corporations, the value of a ﬁrm is determined by the present discounted value of its expected cash ﬂows, and not by how these cash ﬂows are allocated to various claimholders. A ﬁrm’s capital structure is therefore irrelevant to its value, or taken literally, much of what corporate ﬁnance spends its time on is of second-order importance. Corporate ﬁnance researchers have spent the years sinceModigliani and Miller (1958) trying to prove the value of their ﬁeld by challenging one as- sumption after another of the near-perfect world that Modigliani and Miller postulate.

    "abstract": "I compare the fees, expenses, and trading costs society pays to invest in the U.S. Stock market with an estimate of what would be paid if everyone invested passively. Averaging over 1980–2006, I find investors spend 0.67% of the aggregate value of the market each year searching for superior returns. Society’s capitalized cost of price discovery is at least 10% of the current market cap. Under reasonable assumptions, the typical investor would increase his average annual return by 67 basis points over the 1980–2006 period if he switched to a passive market portfolio. HOW Much DO Investors Spend TRYINGto beat the market? To answer this question, I start by estimating the total amount society spends to invest. I measure four components: the fees and expenses investors pay for mutual funds, including open-end funds, closed-end funds, and exchange-traded funds; the investment management costs of institutional investors; the fees investors pay for hedge funds and funds of hedge funds; and the costs all investors pay to trade. I then compare these costs to what society would pay if all investors held a passive market portfolio. The difference is the cost of active investing. Consider a small but representative investor whose initial investment strat- egy is the value-weight combination of all investors’ strategies. Because the value-weight combination of all investors’ portfolios is the market portfolio, the representative investor’s initial return is the gross return on the market",

    "abstract": "We develop a theory in which ﬁnancial (and other professional services) ﬁrms de- sign career structures to “sell” prestigious jobs to qualiﬁed candidates. Firms create less prestigious entry-level jobs, which serve as currency for employees to pay for the right to compete for the more prestigious jobs. In optimal career structures, entry- level employees (“associates”) compete for better-paid and more prestigious positions (“managing directors” or “partners”). The model provides new implications relating job prestige to compensation, employment, competition, and the size of the ﬁnan- cial sector. “Among brokerage houses, there is a well-deﬁned hierarchy of prestige, with investment banking powerhouses such as Goldman Sachs or Merrill Lynch considered high status and more regional and specialized brokerage houses considered lower status. Being an analyst at a high-status broker- age house is typically a better job (e.g., higher compensation and prestige) than being one at a low-status counterpart.” (Hong and Kubik (2003)) Some Sectors OF THE Financial industry—such as investment banking—show a clear prestige hierarchy among ﬁrms (Hayes (1971), John- son and Miller (1988), Podolny (1993), Podolny and Phillips (1996), Hong and Kubik (2003), Bidwell et al.

    "abstract": "We study price discovery in municipal bonds, an important OTC market. As in mar- kets for consumer goods, prices “rise faster than they fall.” Round-trip proﬁts to dealers on retail trades increase in rising markets but do not decrease in falling markets. Further, effective half-spreads increase or decrease more when movements in fundamentals favor dealers. Yield spreads relative to Treasuries also adjust with asymmetric speed in rising and falling markets. Finally, intraday price dispersion is asymmetric in rising and falling markets, as consumer search theory would predict. IN A Wide Variety OF Consumer Markets , prices for retail goods rise faster than they fall.1 This asymmetric price adjustment, referred to as “rockets and feathers,” is generally understood by economists to be inconsistent with perfect competition between sellers. Sellers appear to exploit local market power due to the search frictions that their customers face. We document asymmetric price adjustment in a major over-the-counter (OTC) ﬁnancial market using a comprehensive sample of all trades in mu- nicipal bonds over a 5-year period. We provide evidence that the asymmetric price adjustment is associated with opportunistic timing by the broker-dealers who intermediate trades in the market. Movements in fundamentals that in- crease spreads earned by broker-dealers are reﬂected quickly in prices, while prices respond more slowly to changes that reduce their spreads.

    "title": "Price Discovery in the U.S. Treasury Market:",
    "abstract": "We examine the role of price discovery in the U.S. Treasury market through the em- pirical relationship between orderflow, liquidity, and the yield curve. We find that orderflow imbalances (excess buying or selling pressure) account for up to 26% of the day-to-day variation in yields on days without major macroeconomic announcements. The effect of orderflow on yields is permanent and strongest when liquidity is low. All of the evidence points toward an important role of price discovery in understanding the behavior of the yield curve. THE USE OF Riskless Interest Rates Permeates virtually every facet of economics and finance. It is therefore critical to understand the behavior of the term structure of riskless interest rates, or the yield curve, which gives the mapping between the maturity of a riskless loan and its rate. Much of the term structure literature focuses on factor models in which, at each date, the yields on all bonds with different maturities are determined by the realizations of a few common factors (e.g., Vasicek (1977); Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1985)). The consensus is that more than one, but not many more than three factors capture the shape and day-to-day variation of the yield curve well. Although these factors are typically not uniquely identified, it is common to think of them as the level, slope, and curvature of the yield curve (e.g., Litterman and Scheinkman (1991)). Economists are ultimately interested in understanding why and how the yield curve ch",

    "title": "Price Discovery without Trading: Evidence",
    "abstract": "We analyze the contribution to price discovery of market and limit orders by high- frequency traders (HFTs) and non-HFTs. While market orders have a larger individ- ual price impact, limit orders are far more numerous. This results in price discovery occurring predominantly through limit orders. HFTs submit the bulk of limit orders and these limit orders provide most of the price discovery. Submissions of limit or- ders and their contribution to price discovery fall with volatility due to changes in HFTs’ behavior. Consistent with adverse selection arising from faster reactions to public information, HFTs’ informational advantage is partially explained by public information. According TO THE Traditional View of price discovery, trades reveal investors’ private information while market makers’ quotes reﬂect public information (see, e.g., Glosten and Milgrom, 1985; Kyle, 1985). Most stock exchanges and ﬁnancial markets have evolved into limit order books where there are no des- ignated market makers and limit orders represent the bulk of activity. The- oretical models of limit order books study informed traders’ choice between market orders and limit orders. The market/limit order choice of informed and uninformed investors determines the nature of price discovery and adverse selection. In this paper, we use regulatory data that enable the classiﬁcation of limit orders and trades by high-frequency traders (HFTs) and non-HFTs to systematically quantify the contribution to price",

    "abstract": "This study shows that past trading volume provides an important link between \"momentum\" and \"value\" strategies. Specifically, we find that firms with high (low) past turnover ratios exhibit many glamour (value) characteristics, earn lower (higher) future returns, and have consistently more negative (positive) earnings surprises over the next eight quarters. Past trading volume also predicts both the magnitude and persistence of price momentum. Specifically, price momentum ef- fects reverse over the next five years, and high (low) volume winners (losers) ex- perience faster reversals. Collectively, our findings show that past volume helps to reconcile intermediate-horizon \"underreaction\" and long-horizon \"overreaction\" effects. Financial Academics AND Practitioners have long recognized that past trading is little agreement on how volume information should be handled and inter- preted. Even less is known about how past trading volume interacts with past returns in the prediction of future stock returns. Stock returns and trading volume are jointly determined by the same market dynamics, and are inextricably linked in theory (e.g., Blume, Easley, and O'Hara (1994)). Yet prior empirical studies have generally accorded them separate treatment. In this study, we investigate the usefulness of trading volume in predict- ing cross-sectional returns for various price momentum portfolios. The study is organized into two parts.

    "title": "Price Pressure around Mergers",
    "abstract": "This paper examines the trading behavior of professional investors around 2,130 merg- ers announced between 1994 and 2000. We find considerable support for the existence of price pressure around mergers caused by uninformed shifts in excess demand, but that these effects are short-lived, consistent with the notion that short-run demand curves for stocks are not perfectly elastic. We estimate that nearly half of the negative announcement period stock price reaction for acquirers in stock-financed mergers re- flects downward price pressure caused by merger arbitrage short selling, suggesting that previous estimates of merger wealth effects are biased downward. Traditional Event Studies estimate wealth effects associated with corporate actions, such as mergers, by implicitly assuming that excess demand curves for stocks are perfectly elastic. As a result, measured abnormal returns are generally attributed to the underlying event. For example, it has been well doc- umented that acquiring companies that use their stock as the merger consider- ation experience announcement period abnormal returns between −2 percent and −3 percent. Conversely, cash acquirers experience flat to slightly posi- tive abnormal returns (see Travlos (1987) and Andrade, Mitchell, and Stafford (2001)). The negative stock price reaction to stock-financed mergers is often taken as support for information-based theories of financial policy (Myers and Majluf (1984)) and investment policy (Jensen (1986) and Shlei",

    "abstract": "This paper studies an overlapping generations model with multiple securities and heterogeneously informed agents. The model produces multiple equilibria, including highly volatile equilibria that can exhibit strong or weak correlations between as- set returns—even when asset supplies and future dividends are uncorrelated across assets. Less informed agents rationally behave like trend-followers, while better in- formed agents follow contrarian strategies. Trading volume has a hump-shaped re- lation with information precision and is positively correlated with absolute price changes. Finally, accurate information increases the volatility and correlation of stock returns in the highly volatile, strongly correlated equilibrium. There IS Mounting Evidence of both trend-following and contrarian behavior among various investor groups in recent empirical studies. Trend-followers buy assets upon price appreciation and sell them upon depreciation, while contrar- ians trade in the opposite way. Such trading behavior is found in both domes- tic and international markets. Moreover, prices in these markets are found to vary much more than the stocks’ fundamental values. Indeed in some markets, prices exhibit common movements that are hard to explain by movements in the fundamentals.

Voting to remove an ATP increases both the takeover probability and the takeover premium, that is, there is no evidence of a trade-off between premiums and takeover probabilities. We provide causal esti- mates based on shareholder proposals to remove ATPs and address the endogenous selection of targets through bounding techniques. The positive premium effect in less protected ﬁrms is driven by better bidder-target matching and merger synergies. Anti -takeover Provisions (atps) Such as staggered boards, dual-class shares, poison pills, and similar governance mechanisms have been found to affect ﬁrm value (e.g., Gompers, Ishii, and Metrick ( 2003), Cuñat, Giné, and Guadalupe ( 2012)).1 In the context of the takeover debate, proponents argue that ATPs create value by allowing managers to negotiate a higher price in the event of a hostile bid and encouraging more long-term investment (Stein (1988), Harris ( 1990)). However, they may also reduce or delay the possibility of a takeover (Ryngaert ( 1988), Pound ( 1987), Malatesta and Walkling ( 1988), Comment and Schwert ( 1995), Karpoff, Schonlau, and Wehrly ( 2017)).

We ﬁnd a strong correlation between ﬁnancial literacy and behavior. Bank accounts only for those with limited education or ﬁnancial literacy. In contrast, small subsidies greatly increase demand. A follow-up survey conﬁrms these ﬁndings, demonstrating that newly opened accounts remain open and in use 2 years after the intervention. Financial Development IS Widely recognized as an important determinant of economic growth, with a large literature examining the determinants of the supply of banking and ﬁnancial intermediation services (Levine (2005)). Yet the determinants of the demand for ﬁnancial services are much less well understood, particularly in emerging market countries. An important feature of emerging markets is the size of the informal sector. Recent estimates place the size of the informal economy at 14% of GDP in China, 23% in Indonesia, and 24% in India, against 8% in the United States (Buehn and Schneider (2009)).

    "title": "Pricing Model Performance and the Two-Pass",
    "abstract": "Over the years, many asset pricing studies have employed the sample cross-sectional regression (CSR) R2 as a measure of model performance. We derive the asymptotic dis- tribution of this statistic and develop associated model comparison tests, taking into account the impact of model misspeciﬁcation on the variability of the CSR estimates. We encounter several examples of large R2 differences that are not statistically sig- niﬁcant. A version of the intertemporal capital asset pricing model (capm) exhibits the best overall performance, followed by the Fama–French three-factor model. Inter- estingly, the performance of prominent consumption CAPMs is sensitive to variations in experimental design. THE Traditional Empirical Methodology for exploring asset pricing models en- tails estimation of asset betas (systematic risk measures) from time-series fac- tor model regressions, followed by estimation of risk premia via cross-sectional regressions (CSRs) of asset returns on the estimated betas. In the classic anal- ysis of the capital asset pricing model (capm) by Fama and MacBeth ( 1973), a CSR is run each month, with inference ultimately based on the time-series mean and standard error of the monthly risk premium estimates.

    "abstract": "We propose a new asset pricing framework in which all securities’ signals predict each individual return. While the literature focuses on securities’ own-signal pre- dictability, assuming equal strength across securities, our framework includes cross- predictability—leading to three main results. First, we derive the optimal strategy in closed form. It consists of eigenvectors of a “prediction matrix,” which we call “princi- pal portfolios.” Second, we decompose the problem into alpha and beta, yielding opti- mal strategies with, respectively, zero and positive factor exposure. Third, we provide a new test of asset pricing models. Empirically, principal portfolios deliver signiﬁcant out-of-sample alphas to standard factors in several data sets. THE Starting Point FOR Much of asset pricing is a signal, Si,t, that proxies for the conditional expected return for a security i at time t. In the context of an equilibrium asset pricing model, Si,t may represent the conditional beta with respect to the market (or the pricing kernel). Alternatively, Si,t may be a pre- dictor that is agnostic of equilibrium considerations, such as each asset’s val- uation ratio or its recent price momentum. Standard analyses—for example, evaluating characteristic-sorted portfolios or asset pricing tests in the spirit of Gibbons, Ross, and Shanken ( 1989)—focus on own-asset predictive signals; that is, the association between Si,t a n dt h er e t u r no n l yo na s s e ti, Ri,t+1.

    "title": "Private Benefits of Control, Ownership, and the",
    "abstract": "This paper investigates how a foreign firm’s decision to cross-list on a U.S. Stock exchange is related to the consumption of private benefits of control by its controlling shareholders. Theory has proposed that when private benefits are high, controlling shareholders are less likely to choose to cross-list in the United States because of constraints on the consumption of private benefits resulting from such listings. Using several proxies for private benefits related to the control and cash flow ownership rights of controlling shareholders, we find support for this hypothesis with a sample of more than 4,000 firms from 31 countries. Academics AND Practitioners Have Proposed many reasons why it is beneficial for foreign firms to cross-list their shares on U.S. Markets.1 One of the most often cited rationales for listing is to lower the cost of capital by overcoming invest- ment barriers that segment capital markets. While this market segmentation view has had some success in explaining why firms benefit from listing, its saliency has diminished as barriers to international investment have sharply decreased for many countries and it cannot explain why relatively few firms list. More recent studies argue that U.S. Cross-listings are beneficial because they limit the ability of controlling shareholders to extract private benefits from Simeon Djankov, Mara Faccio, and Larry Lang for access to their ownership data.

    "title": "Private Benefits of Control: An International",
    "abstract": "We estimate private benefits of control in 39 countries using 393 controlling blocks sales. On average the value of control is 14 percent, but in some countries can be as low as –4 percent, in others as high a +65 percent. As predicted by theory, higher private benefits of control are associated with less developed capital markets, more concentrated ownership, and more privately negotiated privatizations. We also ana- lyze what institutions are most important in curbing private benefits. We find evidence for both legal and extra-legal mechanisms. In a multivariate analysis, however, media pressure and tax enforcement seem to be the dominating factors. THE Benefits OF Control Over corporate resources play a central role in mod- ern thinking about finance and corporate governance. From a modeling device (Grossman and Hart (1980)) the idea of private benefits of control has become a centerpiece of the recent literature in corporate finance, both theoretical and empirical. In fact, the main focus of the literature on investor protection and its role in the development of financial markets (La Porta, Lopez-de-Salines, and Shleifer (2000)) is on the amount of private benefits that controlling sharehold- ers extract from companies they run. In spite of the importance of this concept, there are remarkably few estimates of how big these private benefits are, even fewer attempts to document empir- ically what determines their size, and no direct evidence of their impact on financial de",

    "title": "Private Equity Performance and Liquidity Risk",
    "abstract": "Private equity has traditionally been thought to provide diversiﬁcation beneﬁts. How- ever, these beneﬁts may be lower than anticipated as we ﬁnd that private equity suffers from signiﬁcant exposure to the same liquidity risk factor as public equity and other alternative asset classes. The unconditional liquidity risk premium is about 3% annually and, in a four-factor model, the inclusion of this liquidity risk premium reduces alpha to zero. In addition, we provide evidence that the link between private equity returns and overall market liquidity occurs via a funding liquidity channel. Investing IN Private Equity IS among the preferred choices for long-term in- vestors, such as endowments and pension funds, who seek to diversify their portfolios. Such long-term investors are clearly best suited for holding an illiq- uid asset (i.e., one that cannot be readily traded) such as private equity. The diversiﬁcation beneﬁts of private equity, however, have not been widely docu- mented. In particular, an issue that has not been addressed so far is whether private equity performance, like that of other asset classes, is affected by liquid- ity risk (i.e., co-moves with unexpected changes in overall market liquidity).1 The primary goal of this paper is to quantify liquidity risk in private equity.

    "title": "Private Equity Performance: Returns,",
    "abstract": "This paper investigates the performance and capital inflows of private equity partner- ships. Average fund returns (net of fees) approximately equal the S&P 500 although substantial heterogeneity across funds exists. Returns persist strongly across sub- sequent funds of a partnership. Better performing partnerships are more likely to raise follow-on funds and larger funds. This relationship is concave, so top performing partnerships grow proportionally less than average performers. At the industry level, market entry and fund performance are procyclical; however, established funds are less sensitive to cycles than new entrants. Several of these results differ markedly from those for mutual funds. THE Private Equity Industry , primarily venture capital (VC) and buyout (LBO) investments, has grown tremendously over the last decade. While investors committed less than $10 billion to private equity partnerships in 1991, they committed more than $180 billion at the peak in 2000 (see Jesse Reyes, Private Equity Overview and Update 2002). Despite the increased investment in the private equity asset class and the potential importance of private equity in- vestments for the economy as a whole, we have only a limited understanding of private equity returns, capital flows, and their interrelation. One of the main obstacles has been the lack of available data. Private equity, as the name sug- gests, is largely exempt from public disclosure requirements. In this paper, we make use of a no",

    "title": "Private Equity Performance: What Do We Know?",
    "abstract": "We study the performance of nearly 1,400 U.S. Buyout and venture capital funds using a new data set from Burgiss. We ﬁnd better buyout fund performance than previously documented—performance has consistently exceeded that of public markets. Outper- formance versus the S&P 500 averages 20% to 27% over a fund’s life and more than 3% annually. Venture capital funds outperformed public equities in the 1990s, but underperformed in the 2000s. Our conclusions are robust to various indices and risk controls. Performance in Cambridge Associates and Preqin is qualitatively similar to that in Burgiss, but is lower in Venture Economics. Despite THE Large Increase in investments in private equity (PE) funds and the accompanying academic and practitioner scrutiny, the historical perfor- mance of PE remains uncertain, if not controversial. The uncertainty has been driven by the uneven disclosure of PE returns and questions about prises collect performance data, they do not obtain information for all funds; they often do not disclose, or even collect, fund cash ﬂows; and the source of the data is sometimes obscure, resulting in concerns about sample biases. Furthermore, some data are only periodically made available to academic researchers. In this paper, we use a new research-quality data set of PE fund-level cash ﬂows from Burgiss. We refer to PE as the asset class that includes buyout funds and venture capital (VC) funds. We analyze the two types of funds separately. The data set has a nu",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the role of private equity (PE) in failed-bank resolutions after the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis, using proprietary Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation failed-bank acquisition data. PE investors made substantial investments in under- performing and riskier failed banks, particularly in geographies where local banks were also distressed, ﬁlling the gap created by a weak, undercapitalized banking sec- tor. Using a quasi-random empirical design based on detailed bidding information, we show that PE-acquired banks performed better ex post, with positive real effects for the local economy. Overall, PE investors played a positive role in stabilizing the ﬁnancial system through their involvement in failed-bank resolution. Private Equity (PE) HAS Become an important component of the ﬁnancial system.

    "abstract": "A long-standing controversy is whether leveraged buyouts (LBOs) relieve managers from short-term pressures from public shareholders, or whether LBO funds them- selves sacriﬁce long-term growth to boost short-term performance. We examine one form of long-run activity, namely, investments in innovation as measured by patent- ing activity. Based on 472 LBO transactions, we ﬁnd no evidence that LBOs sacriﬁce long-term investments. LBO ﬁrm patents are more cited (a proxy for economic impor- concentrated in important areas of companies’ innovative portfolios. IN HIS Influential 1989 Paper, “The Eclipse of the Public Corporation,” Michael Jensen predicted that the leveraged buyout (LBO) would emerge as the dom- inant corporate organizational form. With its emphasis on corporate gover- nance, concentrated ownership, monitoring by active owners, strong manage- rial incentives, and efﬁcient capital structure, he argued that the buyout is superior to the public corporation with its dispersed shareholders and weak governance. These features enable LBO managers to add value more effec- tively and make long-run investments without catering to the public market’s demands for steadily growing quarterly proﬁts, which Stein (1988) and others argue can lead ﬁrms to myopically sacriﬁce such expenditures. 1 In this case, it of Economics, Sifr and Cepr.

    "abstract": "We document that public ﬁrms participate more than private ﬁrms as buyers and sellers of assets in merger waves and their participation is affected more by credit spreads and aggregate market valuation. Public ﬁrm acquisitions realize higher gains in productivity, particularly for on-the-wave acquisitions and when the acquirer’s stock is liquid and highly valued. Our results are not driven solely by public ﬁrms’ better access to capital. Using productivity data from early in the ﬁrm’s life, we ﬁnd that better private ﬁrms subsequently select to become public. Initial size and productivity predict asset purchases and sales 10 and more years later. Cal. Mergers and acquisitions tend to cluster in time.1 However, what causes ﬁrms to participate in these waves, and whether acquisitions that occur on the waves lead to the same efﬁciency outcomes as mergers that occur off the waves, remain open questions. The extent to which private ﬁrms participate in merger waves and whether their participation is affected by similar demand and sup- ply factors that affect public ﬁrms also remain unanswered.

    "abstract": "How does competition in ﬁrms’ product markets inﬂuence their behavior in equity markets? Do product market imperfections spread to equity markets? We examine these questions in a noisy rational expectations model in which ﬁrms operate under monopolistic competition while their shares trade in perfectly competitive markets. Firms use their monopoly power to pass on shocks to customers, thereby insulating their proﬁts. This encourages stock trading, expedites the capitalization of private in- formation into stock prices and improves the allocation of capital. Several implications are derived and tested. HOW Does Competition in ﬁrms’ product markets inﬂuence their behavior in equity markets? Do product market imperfections spread to equity markets? These questions are increasingly of interest as product markets are becoming more competitive in many countries thanks to the relaxation of impediments to trade and barriers to entry.1 In this paper, we analyze these questions using a noisy rational expectations model in which ﬁrms operate under monopolistic competition while their shares trade in perfectly competitive markets. The model is guided by recent empirical work showing that stock returns are affected by the intensity of product market competition.

    "abstract": "We examine how product market threats inﬂuence ﬁrm payout policy and cash hold- ings. Using ﬁrms’ product text descriptions, we develop new measures of competitive threats. Our primary measure, product market ﬂuidity, captures changes in rival ﬁrms’ products relative to the ﬁrm’s products. We show that ﬂuidity decreases ﬁrm propensity to make payouts via dividends or repurchases and increases the cash held by ﬁrms, especially for ﬁrms with less access to ﬁnancial markets. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that ﬁrms’ ﬁnancial policies are signiﬁcantly shaped by product market threats and dynamics. WE Examine HOW THE PRODUCTmarket threats faced by a ﬁrm shape its payout policy and cash holdings. Using computational linguistics, we analyze over 42,000 individual ﬁrm business descriptions from ﬁrm 10-Ks to construct new measures of the structure and evolution of the product space occupied by ﬁrms. These measures include product ﬂuidity, a new measure of the competitive threats faced by a ﬁrm in its product market that captures changes in rival ﬁrms’ products relative to the ﬁrm. We use these new text-based measures to test hypotheses about ﬁrms’ ﬁnancial policies including the dividend and repurchase payouts to shareholders and the cash balances retained by ﬁrms.

    "abstract": "We study the effect of a change in property rights on employee behavior in the ﬁnan- cial advice industry. Our identiﬁcation comes from staggered ﬁrm-level entry into the Protocol for Broker Recruiting , which waived nonsolicitation clauses for advisor transitions among member ﬁrms, effectively transferring ownership of client rela- tionships from the ﬁrm to the advisor. After the shock, advisors appear to tend to client relationships more by investing in client-facing industry licenses, shifting to fee-based advising, and reducing customer complaints. Our ﬁndings support prop- erty rights based investment theories of the ﬁrm and document offsetting costs to restricting labor mobility. Financial Advisors , AND THE Firms They work for, play a key role in facilitating household access to ﬁnancial markets. By getting to know their customer and building trust, an advisor can encourage the client to take ap- propriate risk (Gennaioli, Shleifer, and Vishny (2015)) and can identify the best-suited ﬁnancial products for the client (Inderst and Ottaviani (2012)). Though intangible, client relationships can be thought as a productive asset for an advisor.

    "title": "Prospect Theory and Stock Market Anomalies",
    "abstract": "We present a new model of asset prices in which investors evaluate risk according to prospect theory and examine its ability to explain 23 prominent stock market anomalies. The model incorporates all of the elements of prospect theory, accounts for investors’ prior gains and losses, and makes quantitative predictions about an asset’s average return based on empirical estimates of the asset’s return volatility, return skewness, and past capital gain. We ﬁnd that the model can help explain a majority of the 23 anomalies. Prospect Theory , DUE TO Kahneman and Tversky ( 1979) and Tversky and Kahneman (1992), is a highly inﬂuential theory of decision-making under risk. In a parsimonious way, it captures a wide range of experimental evidence on attitudes to risk. As such, it has the potential to shed light on asset prices and investor behavior. However, despite years of effort, we still do not understand its implications for some basic aspects of asset prices, such as the cross-section of average returns. Under mean-variance preferences, average returns are de- scribed by the Capital Asset Pricing Model (capm). But what determines aver- age returns when investors instead evaluate risk according to prospect theory? What does prospect theory predict about the relative average returns of small- cap stocks and large-cap stocks, or of value stocks and growth stocks? Answers to these basic questions are still not available. In this paper, we answer these questions. We build a new model o",

If the quality of the advisor’s information is low, there is overreliance on its recommendations and insufﬁcient private information production. In contrast, if the advisor’s information is precise, it may be underused because the advisor rations its recommendations to maximize proﬁts.

    "title": "Pseudo Market Timing and the Long-Run",
    "abstract": "Numerous studies document long-run underperformance by firms following equity offerings. This paper shows that underperformance is very likely to be observed ex-post in an efficient market. The premise is that more firms issue equity at higher stock prices even though they cannot predict future returns. Ex-post, issuers seem to time the market because offerings cluster at market peaks. Simulations based on 1973 through 1997 data reveal that when ex-ante expected abnormal returns are zero, median ex-post underperformance for equity issuers will be significantly negative in event-time. Using calendar-time returns solves the problem. IN A Seminal Study, Ritter (1991) shows that initial public offerings (IPOs) under- perform relative to indices and matching stocks in the three to five years after going public. Similar underperformance following seasoned offerings is reported by Loughran and Ritter (1995), Spiess and Affleck-Graves (1995), Lee (1997), and others. At the aggregate level, Baker and Wurgler (2000) find that stock market returns are lower following years when equity accounts for a large proportion of total financing. The poor performance of IPOs has also been documented for other markets and other times. Keloharju (1993), Levis (1993), Lee, Taylor, and Walter (1996), Arosio, Giudici, and Paleari (2001), and others report poor long-run performance in a number of other countries. Gompers and Lerner (2003) show that IPOs issued between 1935 and 1972 performed poorly in t",

    "title": "Public Information and Coordination: Evidence",
    "abstract": "This paper provides evidence that lenders to a ﬁrm close to distress have incentives to coordinate: lower ﬁnancing by one lender reduces ﬁrm creditworthiness and causes other lenders to reduce ﬁnancing. To isolate the coordination channel from lenders’ joint reaction to new information, we exploit a natural experiment that forced lenders to share negative private assessments about their borrowers. We show that lenders, while learning nothing new about the ﬁrm, reduce credit in anticipation of other lenders’ reaction to the negative news about the ﬁrm. The results show that pub- lic information exacerbates lender coordination and increases the incidence of ﬁrm ﬁnancial distress. Creditors TO A Firm Have an incentive to coordinate when the ﬁrm is close to ﬁnancial distress. A creditor has less incentive to provide additional ﬁnancing if it believes that other creditors to the ﬁrm are about to liquidate their claims and potentially disrupt the ﬁrm’s operations. These coordination incentives may have ﬁrst-order effects on equilibrium credit and default. For example, they can lead to creditor runs whereby each creditor withdraws ﬁnancing due to the expectation other creditors will do the same, although collectively creditors would be better off by lending. Modern bankruptcy code is designed to alleviate this type of creditor coordination problem in distress (Jackson (1986)). Despite the importance of lender coordination incentives for theory and pol- icy, to date there is no direc",

    "abstract": "The price formation process of Jasdaq IPOs is more transparent than in the United States. The transparency facilitates analysis of important issues in the IPO literature—why offer prices only partially adjust to public information and adjust more fully to negative information, and why adjustments are related to initial re- turns. The evidence indicates that early price information conveys the underwriter’s commitment to compensate investors for acquiring and/or disclosing information. Of- fer prices reflect pre-IPO market values of public companies and implicit agreements between underwriters and issuers that originate well before the offering. Underad- justment of offer prices is substantially reversed in the aftermarket. THE Initial Public Offering (IPO) underpricing puzzle has attracted the atten- tion of scholars for more than three decades. Many hypotheses have been of- fered to explain why, on average, new issues are underpriced relative to the first aftermarket price; why, during the price formation process, offer prices do not adjust fully to new information about demand; and why, perhaps more surprisingly, offer prices do not even adjust fully to public information. Despite numerous empirical studies, the U.S. IPO evidence has not convincingly sup- ported or refuted any of the hypotheses. The Japanese IPO market, however, offers an opportunity for testing that can more effectively discriminate among them. The price formation process in Japan is more transparent than",

    "title": "Public Pension Promises: How Big Are They",
    "abstract": "We calculate the present value of state employee pension liabilities using discount rates that reﬂect the risk of the payments from a taxpayer perspective. If beneﬁts have the same default and recovery characteristics as state general obligation debt, the national total of promised liabilities based on current salary and service is $3.20 trillion. If pensions have higher priority than state debt, the value of liabilities is much larger. Using zero-coupon Treasury yields, which are default-free but contain other priced risks, promised liabilities are $4.43 trillion. Liabilities are even larger under broader concepts that account for salary growth and future service. Government Accounting Rules currently obscure the magnitude of public pension liabilities in the United States. In particular, Government Account- ing Standards Board (gasb) ruling 25 and Actuarial Standards of Practice (asop) item 27 stipulate that public pension liabilities are to be discounted at the expected rate of return on pension assets. This procedure creates a major potential bias in the measurement of public pension liabilities. Discounting liabilities at an expected rate of return on the assets in the plan runs en- tirely counter to the logic of ﬁnancial economics: ﬁnancial streams of payment should be discounted at a rate that reﬂects their risk (Modigliani and Miller (1958)), and in particular their covariance with priced risks (Treynor (1961), Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1965)).

    "abstract": "We analyze how boards’ reputational concerns inﬂuence executive compensation and the use of hidden pay. Independent boards reduce disclosed pay to signal their in- dependence, but are more likely than manager-friendly boards to use hidden pay or to distort incentive contracts. Stronger reputational pressures lead to lower dis- closed pay, weaker managerial incentives, and higher hidden pay, whereas greater transparency of executive compensation has the opposite effects. Although reputa- tional concerns can induce boards to choose compensation contracts more favorable to shareholders, we show that there is a threshold beyond which stronger reputational concerns harm shareholders. Similarly, excessive pay transparency can harm share- holders. Boards OF Directors SET CEO pay. Understanding how directors’ incen- tives affect compensation contracts is therefore essential for understanding executive pay. In this paper, we model CEO pay explicitly as a board deci- sion determined by the extent of director independence and by directors’ rep- utational concerns. We show that a key consequence of directors’ reputational concerns is the use of camouﬂaged or hidden forms of pay, which are otherwise difﬁcult to rationalize in optimal contracting models. 1 de Madrid.

    "abstract": "We propose a novel way to estimate a portfolio’s abnormal price , the percentage gap between price and the present value of dividends computed with a chosen asset pric- ing model. Our method, based on a novel identity, resembles the time-series estimator of abnormal returns, avoids the issues in alternative approaches, and clariﬁes the role of risk and mispricing in long-horizon returns. We apply our techniques to study the cross-section of price levels relative to the capital asset pricing model (capm) and ﬁnd that a single characteristic, adjusted value , provides a parsimonious model of CAPM-implied abnormal price. HOW Well Does AN Asset pricing model explain stocks’ observed price lev- els? And which stock characteristics signal model-speciﬁc abnormal price ,t h e deviation of price from the present value of future dividends? 1 These are central questions in ﬁnance, as stock price levels can drive the ﬁnancing and investment decisions of ﬁrms as well as the portfolio decisions of long- term buy-and-hold investors.

    "abstract": "This paper quantiﬁes the aggregate effects of ﬁnancing constraints. We start from a standard dynamic investment model with collateral constraints. In contrast to the ex- isting quantitative literature, our estimation does not target the mean leverage ratio to identify the scope of ﬁnancing frictions. Instead, we use a reduced-form coefﬁcient from the recent corporate ﬁnance literature that connects exogenous debt capacity shocks to corporate investment. Relative to a frictionless benchmark, collateral con- straints induce losses of 7.1% for output and 1.4% for total factor productivity (TFP) (misallocation). We show these estimated losses tend to be more robust to misspeciﬁ- cation than estimates obtained by targeting leverage. AN Accumulating Body OF Evidence shows the causal effect of ﬁnancing frictions onﬁrm-level outcomes.

    "abstract": "Using data from all of the leading international investment banks on 220 initial public offerings (IPOs) raising $160 billion between January 2010 and May 2015, we test the determinants of IPO allocations. We compare investors’ IPO allocations with proxies for their information production during bookbuilding and the broking (and other) revenues they generate for bookrunners. We ﬁnd evidence consistent with information revelation theories. We also ﬁnd strong support for the existence of a quid pro quo whereby broking revenues are a signiﬁcant determinant of investors’ IPO allocations and proﬁts. The quid pro quo remains when we control for unobserved investor characteristics and investor-bank relationships. Initial Public Offerings (ipos) Play an important role in the ﬁnancial sys- tem, enabling companies to raise equity ﬁnance and providing investors with a tradeable asset. Doubts remain, however, about how well the IPO market operates for issuing companies. The IPO boom in the United States during the dot-com period—in particular, 1999 to 2000—witnessed several scandals, which involved laddering, spinning, 1 analysts’ conﬂicts of interest, as well as heavily underpriced shares being allocated in return for excessive trading com- missions (Liu and Ritter ( 2010)).

    "abstract": "An entrepreneur makes offers to multiple investors to fund a project that requires a minimum investment. Concerned about other investors’ decisions, each investor strategically communicates information about the project to others. When investors have conﬂicts of interest, those with contractually stronger incentives to invest at- tempt to persuade others to invest. Depending on the project’s ex ante quality, the entrepreneur may promise investors different returns to create conﬂicts of interest and induce persuasion, or may promise investors an identical return to align their in- terests and induce truthful communication. The paper illustrates a new motivation for syndication and hierarchy within syndicates. AN Investor Syndicate IS A temporary alliance of investors who join to- gether to manage an investment. In practice, projects and ﬁrms are commonly ﬁnanced in this way. Two well-known examples are syndicated loans and venture capital (VC) syndicates.

    "abstract": "We propose using the price range in the estimation of stochastic volatility models. We show theoretically, numerically, and empirically that range-based volatility prox- ies are not only highly efficient, but also approximately Gaussian and robust to mi- crostructure noise. Hence range-based Gaussian quasi-maximum likelihood estimation produces highly efficient estimates of stochastic volatility models and extractions of latent volatility. We use our method to examine the dynamics of daily exchange rate volatility and find the evidence points strongly toward two-factor models with one highly persistent factor and one quickly mean-reverting factor. Volatility IS A Central Concept in finance, whether in asset pricing, portfolio choice, or risk management. Not long ago, theoretical models routinely as- sumed constant volatility (e.g., Merton (1969), Black and Scholes (1973)). Today, however, we widely acknowledge that volatility is both time varying and predictable (e.g., Andersen and Bollerslev (1997)), and stochastic vola- tility models are commonplace. Discrete- and continuous-time stochastic vol- atility models are extensively used in theoretical finance, empirical finance, and financial econometrics, both in academe and industry (e.g., Hull and White (1987), Heston (1993), Bates (1996), Ghysels, Harvey, and Renault (1996), Jarrow (1998), Duffie, Pan, and Singleton (2000)).

    "abstract": "We investigate simultaneously the impact of promotion-based tournament incentives for VPs and equity-based (alignment) incentives for VPs and the chief executive officer (CEO) on firm performance. We find that tournament incentives, as measured by the pay differential between the CEO and VPs, relate positively to firm performance. The relation is more positive when the CEO nears retirement and less positive when the firm has a new CEO, and weakens further when the new CEO is an outsider. Our analysis is robust to corrections for endogeneity of all our incentive measures and to several alternative measures of tournament incentives and firm performance.

    "abstract": "Past studies document that incentive conﬂicts may lead issuer-paid credit rating agencies to provide optimistically biased ratings. In this paper, we present evidence that investors question the quality of issuer-paid ratings and raise corporate bond yields where the issuer-paid rating is more positive than benchmark investor-paid ratings. We also ﬁnd that some ﬁrms with favorable issuer-paid ratings substitute public bonds with borrowings from informed intermediaries to mitigate the “lemons discount” associated with poor quality ratings. Overall, our results suggest that the quality of issuer-paid ratings has signiﬁcant effects on borrowing costs and the choice of debt. Credit Rating Agencies ARE Financial intermediaries that facilitate ‘‘arm’s length” debt ﬁnancing by reducing information asymmetries between issuers and investors through forward-looking opinions about the credit quality of issuers and their speciﬁc debt obligations. By aggregating information about credit quality from public and private sources into a single measure, rating agencies reduce individual investors’ need to conduct detailed due diligence and thereby broaden issuers’ investor base beyond sophisticated investors willing and able to engage in complex credit analyses (see, for example, Faulkender and Petersen (2006) and Suﬁ (2009)). Past studies suggest, however, that reliance on compensation paid by the issuers that they rate may lead rating agencies to provide over optimistic rat- ings.1 In this p",

    "abstract": "The mean, covariability, and predictability of the return of different classes of financial assets challenge the rational economic model for an explanation. The unconditional mean aggregate equity premium is almost seven percent per year and remains high after adjusting downwards the sample mean premium by intro- ducing prior beliefs about the stationarity of the price-dividend ratio and the (non)- forecastability of the long-term dividend growth and price-dividend ratio. Recognition that idiosyncratic income shocks are uninsurable and concentrated in recessions contributes toward an explanation. Also borrowing constraints over the investors' life cycle that shift the stock market risk to the saving middle-aged consumers contribute toward an explanation. A central theme in finance and economics is the pursuit of a unified theory of the rate of return across different classes of financial assets. In particular, we are interested in the mean, covariability, and predictability of the return of financial assets. At the macro level, we study the short-term risk-free rate, the term premium of long-term bonds over the risk-free rate, and the aggregate equity premium of the stock market over the risk-free rate.

    "title": "Rational IPO Waves",
    "abstract": "We argue that the number of firms going public changes over time in response to time variation in market conditions. We develop a model of optimal initial public offering (IPO) timing in which IPO waves are caused by declines in expected market return, increases in expected aggregate profitability, or increases in prior uncertainty about the average future profitability of IPOs. We test and find support for the model’s empirical predictions. For example, we find that IPO waves tend to be preceded by high market returns and followed by low market returns. THE Number OF Initial Public Offerings (IPOS)c hanges dramatically over time, as shown in Figure 1. For example, 845 firms went public in the United States in 1996, but there were only 87 IPOs in 2002. Although the fluctuation in IPO volume is well known (e.g., Ibbotson and Jaffe (1975)), its underlying causes are not well understood. Many researchers attribute time variation in IPO volume to market inefficiency, arguing that IPO volume is high when shares are “overvalued.” 1 Such an argument assumes that the periodic market mispricing can somehow be detected by the owners of the firms going public, but not by the investors providing IPO funds. In contrast, we present a model in which fluctuation in IPO volume arises in the absence of any mispricing, and in which IPO volume is more closely related to recent changes in stock prices than to the level of stock prices.

We show that this rational inattention to important news may make investors over- or underinvest. In addition, the optimal trading strategy is “myopic” with respect to future news frequency and accuracy. We find that the optimal news frequency is nonmonotonic in news accuracy and investment horizon. Furthermore, when both news frequency and news accuracy are endogenized, an investor with a higher risk aversion or a longer investment horizon chooses less frequent but more accurate periodic news updates. Standard Portfolio Selection Theories assume that investors can costlessly ob- tain and process all the relevant information that affects investment perfor- mance. However, this assumption does not hold for most investors, including the most sophisticated ones. Both information production (data collection and noise reduction) and information processing can be very costly in terms of required time, effort, and expenses. These costs induce limited attention. 1 Indeed, Hong, Torous, and Valkanov (2002), among others, provide evidence of investor inat- tention to important economic news. Motivated by this observation, Bacchetta and van Wincoop (2005) build an overlapping generations model to explain the forward discount and predictability puzzle with rational inattention. 2 Peng and Xiong (2006) show that inattention can lead to “category",

    "title": "Rational Momentum Effects",
    "abstract": "Momentum effects in stock returns need not imply investor irrationality, hetero- geneous information, or market frictions. A simple, single-firm model with a stan- dard pricing kernel can produce such effects when expected dividend growth rates vary over time. An enhanced model, under which persistent growth rate shocks occur episodically, can match many of the features documented by the empirical anomalies in general. There Would Appear TO BE FEW more flagrant affronts to the idea of rational, efficient markets than the existence of large excess returns to simple mo- mentum strategies in the stock market. So naturally do these profits sug- gest systematic underreaction by the market, and so unpromising seems the attempt to associate the rewards with risk factors, that asset pricing theo- rists have mostly seen the task as simply one of deciding which sort of in- vestor irrationality is at work.' This article suggests that the case for rational momentum effects is not hopeless, however. In fact, a simple, standard model of firm cash-flows dis- counted by an ordinary pricing kernel can deliver a strong positive correla- tion between past realized returns and current expected returns. The framework is simplified and ignores many features crucial for valuing real firms. The point is just to call attention to a direct, plausible, and rational mechanism that may contribute to this puzzling phenomenon. The key to the model is stochastic expected growth rates.

    "abstract": "This paper studies reaching for yield—investors’ propensity to buy riskier assets to achieve higher yields—in the corporate bond market. We show that insurance com- panies reach for yield in choosing their investments. Consistent with lower rated bonds bearing higher capital requirements, insurance ﬁrms prefer to hold higher rated bonds. However, conditional on credit ratings, insurance portfolios are system- atically biased toward higher yield, higher CDS bonds. This behavior is related to the business cycle being most pronounced during economic expansions. It is also charac- teristic of ﬁrms with poor corporate governance and for which the regulatory capital requirement is more binding. A KEY Principle OF Finance is that the evaluation of returns is only meaningful on a risk-adjusted basis. However, risk is often hard to measure. This creates an important limitation in the delegation of investment decisions. Financial in- termediaries and investment managers that are evaluated based on imperfect risk metrics face an incentive to buy assets that comply with a set benchmark but are risky on other dimensions. In other words, imperfect benchmarks may create incentives to “reach for yield” in the context of ﬁxed income investing or to reach for apparent “ α” more generally. This could lead to excess risk-taking in ﬁnancial institutions, a persistent distortion in investment, and, potentially, ampliﬁcation of overall risk in the economy. Indeed, reaching for yield is be- lieved t",

    "title": "Real Anomalies",
    "abstract": "We examine the importance of cross-sectional asset pricing anomalies (alphas) for the real economy. To this end, we develop a novel quantitative model of the cross-section of ﬁrms that features lumpy investment and informational inefﬁciencies, while yielding distributions in closed form. Our ﬁndings indicate that anomalies can cause material real inefﬁciencies, which raises the possibility that agents who help eliminate them add signiﬁcant value to the economy. The model shows that the magnitude of alphas alone is a poor indicator of real outcomes, and highlights the importance of the alpha persistence, the amount of mispriced capital, and the Tobin’sq of ﬁrms affected. Over THE Past FEW Decades, a vast literature has developed that attempts to document and explain the behavior of asset prices both in the cross-section and in the time series. The seminal paper on excess volatility—Shiller (1981)—has spurred a literature that attempts to explain why stock markets are so volatile and whether such volatility is excessive. The literature has further uncovered a large number of “anomalies” in the cross-section of asset prices that suggest the presence of mispricings.1 These empirical ﬁndings raise an important question: if the documented pat- terns in ﬁnancial market returns do indeed reﬂect informational inefﬁciencies in the economy, how large are the resulting real efﬁciency losses?

    "abstract": "We use a stochastic frontier model to obtain a stock-level estimate of the difference be- tween a ﬁrm’s installed production capacity and its optimal capacity. We show that this “capacity overhang” estimate relates signiﬁcantly negatively to the cross sec- tion of stock returns, even when controlling for popular pricing factors. The negative relation persists among small and large stocks, stocks with more or less reversible investments, and in good and bad economic states. Capacity overhang helps explain momentum and proﬁtability anomalies, but not value and investment anomalies. Our evidence supports real options models of the ﬁrm featuring valuable divestment options. Recent Studies USE Real Options Theory to establish links between a ﬁrm’s capacity-related decisions, systematic risk, and characteristics. Focusing on a ﬁrm that owns both installed production capacity and costly-to-reverse growth options, a common result in these studies is that the ﬁrm’s ex- pected return depends on the difference between its installed capacity and the level of capacity that maximizes ﬁrm value net of capacity installation costs Associate Editors, and the Managing Editor (Kenneth Singleton) for helpful and constructive sug- gestions.

    "abstract": "We study how competition in the product market affects the link between firms’ real in- vestment decisions and their asset return dynamics. In our model, assets in place and growth options have different sensitivities to market wide uncertainty. The strategic behavior of market participants influences the relative importance of these compo- nents of firm value. We show that the relationship between the degree of competition and assets’ expected rates of return varies with product market demand. When de- mand is low, firms in more competitive industries earn higher returns, whereas when demand is high firms in more concentrated industries earn higher returns. Firms’investment AND Operating Decisions CAN explain conditional dynamics in expected asset returns. For example, consider a firm that has an opportunity to expand its current production capacity. Since this growth option has leverage arising from its investment costs, its systematic risk may be higher than that of the assets already in place. Consequently, the firm’s exposure to systematic risk increases as the investment in additional capacity is more attractive because the growth opportunity accounts for a larger fraction of firm value. Most of the recent theoretical work that links firms’ optimal investment be- havior to their expected returns does not take into account the effect of compe- tition in the product market when analyzing the risk dynamics of the firms in a given industry.

    "title": "Real Options, Volatility, and Stock Returns",
    "abstract": "We provide evidence that the positive relation between ﬁrm-level stock returns and ﬁrm-level return volatility is due to ﬁrms’ real options. Consistent with real option theory, we ﬁnd that the positive volatility-return relation is much stronger for ﬁrms with more real options and that the sensitivity of ﬁrm value to changes in volatility declines signiﬁcantly after ﬁrms exercise their real options. We reconcile the evidence at the aggregate and ﬁrm levels by showing that the negative relation at the aggregate level may be due to aggregate market conditions that simultaneously affect both market returns and return volatility. IT IS Well Established in the asset pricing literature that aggregate market returns are negatively correlated with aggregate market volatility (e.g.,French, Schwert, and Stambaugh (1987), Campbell and Hentschel (1992), andDuffee (1995)). One possible explanation for this negative relation is the “leverage effect” hypothesis (e.g.,Black (1976) and Christie (1982)), which states that when stock prices fall, ﬁrms become more levered, raising the volatility of stock returns. Another explanation, due toFrench, Schwert, and Stambaugh (1987), holds that, because an increase in systematic volatility raises risk premia and expected future stock returns, an unexpected change in (systematic) volatility is likely to reduce ﬁrm values, leading to a negative association between volatility and contemporaneous returns.

    "abstract": "We examine how product market competition affects ﬁrm cash ﬂows and stock returns in industry booms and busts. Our results show how real and ﬁnancial factors interact in industry business cycles. In competitive industries, we ﬁnd that high industry-level stock market valuation, investment, and ﬁnancing are followed by sharply lower oper- ating cash ﬂows and abnormal stock returns. Analyst estimates are positively biased and returns comove more. In concentrated industries these relations are weak and generally insigniﬁcant. Our results are consistent with participants in competitive industries not fully internalizing the negative externality of industry competition on cash ﬂows and stock returns. Throughout History, Industries have gone through cycles in which ﬁrms have very high valuations and investment followed by lower subsequent valuations and investment. Periods associated with high valuations are commonly writ- ten about as the start of a “new era” in which productivity increases and new products justify very high stock prices and prompt massive investment. 1 This phenomenon is present in many industries over time, and recent examples include the recent real estate boom and late 1990s internet and telecommuni- cations boom. 2 In this paper, we ask whether product market characteristics search (nber), respectively.

    "abstract": "Over-the-counter (OTC) trading thrives despite competition from exchanges. We let OTC dealers cream skim from exchanges in an otherwise standard Glosten and Mil- grom framework. Restricting the dealer’s ability to cream skim induces “cheap sub- stitution”: some traders exit while others with larger gains from trade enter. Cheap substitution implies trading costs, trade volumes, and market shares are poor policy indicators. In a benchmark case, restricting the dealer raises welfare only if trad- ing cost increases, volume falls, and OTC market share is high. By contrast, the restriction improves welfare when adverse selection risk is low. A simple procedure implements the optimal Pigouvian tax. Over -THE -counter (OTC) Markets ARE Opaque and difﬁcult to access, 1 yet they host the vast majority of ﬁnancial trades, as most assets are seldom traded on centralized exchanges.

Analyst forecast dis- persion increases, and increases in other measures of disagreement and difference of opinion suggest greater difficulty in forming forecasts beyond the current quarter. Corporations increase the quantity of voluntary disclo- sures, but only for current quarter earnings. Thus, Reg FD seems to increase the quantity of information available to the public while imposing greater de- mands on investment professionals.

A flow of information that is accurate, efficient, and fair contributes to a well-function- ing capital market that satisfies the needs of all users and enhances economic growth and stability.

In the model, reducing the number of charlatans through regulation lowers consumer surplus because of the resulting reduction in competition among producers. Producers can beneﬁt from this reduction, potentially explaining the reg- ulation we observe. The effect on total surplus depends on the type of regulation. We derive the factors that drive the cross-sectional variation in charlatans (regulation) across professions. “We write today to ask what speciﬁc steps Finra will take to address the pervasive misconduct among its ﬁnancial advisers and to protect families looking to invest their hard-earned savings.” U.S. Senators E.

Using a sample of 7,297 domestic and 916 majority cross-border deals announced between 1995 and 2012, we ﬁnd evidence of a form of “regulatory arbitrage” whereby acquisition ﬂows involve acquirers from countries with stronger regulations than their targets. Target and aggregate abnormal returns around deal announcements are positive and larger when acquirers come from more restrictive bank regulatory environments. We inter- pret this evidence as more consistent with a benign form of regulatory arbitrage than a potentially destructive one. THE Recent Global FINANCIALcrisis, caused in part by systemic failures in bank regulation (Levine (2012)), has sparked, among other things, a strong push for both stricter capital requirements and greater international coordination in regulation.

We ﬁnd strong evidence that banks have transferred funds to markets with fewer regulations. This form of regulatory arbitrage suggests there may be a destructive “race to the bottom” in global regulations, which restricts domestic reg- ulators’ ability to limit bank risk-taking. However, we also ﬁnd that the links be- tween regulation differences and bank ﬂows are signiﬁcantly stronger if the recipient country is a developed country with strong property rights and creditor rights. This suggests that, while differences in regulations have important inﬂuences, without a strong institutional environment, lax regulations are not enough to encourage mas- sive capital ﬂows.

    "abstract": "Regulatory fragmentation occurs when multiple federal agencies oversee a single is- sue. Using the full text of the Federal Register, the government’s ofﬁcial daily publi- cation, we provide the ﬁrst systematic evidence on the extent and costs of regulatory fragmentation. Fragmentation increases the ﬁrm’s costs while lowering its productiv- ity, proﬁtability, and growth. Moreover, it deters entry into an industry and increases the propensity of small ﬁrms to exit. These effects arise from redundancy and, more prominently, from inconsistencies between government agencies. Our results uncover a new source of regulatory burden, and we show that agency costs among regulators contribute to this burden. THE Federal Government IS THE most inﬂuential actor in the U.S. Econ- omy, and many studies document the signiﬁcant burden imposed by the government on companies. The literature tends to focus on one aspect of this burden: the cost of complying with speciﬁc regulations. In this paper, we highlight a different notion of burden, namely, regulatory fragmentation: the regulation of a single topic by multiple federal agencies. As of September 2021, the Government Accountability Ofﬁce (GAO) has issued 11 annual reports on the fragmentation, overlap, and duplication of federal activities (GAO ( 2021)).

Investors who experience particularly rewarding out- comes from 401(k) saving—a high average and/or low variance return—increase their 401(k) savings rate more than investors who have less rewarding experiences. This finding is not driven by aggregate time-series shocks, income effects, rational learning about investing skill, investor fixed effects, or time-varying investor-level heterogene- ity that is correlated with portfolio allocations to stock, bond, and cash asset classes.

I estimate an In- tertemporal Capital Asset Pricing Model (icapm) to show that the trade-off between market and reinvestment risk explains this pattern. Intuitively, while long-term divi- dend claims are highly exposed to market risk, they are good hedges for reinvestment risk because dividend prices rise as expected returns decline, and longer-term claims are more sensitive to discount rates. In the estimated Icapm, reinvestment risk dom- inates at long maturities, inducing relatively low risk premia on long-term dividend claims. The model is also consistent with the equity term structure cyclicality and the upward-sloping bond term structure. Calculating Appropriate Risk Premia TO Discount future cash ﬂows is at the heart of investment decisions. But how do risk premia vary with cash Chapel Hill.

    "title": "Relationship Trading in Over-the-Counter",
    "abstract": "We examine the network of trading relationships between insurers and dealers in the over-the-counter (OTC) corporate bond market. Regulatory data show that one-third of insurers use a single dealer, whereas other insurers have large dealer networks. Execution prices are nonmonotone in network size, initially declining with more deal- ers but increasing once networks exceed 20 dealers. A model of decentralized trade in which insurers trade off the beneﬁts of repeat business and faster execution quanti- tatively ﬁts the distribution of insurers’ network size and explains the price–network size relationship. Counterfactual analysis shows that regulations to unbundle trade and nontrade services can decrease welfare. Insurance Companies ARE Vital FOR risk sharing: In exchange for premium payments, they compensate for loss, damage, injury, treatment, or hardship. To provide this coverage, insurance companies invest in a variety of ﬁnancial assets.

Together these incentive mechanisms provide directors with wealth increases of approximately 11 cents per $1,000 rise in firm value. Although smaller than the per- formance sensitivities of CEOs, outside directors’ incentives imply a change in wealth of about $285,000 for a 1 standard deviation (SD) change in typical firm performance. Cross-sectional patterns of director equity awards conform to agency and financial theories. What Causes Outside Directors to monitor managers, rather than collude with them? Fama and Jensen (1983) posit the existence of a market for outside directors’ services, conjecturing that “Our hypothesis is that outside directors have incentives to develop reputations as experts in decision control...They use their directorships to signal to internal and external markets for decision agents that they are experts... The signals are credible when the direct payments to outside directors are small, but there is substantial devaluation of human capital when internal decision control breaks down... ” (p. 315). To date, most studies of the market for outside directors have focused on directors’ accumulation of seats on additional boards, finding some evidence that fewer offers for new directorships are made to board members of firms ined the most direct incentives—compensation and r",

    "title": "Rent Extraction with Securities Plus Cash",
    "abstract": "In our target-initiated theory of takeovers, a target approaches potential acquirers that privately know their standalone values and merger synergies, where higher synergy acquirers tend to have larger standalone values. Despite their information disadvantage, targets can extract all surplus when synergies and standalone val- ues are concavely related by offering payment choices that are combinations of cash and equity. Targets exploit the reluctance of high-valuation acquirers to cede equity claims, inducing them to bid more cash. When synergies and standalone values are not concavely related, sellers can gain by combining cash with securities that are more information sensitive than equities. Premise that they are initiated by bidders. However, in recent work, Eckbo, Norli, and Thorburn ( 2020) establish that “about one half of takeover bids for public targets are initiated by the target, organizing an auction-like process to solicit potential bids” (see p. 247, Eckbo, Malenko, and Thorburn ( 2020)). Our paper derives the optimal design of such auctions, including the speciﬁca- tions of the cash-equity composition of bids. We show that this optimal design reconciles a set of empirical regularities that are elusive to explain within a single uniﬁed framework: (i) Multiple public bidders emerge in few control contests (under 10%) for publicly traded targets; (ii) despite this seeming lack of competition, on average almost all of the combined takeover gains accrue to target sh",

    "abstract": "We show that past inﬂation experiences strongly predict homeownership within and across countries. First, we collect novel survey data, which reveal inﬂation protection to be a key motivation for homeownership, especially after high inﬂation experiences. Second, using household data from 22 European countries, we ﬁnd that higher expo- sure to historical inﬂation predicts higher homeownership rates. We estimate similar associations among immigrants to the United States who experienced different past inﬂation in their home countries but face the same U.S. Housing market. Consistent with the experience effects model, the relationship is strongest in countries with pre- dominantly ﬁxed-rate mortgages. Homeownership Rates Vary Widely , Both across and within countries. In Europe, less than half of households own their home in Germany and Austria, but 85% or more own in Lithuania, Slovakia, and Croatia. Only 57% own their home in France, but 82% do in neighboring Spain. Within country , 48% of 30- year-olds, but 79% of 60-year-olds own their home in Italy . In the Netherlands, in contrast, homeownership is nearly identical for 30- and 60-year-olds. What explains these differences? Why do households with similar demo- graphics and in similar ﬁnancial situations make systematically different tenure decisions?

    "title": "Rents and Intangible Capital: A Q+ Framework",
    "abstract": "In recent years, U.S. Investment has been lackluster, despite rising valuations. Key explanations include growing rents and growing intangibles. We propose and esti- mate a framework to quantify their roles. The gap between valuations—reﬂected in average Q—and investment—reﬂected in marginal q—can be decomposed into three terms: the value of installed intangibles; rents generated by physical capital; and an interaction term, measuring rents generated by intangibles. The intangible related terms contribute signiﬁcantly to the gap, particularly in fast-growing sec- tors. Our ﬁndings suggest care in a pure-rents interpretation, given the rising role of intangibles. Run facts about the U.S. Economy: returns to business capital, and corporate proﬁts more generally, have been either stable or growing (Gomme, Ravikumar, and Rupert ( 2011)); yet investment has been lackluster, in particular relative to corporate valuations (Gutiérrez and Philippon ( 2017), Alexander and Eberly (2018). Ceteris paribus, investment theory would predict a rise in investment in response to higher returns to capital and corporate valuations. In neoclassical models, the divergence between returns and investment can be cast as a rising gap between the average value of business capital, or Tobin’s average Q , and its marginal value, or Tobin’s marginal q . We directly observe rising average Q in the data, via market values, while marginal q is a shadow value measured implicitly by lackluster investment. A gap",

    "title": "Repo Runs: Evidence from the Tri-Party Repo",
    "abstract": "The repo market has been viewed as a potential source of ﬁnancial instability since the 2007 to 2009 ﬁnancial crisis, based in part on ﬁndings that margins increased sharply in a segment of this market. This paper provides evidence suggesting that there was no system-wide run on repo. Using conﬁdential data on tri-party repo, a major segment of this market, we show that, the level of margins and the amount of funding were surprisingly stable for most borrowers during the crisis. However, we also document a sharp decline in the tri-party repo funding of Lehman in September 2008. Since the ﬁnancial crisis of 2007 to 2009. In particular, Gorton and Metrick (2012) document a large increase in margins in one segment of the repo market, which they interpret as a run. Because of this ﬁnding and the repo market’s role as a major source of short-term funding, repo markets have been viewed as an important source of ﬁnancial fragility. In this paper, we show that, based on evidence from the tri-party repo market, which is a major segment of the repo market, there was no system-wide run on repo. A repo is the sale of an asset, coupled with the promise to repurchase the asset at a speciﬁc price at a speciﬁc future date. Repos are similar to collat- eralized loans, aside from their special treatment in case of bankruptcy (see Appendix Iii.c in Copeland, Martin, and Walker (2010) for more detail).

    "title": "Repo over the Financial Crisis",
    "abstract": "This paper uses new data to provide a comprehensive view of repo activity during the 2007 global ﬁnancial crisis. We show that activity declined much more in the bilateral segment of the market than in the tri-party segment. Surprisingly, a large share of the decline in activity is driven by repos backed by Treasury securities. Further, a dis- proportionate share of the decline in repo activity is connected to securities dealer’s market-making activity. In particular, the evidence suggests that at least part of the decline is not driven by clients pulling away from securities dealers because of coun- terparty credit concerns. THE 2007 TO 2009 global ﬁnancial crisis (GFC) highlighted important vulner- abilities of the U.S. Repo market. The volume of repo activity declined dramat- ically in the fall of 2008, around the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and several studies have shed some light on these events. These studies present a some- what contrasting account of what happened, in part because the authors focus on different segments of the market, due to data limitations. For example, Gor- ton and Metrick (2012) highlight a sharp increase in haircuts in the bilateral segment of the repo market and take that as evidence of a generalized “run on repo.” Building on this result, Gorton, Metrick, and Ross (2020) document a dramatic decline in net repo funding to banks and broker dealers. By contrast, Copeland, Martin, and Walker (2014) and Krishnamurthy, Nagel, and Orlov (2014) show t",

    "abstract": "Theory suggests that reputations allow nonanonymous markets to attenuate adverse selection in trading. We identify instances in which New York Stock Exchange (nyse) stocks experience trading floor relocations. Although specialists follow the stocks to their new locations, most brokers do not. We find a discernable increase in liquidity costs around a stock’s relocation that is larger for stocks with higher adverse selection and greater broker turnover. We also find that floor brokers relocating with the stock obtain lower trading costs than brokers not moving and brokers beginning trading post-move. Our results suggest that reputation plays an important role in the NYSE’s liquidity provision process. Klein (1997) Documents That Reputation HAS Played A Role in facilitating trade since at least the Middle Ages by reducing information asymmetries between buyers and sellers. Diamond (1991), Boot, Greenbaum, and Thakor (1993), and Wilner (2000) model reputation’s role in various financial market settings. De- spite its perceived importance, there is little direct empirical evidence as to the economic value of relationships in financial markets. DeJong, Forsythe, and Lundholm (1985) and others find that reputation matters in experimen- tal markets, but it is difficult to generalize these results.

    "abstract": "Using customs and port authority data, we show that ﬁrms are signiﬁcantly more likely to trade with countries that have a large resident population near their ﬁrm headquarters, and that these connected trades are their most valuable international trades. Using the formation of World War II Japanese internment camps to isolate exogenous shocks to local ethnic populations, we identify a causal link between local networks and ﬁrm trade. Firms are also more likely to acquire target ﬁrms, and report increased segment sales, in connected countries. Our results point to a surprisingly large role of immigrants as economic conduits for ﬁrms. Firms BUY AND Sell Goods in a global marketplace. Nearly half of all S&P 500 ﬁrms’ sales, for instance, come from abroad. Understanding how ﬁrms differentially navigate this marketplace is critical to identifying which ﬁrms will ultimately succeed, and hence how investors should allocate capital among these ﬁrms. Success in a global setting depends not only on the goods or services that ﬁrms provide, but also on the various networks that ﬁrms can exploit to access foreign markets. In this paper we investigate one type of network that ﬁrms can employ in accessing foreign markets, namely, local resident networks. Speciﬁcally, we ex- ploit variation in ethnic population breakdowns across metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in the U.S. To investigate whether local residents’ ties to their home countries play a role in creating important bilateral co",

We ﬁnd a signiﬁcant effect of super- vision on bank risk and large technological scale economies with respect to bank size. Consistent with macroprudential objectives, revealed supervisory preferences dispro- portionately weight larger banks, especially post-2008 when a resource reallocation to larger banks increased risk on average across all banks. Shadow cost estimates show tight resources around the ﬁnancial crisis and counterfactuals indicate that binding constraints have large effects on the distribution of bank outcomes.

    "abstract": "Using unique data on Canadian households, we show that ﬁnancial advisors exert sub- stantial inﬂuence over their clients’ asset allocation, but provide limited customiza- tion. Advisor ﬁxed effects explain considerably more variation in portfolio risk and home bias than a broad set of investor attributes that includes risk tolerance, age, investment horizon, and ﬁnancial sophistication. Advisor effects remain important even when controlling ﬂexibly for unobserved heterogeneity through investor ﬁxed effects. An advisor’s own asset allocation strongly predicts the allocations chosen on clients’ behalf. This one-size-ﬁts-all advice does not come cheap: advised portfolios cost 2.5% per year, or 1.5% more than life cycle funds. THE Life Cycle Asset Allocation PROBLEMis complex. Choosing how to allocate savings across risky assets requires, among other things, an understanding of risk preferences, investment horizon, and the joint dynamics of asset re- turns and labor income.

    "abstract": "Target date funds (TDFs) are designed to provide unsophisticated or inattentive investors with age-appropriate exposures to different asset classes like stocks and bonds. The rise of TDFs has moved a signiﬁcant share of retirement investors into macrocontrarian strategies that sell stocks after relatively good stock market perfor- mance. This rebalancing drives contrarian ﬂows across equity mutual funds held by TDFs, stabilizing their funding, and reduces stock returns for stocks disproportion- ately held by these funds when stock market returns are relatively high. Continued growth in TDFs and similar investment products may dampen stock market volatility and increase the transmission of shocks across asset classes. Over THE Past TWO Decades , one of the most important ﬁnancial innova- tions for the typical American retail investor has been the development and spread of target date funds (TDFs, also called life cycle funds). A TDF is a fund of funds that invests in a number of mutual funds so as to maintain given fractions of its assets in different asset classes, such as stocks and bonds. The speciﬁc asset allocation depends on the time until the investor’s expected re- tirement date, which is the fund’starget date. As time passes and its investors age, the TDF shifts the portfolio allocation automatically from a higher equity share to a lower stock market exposure, following the prescriptions of life cycle models of optimal portfolio choice.1 deis.

    "abstract": "Using a database of more than 1.85 million retail investor transactions over 1991– 1996, we show that these trades are systematically correlated—that is, individuals buy (or sell) stocks in concert. Moreover, consistent with noise trader models, we find that systematic retail trading explains return comovements for stocks with high retail concentration (i.e., small-cap, value, lower institutional ownership, and lower-priced stocks), especially if these stocks are also costly to arbitrage. Macroeconomic news and analyst earnings forecast revisions do not explain these results. Collectively, our findings support a role for investor sentiment in the formation of returns. This Paper Uses THE Trading Records of individual investors to investigate the effect of retail trading on stock returns. Our analysis is based on a sample of more than 1.85 million buy and sell transactions made by over 60,000 retail clients at a large U.S. Discount brokerage firm. In the first part of the study, we examine whether the buy–sell activities of retail investors contain a common directional component. In the second part of the study, we measure changes in investor sentiment based on the direction of these retail trades, and evaluate the impact of retail investor trading on comovement in stock returns. Specifically, we examine which stocks, in the cross section, are most affected by systematic retail trading. Our investigation is motivated by two alternative views of return comove- ments.

    "abstract": "A strategy that selects stocks based on their historical same-calendar-month returns earns an average return of 13% per year. We document similar return seasonalities in anomalies, commodities, and international stock market indices, as well as at the daily frequency. The seasonalities overwhelm unconditional differences in expected returns. The correlations between different seasonality strategies are modest, suggesting that they emanate from different systematic factors. Our results suggest that seasonalities are not a distinct class of anomalies that requires an explanation of its own, but rather that they are intertwined with other return anomalies through shared systematic factors. Figure 1 Plots THE Average Coefficients from cross-sectional regressions of monthly stock returns against one-month returns of the same stock at differ- ent lags. What is remarkable about this plot, which is an updated version of that in Heston and Sadka (2008), is not the momentum up to the one-year mark or the long-term reversals that follow, but rather the positive peaks that disrupt the long-term reversals at every annual lag.

    "abstract": "After a natural experiment is ﬁrst used, other researchers often reuse the setting, examining different outcome variables. We use simulations based on real data to il- lustrate the multiple hypothesis testing problem that arises when researchers reuse natural experiments. We then provide guidance for future inference based on popular empirical settings including difference-in-differences, instrumental variables, and re- gression discontinuity designs. When we apply our guidance to two extensively stud- ied natural experiments, business combination laws and the Regulation SHO pilot, we ﬁnd that many results that were statistically signiﬁcant using single hypothesis testing do not survive corrections for multiple hypothesis testing.

    "title": "Reverse Mortgage Loans: A Quantitative Analysis",
    "abstract": "Reverse mortgage loans (RMLs) allow older homeowners to borrow against housing wealth without moving. Despite rapid growth in this market, only 1.9% of eligible homeowners had RMLs in 2013. In this paper, we analyze reverse mortgages in a calibrated life-cycle model of retirement. The average welfare gain from RMLs is $252 per homeowner, and $1,770 per RML borrower. Bequest motives, uncertainty about health and expenses, and loan costs account for low demand. According to the model, the Great Recession’s impact differs across age, income, and wealth distributions, with a threefold increase in RML demand for lowest income and oldest households. Reverse Mortgage Loans (RMLs) allow older homeowners to borrow against their housing wealth without moving out of the house, while insuring them against signiﬁcant drops in house prices. Despite potentially large beneﬁts to older individuals, many of whom want to stay in their house as long as possible, frequent coverage in the media, and attempts by the Federal Housing Administration, which administers RMLs, to modify the terms to increase their helps ﬁll some of this void. In Nakajima and Telyukova ( 2013), we ﬁnd that older homeowners become borrowing-constrained as they age and these constraints force many retirees to sell their homes when faced with large medical expenses.

    "title": "Reverse Survivorship Bias",
    "abstract": "Mutual funds often disappear following poor performance. When this poor perfor- mance is partly attributable to negative idiosyncratic shocks, funds’ estimated alphas understate their true alphas. This paper estimates a structural model to correct for this bias. Although most funds still have negative alphas, they are not nearly as low as those suggested by the fund-by-fund regressions. Approximately 12% of funds have net four-factor model alphas greater than 2% per year. All studies that run fund-by- fund regressions to draw inferences about the prevalence of skill among mutual fund managers are subject to reverse survivorship bias. THE Typical Survivorship Bias argument starts from the observation that mutual funds often disappear following poor performance. Thus, a study that conditions on fund survival overstates performance. 1 In this paper, I show that the correlation between performance and survival induces an- other bias with the opposite sign: mutual fund alphas estimated from a sur- vivorship bias-free data set are biased downward relative to the true alpha distribution. The mechanics of this bias are transparent in an example in which investors learn about fund alphas. Suppose, ﬁrst, that investors have a prior belief that a fund’s alpha is zero; second, that the true alpha is ﬁxed; and third, that investors abandon a fund (and the fund shuts down) when their posterior be- lief about the fund’s alpha is lower than −¯α.

    "abstract": "This paper develops a model of active asset management in which fund managers may forgo alpha-generating strategies, preferring instead to make negative-alpha trades that enable them to temporarily manipulate investors’ perceptions of their skills. We show that such trades are optimally generated by taking on hidden tail risk, and are more likely to occur when fund managers are impatient and when their trading skills are scalable, and generate a high proﬁt per unit of risk. We propose long-term contracts that deter this behavior by dynamically adjusting the dates on which the manager is compensated in response to her cumulative performance. The last 30 years have witnessed two important developments in ﬁnancial markets. First, ﬁnancial innovation has made it possible to slice and combine a large variety of risks by trading a rich set of ﬁnancial instruments. Second, management of large amounts of capital has been delegated to entities such as hedge funds and bank proprietary desks that are not subject to signiﬁcant trading restrictions and not required to disclose publicly the details of their positions. The amount of capital available to such entities crucially depends on in- vestors’ perceptions of their “alpha,” that is, their ability to generate excess returns above the level of fair compensation for risk. Combined with the rela- tive opaqueness of these entities and their vast risk-taking opportunities, this creates pervasive incentives for money managers. In particular,",

    "title": "Reﬁnancing Risk and Cash Holdings",
    "abstract": "We ﬁnd that ﬁrms mitigate reﬁnancing risk by increasing their cash holdings and saving cash from cash ﬂows. The maturity of ﬁrms’ long-term debt has shortened markedly , and this shortening explains a large fraction of the increase in cash holdings over time. Consistent with the inference that cash reserves are particularly valuable for ﬁrms with reﬁnancing risk, we document that the value of these reserves is higher for such ﬁrms and that they mitigate underinvestment problems. Our ﬁndings imply that reﬁnancing risk is a key determinant of cash holdings and highlight the interdependence of a ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial policy decisions. Both Cash Holdings AND THE maturity structure of long-term debt are ma- jor considerations for ﬁrms, and there are trade-offs in determining each. An important aspect for debt maturity is that shortening maturity increases po- tential costs stemming from reﬁnancing risk. When reﬁnancing, ﬁrms face the risk that changes in market conditions or capital market imperfections could result in reﬁnancing at a signiﬁcantly higher interest rate (Froot, Scharfstein, and Stein (1993)). Firms also face the risk that lenders could underestimate the continuation value of the ﬁrm and not allow reﬁnancing to take place, leading to an inefﬁcient liquidation of the ﬁrm (e.g., Diamond (1991,1993) and Sharpe (1991)) or the sale of important ﬁrm assets at ﬁre-sale prices (Brunnermeier and Y ogo (2009) and Choi, Hackbarth, and Zechner (2013)).

    "title": "Rise of the Machines: Algorithmic Trading",
    "abstract": "We study the impact of algorithmic trading (AT) in the foreign exchange market using a long time series of high-frequency data that identify computer-generated trading activity. We ﬁnd that AT causes an improvement in two measures of price efﬁciency: the frequency of triangular arbitrage opportunities and the autocorrelation of high- frequency returns. We show that the reduction in arbitrage opportunities is associated primarily with computers taking liquidity. This result is consistent with the view that AT improves informational efﬁciency by speeding up price discovery, but that it may also impose higher adverse selection costs on slower traders. In contrast, the reduction in the autocorrelation of returns owes more to the algorithmic provision of liquidity. We also ﬁnd evidence consistent with the strategies of algorithmic traders being highly correlated. This correlation, however, does not appear to cause a degradation in market quality, at least not on average. THE USE OF ALGORITHMICtrading (AT), where computers monitor markets and manage the trading process at high frequency, has become common in major ﬁnancial markets in recent years, beginning in the U.S. Equity market in the 1990s.

    "abstract": "This paper explores the connection between rising intangible capital and the secular upward trend in U.S. Corporate cash holdings. We calibrate a dynamic model with two productive assets—tangible and intangible capital—in which only tangible capital can serve as collateral. We highlight the following points: (i) a shift toward intangible capital shrinks ﬁrms’ debt capacity and leads them to hold more cash, (ii) the effect accounts for three-quarters of the observed trend in average cash ratios, and (iii) it also accounts for the upward trend of cash ratios in the cross-section of small and large ﬁrms and in the aggregate. Public Corporations IN THE United States have undergone fundamen- tal changes over the last decades. On the ﬁnancial side, they have steadily increased cash holdings on their balance sheets, an issue that has attracted wide attention in the popular press, with commentators expressing the con- cern that the “corporate saving glut” might hamper growth of the U.S. Econ- omy and even suggesting that corporate savings be taxed.

    "abstract": "Using a model of market making with inventories based on Biais (1993), we find that investors obtain more favorable execution prices, and they hence invest more, when markets are fragmented. In our model, risk-averse dealers use less aggres- sive price strategies in more transparent markets (centralized) because quote dis- semination alleviates uncertainty about the prices quoted by other dealers and, hence, reduces the need to compete aggressively for order flow. Further, we show that the move toward greater transparency (centralization) may have detrimental effects on liquidity and welfare. Stock Exchanges Everywhere ARE Engaged in a contest for economies of scale and scope. In May 2000, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Bourse announced a merger, along with a joint venture with America's Nasdaq, an agreement that eventually came apart. One of the main obstacles to the merger had been a lack of consensus on trading-system design and regulation. In the design of securities-trading systems, the question of transparency has become a major issue. Regulators disagree among themselves about the desired level of transparency in stock exchange dealings. In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) view is straightforward: \"The Commission has long believed that transparency-the real time, public dissemination of trade and quotation information-plays a fundamental role in the fairness and efficiency of the secondary markets .. .

To identify the effect of hedging and to overcome endogeneity concerns, we exploit the introduction of weather derivatives as an exogenous shock to ﬁrms’ ability to hedge weather risks. This innovation disproportionately beneﬁts weather-sensitive ﬁrms, irrespective of their future investment opportunities. Using this natural exper- iment and data from energy ﬁrms, we ﬁnd that derivatives lead to higher valuations, investments, and leverage. Overall, our results demonstrate that risk management has real consequences on ﬁrm outcomes. AN Important AND Highly debated topic in corporate ﬁnance is whether active risk management policies affect ﬁrm value. Conceptually, the seminal work of Modigliani and Miller ( 1958) shows that, in a frictionless setting, hedging is irrelevant for value.1 This invariance result, however, stands in sharp contrast to the prominence of risk management in practice, and the rapid growth in ﬁnancial innovation (Miller (1986), Tufano (2003)).

    "abstract": "This paper investigates how bond dealers manage core business risk with in- terest rate futures and the extent to which market quality is affected by their selective risk taking. We observe that dealers use futures to take directional bets and hedge changes in their spot exposure. We find that, cross-sectionally, a dealer with longer (shorter) risk exposure sells (buys) a larger amount of ex- posure the next day. However, this risk control takes place via the futures mar- ket and not the spot market. Finally, we find strong support for the price effects of capital constraints emphasized by Froot and Stein (1998).

    "abstract": "We estimate a structural model of bank portfolio lending and ﬁnd that the typical U.S. Community bank reduced its business lending during the global ﬁnancial crisis. The decline in business credit was driven by increased risk overhang effects (consistent with a reduction in the liquidity of assets held on bank balance sheets) and by reduced loan supply elasticities suggestive of credit rationing (consistent with an increase in lender risk aversion). Nevertheless, we identify a group of strategically focused relationship banks that made and maintained higher levels of business loans during the crisis. Small Businesses, Defined AS HAVINGfewer than 500 employees, employ about one-half of the U.S. Labor force and create nearly two-thirds of net new private sector jobs in the United States annually (U.S. Small Business Administration (2014)). Virtually all of these small ﬁrms are privately held and lack access to public capital markets. To ensure access to credit, these informationally opaque businesses establish close borrower–lender relationships with small “commu- nity banks” (e.g., Petersen and Rajan (1994), Berger et al. (1997), Berger et al. (2005)). This conﬂuence of small ﬁrms and small banks is important for macroe- conomic growth both in the United States and elsewhere: Berger, Hasan, and Klapper (2004) ﬁnd a strong positive link between a large, healthy small bank- ing sector and macroeconomic growth across 49 developed and developing nations.

    "abstract": "This paper quantiﬁes how variation in economic activity and inﬂation in the United States inﬂuences the market prices of level, slope, and curvature risks in Treasury markets. We develop a novel arbitrage-free dynamic term structure model in which bond investment decisions are inﬂuenced by output and inﬂation risks that are un- spanned by (imperfectly correlated with) information about the shape of the yield curve. Our model reveals that, between 1985 and 2007, these risks accounted for a large portion of the variation in forward terms premiums, and there was pronounced cyclical variation in the market prices of level and slope risks. A Powerful Implication of virtually all macro-ﬁnance afﬁne term structure models (MTSMs)—reduced-form and equilibrium alike—is that the macro fac- tors that determine bond prices are fully spanned by the current yield curve. 1 That is, the afﬁne mapping between bond yields and the risks in the macroe- conomy in these models can be inverted to express these risk factors as lin- ear combinations of yields. This theoretical macro-spanning condition implies strong and often counterfactual restrictions on the joint distribution of bond yields and the macroeconomy, as well as on how macroeconomic shocks affect term premiums. Consider, for instance, an Mtsm in which the macro variables M t that di- rectly determine bond yields are output growth and inﬂation. Macro spanning implies that these macro variables can be replicated by portfolios of bond yield",

    "abstract": "Green and Hollifield (1992) argue that the presence of a dominant factor would result in extreme negative weights in mean-variance efficient portfolios even in the absence of estimation errors. In that case, imposing no-short-sale con- straints should hurt, whereas empirical evidence is often to the contrary. We reconcile this apparent contradiction. We explain why constraining portfolio weights to be nonnegative can reduce the risk in estimated optimal portfolios even when the constraints are wrong. Surprisingly, with no-short-sale con- straints in place, the sample covariance matrix performs as well as covariance matrix estimates based on factor models, shrinkage estimators, and daily data. Markowitz's (1952, 1959) Portfolio Theory is one of the most important theoretical developments in finance. Mean-variance efficient portfolios play an important role in this theory. Such portfolios constructed using sample moments often in- volve large negative weights in a number of assets. Since negative portfolio weights (short positions) are difficult to implement in practice, most investors impose the constraint that portfolio weights should be nonnegative when con- structing mean-variance efficient portfolios. Green and Hollifield (1992) argue that because a single factor dominates the covariance structure, it would be difficult to dismiss the observed extreme nega- tive and positive weights as being entirely due to the imprecise estimation of the inputs.

    "abstract": "When countries liberalize their stock markets, firms that become eligible for foreign purchase (investible), experience an average stock price revaluation of 15.1%. Since the historical covariance of the average investible firm’s stock return with the lo- cal market is roughly 200 times larger than its historical covariance with the world market, liberalization reduces the systematic risk associated with holding investible securities. Consistent with this fact: (1) the average effect of the reduction in system- atic risk is 6.8 percentage points, or roughly two fifths of the total revaluation; and (2) the firm-specific revaluations are directly proportional to the firm-specific changes in systematic risk. Asset Pricing Theory Predicts that capital will be allocated in such a way that risk-adjusted returns are equalized across assets. Levels of expected stock re- turns should vary cross-sectionally according to the degree of firm exposure to little empirical evidence to support this prediction. Systematic risk factors show little indication that they are priced cross-sectionally, and many firm character- istics that are priced cross-sectionally do not resemble systematic risk (Fama (1991), Cochrane (1999), Campbell (2000)). This paper adopts a different approach to the question of whether risk mat- ters for asset prices. Instead of testing the implication of the theory in levels, the paper focuses on changes in levels. It does so by examining a natural experiment—stock market",

    "abstract": "We identify different sources of risk as important determinants of banks’ corporate structures when expanding into new markets. Subsidiary-based corporate structures beneﬁt from greater protection against economic risk because of afﬁliate-level limited liability, but are more exposed to the risk of capital expropriation than are branches. Thus, branch-based structures are preferred to subsidiary-based structures when expropriation risk is high relative to economic risk, and vice versa. Greater cross- country risk correlation and more accurate pricing of risk by investors reduce the differences between the two structures. Furthermore, a bank’s corporate structure affects its risk taking and afﬁliate size. IN Recent Years , Bank Mergers AND Cross -border entry have intensiﬁed in advanced economies, and international banks have established a substantial presence in several middle-income and developing countries. Entry in these markets has taken a variety of forms, ranging from the acquisition of domestic institutions with extensive branch networks to the establishment of isolated representative ofﬁces aimed at serving niche segments. These movements have reﬂected a wide range of factors, including regulation in the home and host countries, the timing of ﬁnancial liberalization, competitive conditions in the target markets, and risk-management considerations.

    "title": "Risk in Dynamic Arbitrage: The Price Effects",
    "abstract": "I develop an equilibrium model of convergence trading and its impact on asset prices. Arbitrageurs optimally decide how to allocate their limited capital over time. Their ac- tivity reduces price discrepancies, but their activity also generates losses with positive probability, even if the trading opportunity is fundamentally riskless. Moreover, prices of identical assets can diverge even if the constraints faced by arbitrageurs are not binding. Occasionally, total losses are large, making arbitrageurs’ returns negatively skewed, consistent with the empirical evidence. The model also predicts comovement of arbitrageurs’ expected returns and market liquidity. Many Hedge Funds AND Other Financial institutions attempt to exploit the rela- tive mispricing of assets. However, from time to time, the prices of the assets diverge, forcing these institutions (whom I will refer to as convergence traders or arbitrageurs) to unwind some of their positions at spectacular losses. The near-collapse of the Long-Term Capital Management (ltcm) hedge fund in 1998 is frequently cited as an example of this phenomenon. 1 To what extent can these losses be attributed to the actions of arbitrageurs as opposed to un- foreseen shocks? Why do other institutions with liquid capital not eliminate the abnormal returns around these events? In this paper, I develop a theo- retical model to address these questions. I show that such losses can occur in the absence of any shock. I also show that even if the co",

    "title": "Risk, Reputation, and IPO Price Support",
    "abstract": "Immediately following an initial public offering, underwriters often repurchase shares of poorly performing offerings in an apparent attempt to stabilize the price. Using proprietary Nasdaq data, I study the price effects and determinants of price support. Some of the key findings are (1) Stabilization is substantial, inducing price rigidity at and below the offer price; (2) I find no evidence that stocks with larger information asymmetries are stabilized more strongly; (3) Larger underwriters stabilize more, perhaps to protect their reputations with investors; and (4) Investment banks with retail brokerage operations stabilize much more than other banks, inconsistent with the view that stabilization benefits primarily institutional investors. THE Initial Public Offering (IPO) is a critical step for young entrepreneurial firms, providing them access to the public equity market for the first time. Be- cause of this important role, a large literature studies the functioning of the IPO market. Researchers have noted, in particular, two important features of the pricing process: underwriters systematically underprice IPOs and, imme- diately following the offering, underwriters often repurchase shares of poorly performing IPOs in an apparent attempt to stabilize the price. The second phenomenon—price support—has received comparatively little attention even though price support is important to investors and may have an indirect effect on underpricing.

    "title": "Risk-Adjusting the Returns to Venture Capital",
    "abstract": "We adapt stochastic discount factor (SDF) valuation methods for venture capital (VC) performance evaluation. Our approach generalizes the popular Public Market Equivalent (PME) method and allows statistical inference in the presence of cross- sectionally dependent, skewed VC payoffs. We relax SDF restrictions implicit in the PME so that the SDF can accurately reﬂect risk-free rates and returns of public equity markets during the sample period. This generalized PME yields substantially different abnormal performance estimates for VC funds and start-up investments, especially in times of strongly rising public equity markets and for investments with betas far from one. Venture Capital (VC) Investments play an important role in supporting the formation of young enterprises in the economy. Assessing the risk and return from VC investments has thus far proven difﬁcult, however, as payoffs are infrequent, realized over multiple periods with varying time horizons, highly skewed, and cross-sectionally dependent. Linear factor modeling techniques that are common in the mutual funds and hedge funds literature are not easily applicable unless one is willing to impose strong assumptions on the return-generating process as, for example, in Cochrane (2005) and Korteweg and Sorensen (2010). Much of the VC literature therefore relies on heuristic performance metrics such as the Public Market Equivalent (PME) measure of Kaplan and Schoar (2005). While the PME measure has many desirable featur",

    "abstract": "We obtain a large class of discrete-time risk-neutral valuation relationships, or “preference-free” derivatives pricing models, by imposing a simple restriction on the state-price density process. The risk-neutral stock-return and forward-rate dynam- ics are obtained by changing only a location parameter, which can be determined independent of the preference and true location parameters. The Gaussian models of Rubinstein (1976), Brennan (1979), and C ˆamera (2003), and the gamma model of Heston (1993) are all special cases. The model provides simple relationships between expected returns and state-price density parameters analogous to the diffusion case. Rubinstein (1976) Derives THE Black–scholes Formula in a discrete-time model by imposing a restriction on the joint distribution of the asset price and the representative agent’s marginal utility. Similar to the complete-markets diffu- sion result, the option price is independent of the expected stock return and the agent’s preference parameters. As Heston (1993) points out, the noteworthy property is the elimination of three parameters, a stock-price-distribution pa- rameter and two preference parameters (governing subjective time discounting and risk aversion), through the use of stock and bond prices. This so-called risk- neutral valuation relationship (rnvr) has been extended to alternative joint distributions of stock price and marginal utility by Brennan (1979), C ˆamera (2003), and others.

    "title": "Risk-Sharing or Risk-Taking? Counterparty Risk,",
    "abstract": "Derivatives activity, motivated by risk-sharing, can breed risk-taking. Bad news about the risk of an asset underlying a derivative increases protection sellers’ expected liability and undermines their risk-prevention incentives. This limits risk-sharing, creates endogenous counterparty risk, and can lead to contagion from news about the hedged risk to the balance sheet of protection sellers. Margin calls after bad news can improve protection sellers’ incentives and in turn enhance risk-sharing. Central clearing can provide insurance against counterparty risk but must be designed to preserve risk-prevention incentives. Derivatives Activity HAS Grown strongly over the past 15 years. For example, credit default swaps (CDS), bilateral over-the-counter contracts used to insure credit risk, alone saw total notional amounts outstanding increase from around $180 billion in 1998 to a peak of over $60 trillion by mid-2008 (Acharya et al. (2012)). But the insurance provided by derivatives is effective only if counter- parties can honor their contractual obligations. When Lehman Brothers ﬁled for bankruptcy protection in September 2008, for instance, it froze the positions of more than 900,000 derivative contracts (about 5% of all derivative transac- tions globally) in which Lehman Brothers was a party (Fleming and Sarkar (2014)). The above observations lead to several questions. First, what are the inter- actions between counterparty risk and derivatives activity? Second, can risk- sha",

    "title": "Risks for the Long Run: A Potential Resolution",
    "abstract": "We model consumption and dividend growth rates as containing (1) a small long- run predictable component, and (2) fluctuating economic uncertainty (consumption volatility). These dynamics, for which we provide empirical support, in conjunction with Epstein and Zin’s (1989) preferences, can explain key asset markets phenomena. In our economy, financial markets dislike economic uncertainty and better long-run growth prospects raise equity prices. The model can justify the equity premium, the risk-free rate, and the volatility of the market return, risk-free rate, and the price– dividend ratio. As in the data, dividend yields predict returns and the volatility of returns is time-varying. Several KEY Aspects OF Asset Market Data pose a serious challenge to economic models.1 It is difficult to justify the 6% equity premium and the low risk-free rate (see Mehra and Prescott (1985), Weil (1989), and Hansen and Jagannathan (1991)). The literature on variance bounds highlights the difficulty in justify- ing the market volatility of 19% per annum (see Shiller (1981) and LeRoy and Porter (1981)). The conditional variance of the market return, as shown in Bollerslev, Engle, and Wooldridge (1988), fluctuates across time and is very persistent. Price–dividend ratios seem to predict long-horizon equity returns (see Campbell and Shiller (1988)). In addition, as documented in this paper, consumption volatility and future price–dividend ratios are significantly neg- atively correlated—a rise i",

    "title": "Robust Inference for Consumption-Based",
    "abstract": "The reliability of traditional asset pricing tests depends on: (i) the correlations be- tween asset returns and factors; (ii) the time series sample sizeT compared to the number of assets N. For macro-risk factors, like consumption growth, (i) and (ii) are often such that traditional tests cannot be trusted. We extend the Gibbons-Ross- Shanken statistic to test identiﬁcation of risk premia and construct their 95% conﬁ- dence sets. These sets are wide or unbounded whenT and N are close, but show that average returns are not fully spanned by betas whenT exceeds N considerably. Our ﬁndings indicate when meaningful empirical inference is feasible. Classical Consumption-based Asset Pricing Theory relates asset returns to consumption risk. Yet a worrisome phenomenon is that different measures of consumption lead to different empirical ﬁndings. It has been well documented that the canonical consumption measure from the National Income and Prod- uct Accounts (nipa) leads to small correlations between consumption growth and asset returns that could be improved by adopting alternative consump- tion measures, including the three-year consumption measure in Parker and Julliard (2005), the fourth-quarter to fourth-quarter consumption measure in Jagannathan and Wang (2007), the garbage measure in Savov (2011), and the unﬁltered Nipa consumption measure in Kroencke (2017).

    "abstract": "Event studies of market efﬁciency measure earnings surprises using the consensus error (CE), given as actual earnings minus the average professional forecast. If a sub- set of forecasts can be biased, the ideal but difﬁcult to estimate parameter-dependent alternative to CE is a nonlinear ﬁlter of individual errors that adjusts for bias. We show thatCE is a poor parameter-free approximation of this ideal measure. The frac- tion of misses on the same side (FOM), which discards the magnitude of misses, offers a far better approximation.FOM performs particularly well againstCE in predicting the returns of U.S. Stocks, where bias is potentially large.

For instance, commentaries frequently refer to the extent to which earnings missed the consensus forecast in explaining signiﬁcant stock price movements.

    "title": "Role of Managerial Incentives and Discretion",
    "abstract": "Using a comprehensive hedge fund database, we examine the role of managerial incen- tives and discretion in hedge fund performance. Hedge funds with greater managerial incentives, proxied by the delta of the option-like incentive fee contracts, higher lev- els of managerial ownership, and the inclusion of high-water mark provisions in the incentive contracts, are associated with superior performance. The incentive fee per- centage rate by itself does not explain performance. We also find that funds with a higher degree of managerial discretion, proxied by longer lockup, notice, and re- demption periods, deliver superior performance. These results are robust to using alternative performance measures and controlling for different data-related biases. DO Higher Managerial Incentives and greater managerial discretion lead to bet- ter performance? While the prior corporate finance literature has examined this question, the results are hard to interpret given significant endogeneity concerns. We believe that the hedge fund industry offers an interesting setting to examine these issues. The central contribution of this paper is to demonstrate an anonymous referee for insightful comments and suggestions that substantially improved the paper, and Robert F.

    "abstract": "We argue that short sellers affect prices in a significant and systematic man- ner. In particular, we contend that speculative short sales contribute to the weekend effect: The inability to trade over the weekend is likely to cause these short sellers to close their speculative positions on Fridays and reestablish new short positions on Mondays causing stock prices to rise on Fridays and fall on Mondays.We find evidence in support of this hypothesis based on a com- parison of high short-interest stocks and low short-interest stocks, stocks with and without actively traded options, IPOs, zero short-interest stocks, and highly volatile stocks. IN This Paper, we empirically examine whether speculative short sales affect prices in a systematic manner. The focus is on the weekend effect that has re- mained an unexplained anomaly. Beginning with French (1980) and Gibbons and Hess (1981), there is much evidence in support of higher returns on Fridays and lower returns on Mondays. Keim and Stambaugh (1984) find that Friday re- turns are lower when there is Saturday trading. Ariel (1990) finds that a signifi- cantly larger number of stocks rises preholiday than postholiday. Empirical evidence related to more recent periods points to an insignificant weekend effect for large firms but continuance of the weekend effect for an equally weighted in- dex as documented herein.1 Many potential explanations of the weekend effect have been proposed and in- vestigated: measurement errors (Gibbon",

    "title": "Rollover Risk and Credit Risk",
    "abstract": "Our model shows that deterioration in debt market liquidity leads to an increase in not only the liquidity premium of corporate bonds but also credit risk. The latter effect originates from ﬁrms’ debt rollover. When liquidity deterioration causes a ﬁrm to suffer losses in rolling over its maturing debt, equity holders bear the losses while maturing debt holders are paid in full. This conﬂict leads the ﬁrm to default at a higher fundamental threshold. Our model demonstrates an intricate interaction between the liquidity premium and default premium and highlights the role of short-term debt in exacerbating rollover risk. THE Yield Spread OFa ﬁrm’s bond relative to the risk-free interest rate directly determines the ﬁrm’s debt ﬁnancing cost, and is often referred to as its credit spread. It is widely recognized that the credit spread reﬂects not only a default premium determined by the ﬁrm’s credit risk but also a liquidity premium due to illiquidity of the secondary debt market (e.g.,Longstaff, Mithal, and Neis (2005) and Chen, Lesmond, and Wei (2007)). However, academics and policy makers tend to treat both the default premium and the liquidity premium as independent, and thus ignore interactions between them. The ﬁnancial crisis of 2007 to 2008 demonstrates the importance of such an interaction— deterioration in debt market liquidity caused severe ﬁnancing difﬁculties for many ﬁnancial ﬁrms, which in turn exacerbated their credit risk.

    "abstract": "The debt capacity of an asset is the maximum amount that can be borrowed using the asset as collateral. We model a sudden collapse in the debt capacity of good collateral. We assume short-term debt that must be frequently rolled over, a small transaction cost of selling collateral in the event of default, and a small probability of meeting a buy-to-hold investor. We then show that a small change in the asset’s fundamental value can be associated with a catastrophic drop in the debt capacity, the kind of market freeze observed during the crisis of 2007 to 2008. ONE OF THE Many Striking Features OF THE Crisis of 2007 to 2008 was the sudden freeze in the market for the rollover of short-term debt. From an in- stitutional perspective, the inability to borrow overnight against high quality but long-term assets was a market failure that effectively led to the demise of a substantial part of investment banking in the United States. More broadly, it led to the collapse, in the United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries, of banks and other ﬁnancial institutions that had relied on signiﬁ- cant maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities, and, in particular, on the rollover of short-term wholesale debt in the asset-backed commercial paper (abcp) and overnight sale and repurchase (repo) markets.

    "abstract": "A Kyle (1985) model with private information diffusion is used to examine the motivation to spread stock tips. An informed investor with limited investment capacity spreads imprecise rumors to an audience of followers. Followers trade on the advice and move the price. Due to the imprecision of the rumor, the price overshoots with positive probability. This gives the rumormonger the opportunity to trade twice: First when she receives information, then when she knows the price to be overshooting. In equilibrium, rumors are informa- tive and both rumormongers and followers increase their profits at the ex- pense of uninformed liquidity traders. IT IS Difficult TO Dispute that rumors have an important impact on stock prices. Phrases like \"Stock X soared amidst rumors of ... \"can be read or heard almost daily in the popular media.Yet an economic theory about the phenomenon is con- spicuously absent. This article argues that the sources of rumors are small in- formed investors who manipulate prices to increase their information-based profits. Rumormongers can be skillful amateur analysts, investors with access to serendipitous information such as suppliers or clients, or individuals with ac- cess to inside information.

    "abstract": "Stock price increases associated with addition to the S&P 500 Index have been interpreted as evidence that demand curves for stocks slope downward. A key premise underlying this interpretation is that Index inclusion provides no new information about companies' future prospects. We examine this premise by analyzing analysts'earnings per share (eps) forecasts around Index inclusion and by comparing postinclusion realized earnings to preinclusion forecasts. Relative to benchmark companies, companies newly added to the Index experi- ence significant increases in eps forecasts and significant improvements in realized earnings. These results indicate that S&P Index inclusion is not an information-free event. Studies That Examine THE Prices of common stocks when they become included in the Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 Index have appeared regularly in leading finance journals since 1986. Fascination with the effect of S&P Index inclusion on stock prices appears to stem from the possibility that inclusion in the Index is an \"information-free\"event--information free in the sense that S&P makes no claim that inclusion represents an endorsement of the newly included stock's future prospects.1 Indeed, S&P makes an affirmative claim to the contrary: \"Company additions to and deletions from an S&P equity index do not in any way reflect an opinion on the investment merits of the company\" (Standard and Poor's (2002b), p. 1).

    "abstract": "This paper studies how a ﬁnancial system that is organized to efﬁciently create safe assets responds to macroeconomic shocks. Financial intermediaries face a cost of bearing risk, so they choose the least risky portfolio that backs their issuance of risk- less deposits: a diversiﬁed pool of nonﬁnancial ﬁrms’ debt. Nonﬁnancial ﬁrms choose their capital structure to exploit the resulting segmentation between debt and equity markets. Increased safe asset demand yields larger and riskier intermediaries and more levered ﬁrms. Quantitative easing reduces the size and riskiness of interme- diaries and can decrease ﬁrm leverage, despite reducing borrowing costs at the zero lower bound. AN Important Role OF Financial intermediaries is to issue safe, money- like assets, such as bank deposits and money market fund shares. As an empir- ical literature has documented (Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2012), Sunderam (2015), Nagel (2016)), these assets have a low rate of return that is strictly below the risk-free rate they would earn without providing mone- tary services. Agents who can issue these assets therefore raise ﬁnancing on attractive terms, capturing the “demand for safe assets” that pushes their cost of borrowing below that of others. This paper presents a general equilibrium model of how the ﬁnancial system is organized to meet this demand for safe assets and examines how the system as a whole adjusts when the supply or demand for safe assets changes.

    "abstract": "Using new econometric methods, we separately estimate average transaction costs for over 167,000 bonds from a 1-year sample of all U.S. Municipal bond trades. Municipal bond transaction costs decrease with trade size and do not depend significantly on trade frequency. Also, municipal bond trades are substantially more expensive than similar-sized equity trades. We attribute these results to the lack of bond market price transparency. Additional cross-sectional analyses show that bond trading costs increase with credit risk, instrument complexity, time to maturity, and time since issuance. Investors, and perhaps ultimately issuers, might benefit if issuers issued simpler bonds. THE U.S. Municipal Bond Market HAS Very little trade price transparency and almost no quote transparency. While more than 1 million different municipal securities exist, very few securities trade with any regularity in the secondary market. Many of these instruments have complex features that make pricing them difficult for uninformed traders. Not surprisingly, the municipal bond market is not noted for its great liquidity. This study examines secondary trading costs in the U.S. Municipal bond market. We propose and implement new methods for measuring transaction costs—methods that we tailor to fully exploit the data available in these mar- kets.

    "title": "Securitization and Capital Structure in",
    "abstract": "Contrary to recent accounts of off-balance-sheet securitization by ﬁnancial ﬁrms, we show that asset securitization by nonﬁnancial ﬁrms provides a valuable form of ﬁnancing for shareholders without harming debtholders. Using data from ﬁrms’ SEC ﬁlings, we ﬁnd that securitization is attractive to ﬁrms in the middle of the credit quality distribution, which are the ﬁrms with the most to gain. Upon initiation, ﬁrms experience positive abnormal stock returns and zero abnormal bond returns, and largely use the securitization proceeds to repay existing debt. Securitization minimizes ﬁnancing costs by reducing expected bankruptcy costs and providing access to segmented credit markets. Asset-backed Securitization (ABS) has become a signiﬁcant source of ﬁnanc- ing for a wide variety of assets. According to the U.S. Flow of Funds accounts, assets ﬁnanced by issuers of ABS debt approached $4.5 trillion at the end of 2007, rivaling assets ﬁnanced by insurance companies ($6.3 trillion), mutual funds ($8 trillion), and pension funds ($6 trillion).1 Although the majority of We have beneﬁtted from discussions with Ann Rutledge from R&R consulting and Victor Hongwei Yu from Fangda Partners.

    "title": "Securitization and the Declining Impact",
    "abstract": "Low-cost deposits and increased balance sheet liquidity raise banks’ supply of illiquid loans more than loans easily sold or securitized. We exploit the inability of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to purchase jumbo mortgages to identify an exogenous change in liquidity. The volume of jumbo mortgage originations relative to nonjumbo origina- tions increases with bank holdings of liquid assets and decreases with bank deposit costs. This result suggests that the increasing depth of the mortgage secondary mar- ket fostered by securitization has reduced the effect of lender’s financial condition on credit supply. Liquidity Transformation— THE Funding OF Illiquid Loans with liquid deposits— has been viewed as a fundamental role of banks. Diamond and Dybvig (1983), for example, argue that banks improve welfare by allowing depositors to diversify liquidity risk while investing in high return but illiquid projects. In recent years, however, securitization has changed the way banks provide liquidity. 1 While real projects remain illiquid, loans have become more liquid because banks often securitize them, replacing deposits with bonds as a source of finance. Today, more than 60% of outstanding mortgages are securitized. As loans have become more liquid, credit supply has become less sensitive to changes in bank’s financial condition. For example, a bank has the option to finance a liquid loan either with deposits or, via securitization, with funds from capital markets. Liquidity provides a",

    "title": "Securitization, Ratings, and Credit Supply",
    "abstract": "We develop a framework to explore the effect of credit ratings on loan origination. We show that ratings endogenously shift the economy from asignaling equilibrium, in which banks inefﬁciently retain loans to signal quality, toward anoriginate-to- distribute equilibrium with zero retention and inefﬁciently low lending standards. Ratings increase overall efﬁciency, provided that the reduction in costly retention more than compensates for the origination of some negative net present value loans. We study how banks’ ability to screen loans affects these predictions and use the model to analyze commonly proposed policies such as mandatory “skin in the game.” Asset-backed Securitization IS AN Important driver of credit supply (Lout- skina and Strahan (2009), Shivdasani and Wang (2011)). In the United States, since the mid-1990s, there has been substantial growth in the securitization of many asset classes, including mortgages, student loans, commercial loans, auto loans, and credit card debt. This practice has ﬁnanced between 30% and 75% of loan amounts in these consumer lending markets (Gorton and Metrick (2013)), signiﬁcantly increasing households’ access to credit. The development of markets for securitized products has been facilitated in part by credit rating agencies (CRAs), which allow issuers access to a large pool of investors who would otherwise have perceived these securities as opaque and complex (Coval, Jurek, and Stafford (2009), Pagano and Volpin (2010)).

    "title": "Security Design with Investor",
    "abstract": "I study the security design problem of a firm when investors rather than managers have private information about the firm. I find that it is often optimal to issue information-sensitive securities such as equity. The “folklore proposition of debt” from traditional signaling models only goes through if the firm can vary the face value of debt with investor demand. When the firm has several assets, debt backed by a pool of assets is optimal when the degree of competition among investors is low, while equity backed by individual assets is optimal when competition is high. Most Information -based Theories of security design, starting with Myers and Majluf (1984), make the assumption that the issuing firm has private informa- tion about the value of its assets. This leads to a problem for the firm when it attempts to raise capital. Since investors will worry about being sold a lemon, a genuinely good firm that cannot signal its quality properly to the market will face underpricing when it issues securities. Accordingly, the firm will de- sign the securities to minimize this underpricing. This theory has been applied fruitfully to explain the financing behavior of firms. One of the more robust predictions that emerges is the “folklore proposition of debt,” which posits that the firm should issue the least information-sensitive security possible, namely, standard debt. 1 Another prediction that arises is that if the firm has access to several assets, issuing securities backed by the",

    "title": "Security Issue Timing: What Do Managers Know, and When Do They Know It?",
    "abstract": "We study put option sales on company stock by large ﬁrms. An often-cited motivation for these transactions is market timing, and managers’ decision to issue puts should be sensitive to whether the stock is undervalued. We provide new evidence that large ﬁrms successfully time security sales. In the 100 days following put option issues, there is roughly a 5% abnormal stock return, with much of the abnormal return following the ﬁrst earnings release date after the sale. Direct evidence on put option exercises reinforces these ﬁndings: exercise frequencies and payoffs to put holders are abnormally low. During THE 1991 TO 2004 Period, many large U.S. ﬁrms, including Bank of America, Boeing, IBM, McDonald’s, and Microsoft, sold puts on their own stock. Our study is the ﬁrst large-scale empirical analysis of these corporate trans- actions. A put sale can be viewed as a levered bet that the stock price will not drop. Thought of this way, put options offer a unique setting to study market timing by corporations. Our main contribution is to provide strong evidence that large ﬁrms successfully time the market with security sales. Managers can alter investment, ﬁnancing, and other corporate decisions when they believe their ﬁrms’ securities are mispriced. While market timing is the subject of an extensive literature (see Eckbo, Masulis, and Norli (2007) and Baker, Ruback, and Wurgler (2007) for surveys), its importance for corporate behavior is hotly debated and still unresolved.

The issue starts with Hans Stoll's Presi- dential Address, in the usual way. Following this there are three \"state of the field\" papers. Hans Stoll suggested that I approach three leading schol- ars to write papers summarizing the current state of their fields and to give their own perspective on where they think it is likely to go in the future. I asked John Campbell, Suresh Sundaresan, and Luigi Zingales to write these. The three papers after the Presidential Address are the result. The final four papers were chosen from those presented at the Boston meetings. I asked all the session chairs to nominate a paper and also sought advice from some of the discussants. Since the papers were not refereed in the usual way, I asked the discussants to write up their comments so that readers can have a greater appreciation of their strengths and weaknesses. Given the tight publication deadlines there was not sufficient time for authors to make revisions and for discussants to base their comments on the final versions. Instead I asked discussants to base their comments on the version presented at the meetings. In some cases the authors may therefore have already ad- dressed a number of the discussants' comments. I hope you enjoy reading all the papers. 1477",

    "title": "Selective Publicity and Stock Prices",
    "abstract": "I examine how media coverage of good and bad corporate news affects stock prices, by studying the effect of investor relations (IR) ﬁrms. I ﬁnd that IR ﬁrms “spin” their clients’ news, generating more media coverage of positive press releases than negative press releases. This spin increases announcement returns. Around earnings announcements, however, IR ﬁrms cannot spin the news and their clients’ returns are signiﬁcantly lower. This pattern is consistent with positive media coverage increasing investor expectations, creating disappointment around hard information. Using re- porter connections and geographical links, I argue that IR ﬁrms causally affect both media coverage and returns. Does A Company’s Marketing OFits news matter? Few people would be surprised to ﬁnd out that the marketing of shoes or yoghurt affects how these products are perceived by consumers. In ﬁnancial markets, however, simple models of market efﬁciency assume that investors can costlessly receive and process all relevant news signals. In such a setting there is no obvious reason for companies to spend resources to promote or spin a particular news story once it has been disclosed. Indeed, these assumptions also provide no clear role for the media in general. Yet the existence of a large and active business press seems to imply that investors face costs or difﬁculties in either acquiring or processing information about companies. This raises the question of whether the promotion of news stories affect",

    "title": "Self-Fulﬁlling Liquidity Dry-Ups",
    "abstract": "I analyze a model in which holding cash imposes a negative externality: it worsens future adverse selection in markets for long-term assets, which impairs their role for liquidity provision. Adverse selection worsens when potential sellers of long-term assets hold more cash because then fewer sales reﬂect cash needs, and proportionally more sales reﬂect private information. Moreover, future market illiquidity makes current cash holding more appealing. This feedback effect may result in hoarding behavior and a market breakdown, which I interpret as a self-fulﬁlling liquidity dry-up. This mechanism suggests that imposing liquidity requirements on ﬁnancial institutions may backﬁre. A Number OF Policy makers and academics have pointed out unusual cash hoarding behavior by major ﬁnancial institutions since the 2007 to 2009 ﬁ- nancial crisis in general and a further surge in the euro area since the end of 2011. 1 Many have also expressed concerns that such behavior worsens eco- nomic outcomes,2 a topic to which several recent academic studies have been mous referee, an Associate Editor, and Campbell Harvey (the Editor) for detailed feedback that greatly improved the paper.

    "title": "Selling Failed Banks",
    "abstract": "The average Fdic loss from selling a failed bank is 28% of assets. We document that failed banks are predominantly sold to bidders within the same county, with similar assets business lines, when these bidders are well capitalized. Otherwise, they are acquired by less similar banks located further away. We interpret these facts within a model of auctions with budget constraints, in which poor capitalization of some potential acquirers drives a wedge between their willingness and ability to pay for failed banks. We document that this wedge drives misallocation, and partially explains the Fdic losses from failed bank sales. THE Great Recession and its aftermath saw an unprecedented number of banks being taken into receivership by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corpo- ration (fdic) and then sold at auction. These failures impose substantial costs on the Fdic: the average cost of a failed bank sold at auction over the 2007 to 2013 period was approximately 28% of the failed bank’s assets. The resolution of bank failures led to Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) costs of approximately $90 billion, leaving the fund with a negative balance of almost $21 billion at the height of the crisis in 2009 (Davison and Carreon ( 2010)). Small and medium- sized banks, which are typically sold at Fdic auctions, have also been large beneﬁciaries of government programs during this period. 1 For example, the in our sample (Ofﬁce of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset during the recent cri",

    "abstract": "Are market experts prone to heuristics, and do these heuristics transfer across buying and selling domains? We investigate this question using a unique data set of institu- tional investors with portfolios averaging $573 million. A striking ﬁnding emerges: While there is evidence of skill in buying, selling decisions underperform substan- tially, even relative to random-selling strategies. This holds despite the similarity be- tween the two decisions in frequency, substance, and consequences for performance. Evidence suggests an asymmetric allocation of cognitive resources such as attention can explain the discrepancy: We document a systematic, costly heuristic process for selling but not for buying. A Large Literature Demonstrates That Market participants use heuristics and are prone to systematic biases.

    "abstract": "At-scale ﬁeld experiments at major U.K. Banks show that automatic enrollment into “just-in-time” text alerts reduces unarranged overdraft and unpaid item charges 17% to 19% and arranged overdraft charges 4% to 8%, implying annual market-wide sav- ings of £170 million to £240 million. Incremental beneﬁts from “early-warning” alerts are statistically insigniﬁcant, although economically signiﬁcant effects are not ruled out. Prior to the experiments, over half of overdrafts could have been avoided by using lower-cost liquidity available in savings and credit card accounts. Alerts help consumers achieve less than half of these potential savings.

Moreover, sensation- seeking managers trade more frequently, actively, and unconventionally, and prefer lottery-like stocks. We show further that some investors are themselves susceptible to sensation seeking and that sensation-seeking investors fuel the demand for sensation- seeking managers.

    "title": "Sensation Seeking, Overconfidence,",
    "abstract": "This study analyzes the role that two psychological attributes—sensation seeking and overconfidence—play in the tendency of investors to trade stocks. Equity trading data from Finland are combined with data from investor tax filings, driving records, and mandatory psychological profiles. We use these data, obtained from a large population, to construct measures of overconfidence and sensation seeking tendencies. Controlling for a host of variables, including wealth, income, age, number of stocks owned, marital status, and occupation, we find that overconfident investors and those investors most prone to sensation seeking trade more frequently. Recently, Empiricists Have Begun to study and document that behavioral at- tributes influence trading volume. 1 This evidence is compelling but it is diffi- cult to conclusively argue that particular traits influence trading without bet- ter data. Much of the data used in the past to establish a connection between behavioral attributes and trading are experimental or aggregated across in- dividuals.

    "abstract": "Recent work suggests that sentiment traders shift from safer to more specula- tive stocks when sentiment increases. Exploiting these cross-sectional patterns and changes in share ownership, we ﬁnd that sentiment metrics capture institutional rather than individual investors’ demand shocks. We investigate the underlying eco- nomic mechanisms and ﬁnd that common institutional investment styles (e.g., risk management, momentum trading) explain a signiﬁcant portion of the relation be- tween institutions and sentiment. THE Investor Sentiment Literature TYPICALLYassumes that irrational individ- ual investors are the source of sentiment-based demand shocks that drive prices from value. For instance, the earliest academic article focusing on this issue uses odd-lot trading to identify demand shocks attributed to “public psychol- ogy” relative to the more rational views of “New York Stock Exchange members” (Drew et al.

We ﬁnd that hedge funds in the top decile ranked by sentiment beta outperform those in the bottom decile by 0.59% per month on a risk-adjusted basis, with the spread being larger among skilled funds. We also ﬁnd that about 10% of hedge funds have sentiment timing skill that positively correlates with fund sentiment beta and contributes to fund performance. Our ﬁndings show that skilled hedge funds can earn high returns by predicting and exploiting sentiment changes rather than betting against mispricing. Sentiment , OR THE Distorted Beliefs of irrational traders, is ﬁckle. Changes in sentiment can lead to both mispricing and a reduction in arbitrage activity .

    "abstract": "This paper studies the effect of sentiment on asset prices during the 20th century (1905 to 2005). As a proxy for sentiment, we use the fraction of positive and neg- ative words in two columns of ﬁnancial news from the New York Times. The main contribution of the paper is to show that, controlling for other well-known time-series patterns, the predictability of stock returns using news’ content is concentrated in recessions. A one standard deviation shock to our news measure during recessions predicts a change in the conditional average return on the Djia of 12 basis points over one day. Shiller (2000) Argues That THE news media plays an important role in setting the stage for market moves and provoking them. His conjecture is that investors follow the printed word even though much of it is pure hype, suggesting that market sentiment is driven by news’ content. More formally, Tetlock ( 2007) shows that the number of negative words in the “Abreast of the Market” column of the Wall Street Journal predicts stock returns at the daily frequency from 1984 to 1999. This paper revisits both Shiller’s conjecture and Tetlock’s evidence by study- ing ﬁnancial market news from the New York Times over the 1905 to 2005 period. The literature from psychology and economics, which we review be- low, suggests that investors’ sensitivity to news is most pronounced when they are going through hard times.

    "title": "Sequential Learning, Predictability, and Optimal",
    "abstract": "This paper ﬁnds statistically and economically signiﬁcant out-of-sample portfolio ben- eﬁts for an investor who uses models of return predictability when forming optimal portfolios. Investors must account for estimation risk, and incorporate an ensemble of important features, including time-varying volatility, and time-varying expected returns driven by payout yield measures that include share repurchase and issuance. Suggest that this is largely due to omitting time-varying volatility and estimation risk. We also document the sequential process of investors learning about parame- ters, state variables, and models as new data arrive. Equity Return Predictability is widely considered a stylized fact: theory in- dicates that expected returns should time-vary and numerous studies ﬁnd supporting evidence. For example, Lettau and Ludvigson (2001, p. 842) argue “it is now widely accepted that excess returns are predictable by variables such as dividend-price ratios, earnings-price ratios, dividend-earnings ratios, and an assortment of other ﬁnancial indicators.” Evidence for predictable volatility is so strong that it is rarely debated, with predictability introduced via short- run persistence and long-run mean reversion. This predictability should be important for investors when making portfolio decisions, as investors should “time” the investment set, increasing allocations when expected returns are high and/or volatility is low. A surprising recent ﬁnding questions the evidence",

    "title": "Shaping Liquidity: On the Causal Effects",
    "abstract": "Can managers inﬂuence the liquidity of their ﬁrms’ shares? We use plausibly exoge- nous variation in the supply of public information to show that ﬁrms actively shape their information environments by voluntarily disclosing more information than reg- ulations mandate and that such efforts improve liquidity. Firms respond to an exoge- nous loss of public information by providing more timely and informative earnings guidance. Responses appear motivated by a desire to reduce information asymmetries between retail and institutional investors. Liquidity improves as a result and in turn increases ﬁrm value. This suggests that managers can causally inﬂuence their cost of capital via voluntary disclosure. Improved Liquidity Raises Aﬁrm’s market value by lowering its discount rate (see Amihud and Mendelson (1986, 1989), Brennan and Subrahmanyam (1996), and Amihud (2002)). While liquidity is often viewed as resulting from market- makers’ and investors’ actions in an exogenously speciﬁed information environ- ment, we examine if corporate managers can actively inﬂuence the liquidity of their ﬁrms’ shares. An important channel through which they might do so is voluntary disclosure. Theoretical models such as Diamond (1985)a n d Diamond and Verrecchia (1991) show that managers may commit to disclose more information than mandated by market regulations in order to reduce in- formation asymmetry among their investors. Consistent with this view, recent survey evidence suggests that managers p",

    "title": "Share Issuance and Cross-sectional Returns",
    "abstract": "Post-1970, share issuance exhibits a strong cross-sectional ability to predict stock returns. This predictive ability is more statistically significant than the individual predictive ability of size, book-to-market, or momentum. Our finding is related to nouncements, seasoned equity offerings, and stock mergers, although our results re- main strong even after exclusion of the data used in these studies. We estimate the issuance relation pre-1970 and find no statistically significant predictive ability for most holding periods. Whether OR NOT Long -RUN Stock returns following seasoned equity offerings, share repurchase announcements, and stock mergers reflect mispricing is the subject of debate in the finance literature. Proponents of the mispricing story include Loughran and Ritter (1995), who argue that long-run stock performance following seasoned equity offerings reflects negative abnormal returns, Iken- berry, Lakonishok, and Vermaelen (1995, 2000) who show that share repur- chase announcements precede positive abnormal returns, and Loughran and Vijh (1997), who argue that acquirers that complete stock mergers experience negative long-run excess returns. All of these studies focus on returns with holding periods of 3 or more years. The behavioral interpretation of this liter- ature is that firms issue equity when it is overvalued and retire equity when it is undervalued. However, inference from long-run studies is very sensitive to statistical specification issues. Mitche",

    "abstract": "We show that characteristics of stock issuers can be used to forecast important com- mon factors in stocks’ returns such as those associated with book-to-market, size, and industry. Speciﬁcally, we use differences between the attributes of stock issuers and repurchasers to forecast characteristic-related factor returns. For example, we show that large ﬁrms underperform after years when issuing ﬁrms are large relative to repurchasing ﬁrms. While our strongest results are for portfolios based on book- to-market (i.e., HML), size (i.e., SMB), and industry, our approach is also useful for forecasting factor returns associated with distress, payout policy, and proﬁtability. IT IS Well Known That Firms that issue stock subsequently earn low returns rel- ative to other ﬁrms. Loughran and Ritter (1995) ﬁnd that ﬁrms issuing equity in either an IPO or a SEO underperform signiﬁcantly post-offering. Loughran and Vijh (1997) show that acquirers in stock-ﬁnanced mergers later underper- form. Conversely, Ikenberry, Lakonishok, and Vermaelen (1995) ﬁnd that ﬁrms repurchasing shares have abnormally high returns. Fama and French (2008a) and Pontiff and Woodgate (2008) synthesize these results using a compos- ite measure of net stock issuance: they show that the change in split-adjusted shares outstanding is a strong negative predictor of returns in the cross-section. The relation between share issuance and returns has also been documented at the market level: Baker and Wurgler (2000) show tha",

    "title": "Share Repurchases and Pay-Performance",
    "abstract": "I show that share repurchases increase pay-performance sensitivity of employee com- pensation and lead to greater employee effort and higher stock prices. Consistent with the model, I find that after repurchases, employees and managers receive fewer stock option and equity grants, and that the market reacts favorably to repurchase an- nouncements when employees have many unvested stock options. Managers are more likely to initiate share repurchases when employees hold a large stake in the firm. Moreover, since employees are forced to bear more risk in firms that repurchase shares, they exercise their stock options earlier and receive higher compensation. IN Recent Years , Corporations Have Distributed increasing amounts of cash to shareholders through share repurchases. As reported by the Securities Data Corporation (SDC), the aggregate amount spent by companies on stock repur- chase programs grew from $38 billion in 1993 to over $100 billion in 2003, peaking in 1998 with an astounding value of $230 billion. In this paper I explore how share repurchases affect existing employee com- pensation contracts and offer a new explanation for the popularity of stock buybacks. Specifically, at the time of a share repurchase, employees are not permitted to tender their unvested shares, and the pay-performance sensitiv- ity of their contracts increases. This increased employee ownership (measured by the dollar change in compensation per dollar change in firm value) creates stronger incen",

Con- sistent with a lock-in effect for acquisition premiums, results suggest a unique positive association between shareholder capital gains taxes for individual in- vestors and acquisition premiums for taxable acquisitions, which is mitigated by target institutional ownership.

    "title": "Short Sellers and Financial Misconduct",
    "abstract": "We examine whether short sellers detect ﬁrms that misrepresent their ﬁnancial state- ments, and whether their trading conveys external costs or beneﬁts to other investors. Abnormal short interest increases steadily in the 19 months before the misrepresen- tation is publicly revealed, particularly when the misconduct is severe. Short selling is associated with a faster time-to-discovery, and it dampens the share price inﬂation that occurs when ﬁrms misstate their earnings. These results indicate that short sell- ers anticipate the eventual discovery and severity of ﬁnancial misconduct. They also convey external beneﬁts, helping to uncover misconduct and keeping prices closer to fundamental values. Short Selling IS A Controversial Activity. Detractors claim that short sell- ers undermine investors’ conﬁdence in ﬁnancial markets and decrease market liquidity. For example, a short seller can spread false rumors about a ﬁrm in which he has a short position and proﬁt from the resulting decline in the stock price.1 Advocates, in contrast, argue that short selling facilitates market efﬁciency and the price discovery process. Investors who identify overpriced ﬁrms can sell short, thereby incorporating their unfavorable information into market prices.

Pilot ﬁrms’ discretionary accruals and likelihood of marginally beating earnings targets decrease during this period, and revert to pre-experiment levels when earnings information. These results indicate that short selling, or its prospect, curbs earnings management, helps detect fraud, and improves price efﬁciency. And fraud before they are publicly revealed.1 But this is for earnings manip- ulation that has already taken place. Might short selling also constrain ﬁrms’ incentives to manipulate or misrepresent earnings in the ﬁrst place? That is, does the prospect of short selling help improve the quality of ﬁrms’ ﬁnancial reporting? In this paper we exploit a randomized experiment that allows us to address this question.

    "abstract": "Short-sales practices in the Hong Kong stock market are unique in that only stocks on a list of designated securities can be sold short. By analyzing the price effects follow- ing the addition of individual stocks to the list, we find that short-sales constraints tend to cause stock overvaluation and that the overvaluation effect is more dramatic for individual stocks for which wider dispersion of investor opinions exists. These findings are consistent with Miller’s (1977) intuition and other optimism models. We also document higher volatility and less positive skewness of individual stock returns when short sales are allowed. THE Question OF HOW Short Sales Impact capital markets is highly controversial, with short-sale regulations varying widely across countries and capital mar- kets.1 Although short selling has been carried out for years in major financial markets around the world, its effects on market efficiency, especially on pricing efficiency, remain of interest to financial researchers. Miller (1977) theorizes that in the presence of short-sales constraints, secu- rity prices tend to reflect a more optimistic valuation than the average opinion of potential investors and thus tend to be upward biased. This overvaluation argument is based on two conditions: (1) A security’s short sales are either pro- hibited or costly, and (2) investors have heterogeneous beliefs or information about the security’s value. The underlying intuition is quite straightforward. Pessimistic",

    "abstract": "Most regulators around the world reacted to the 2007–09 crisis by imposing bans on short selling. These were imposed and lifted at different dates in different countries, often targeted different sets of stocks, and featured varying degrees of stringency . We exploit this variation in short-sales regimes to identify their effects on liquidity , price discovery , and stock prices. Using panel and matching techniques, we ﬁnd that bans (i) were detrimental for liquidity , especially for stocks with small capitalization and no listed options; (ii) slowed price discovery , especially in bear markets, and (iii) failed to support prices, except possibly for U.S. ﬁnancial stocks. “The emergency order temporarily banning short selling of ﬁnancial stocks will restore equilibrium to markets” (Christopher Cox, SEC Chairman, 19 September 2008, SEC News Release 2008–211). “Knowing what we know now, I believe on balance the commission would not do it again.

    "title": "Short-Selling Prior to Earnings Announcements",
    "abstract": "This paper examines short-sales transactions in the five days prior to earnings an- nouncements of 913 Nasdaq-listed firms. The tests provide evidence of informed trading in pre-announcement short-selling because they reveal that abnormal short- selling is significantly linked to post-announcement stock returns. Also, the tests indi- cate that short-sellers typically are more active in stocks with low book-to-market val- uations or low SUEs. The levels of pre-announcement short-selling, however, mostly appear to reflect firm-specific information rather than these fundamental financial characteristics. We believe that these results should encourage financial market reg- ulators to consider providing more extensive and timely disclosures of short-selling to investors. Corporate Earnings Announcements are scheduled events at which firms of- ten disclose surprising news. Investors with private information can establish short positions in the stocks of firms they expect to report negative earnings surprises or refrain from shorting shares in companies that might announce positive surprises. This paper employs a unique data set to explore key fea- tures of short-sales transactions prior to the earnings announcements of 913 Nasdaq firms in the fall of 2000. The data set consists of records from Nasdaq’s Automated Confirmation Transaction Service (ACT), which processed the vast preponderance of transactions in these stocks during that interval.

    "title": "Short-Term Debt as Bridge Financing: Evidence",
    "abstract": "We analyze why ﬁrms use nonintermediated short-term debt by studying the com- mercial paper (CP) market. Using a comprehensive database of CP issuers and is- suance activity, we show that ﬁrms use CP to provide start-up ﬁnancing for capital investment. Firms’ CP issuance is driven by a desire to minimize transaction costs associated with raising capital for new investment. We show that ﬁrms with high rollover risk are less likely to enter the CP market, borrow less CP , and borrow more from bank credit lines. Further, CP is often reﬁnanced with long-term bond issuance to reduce rollover risk. Short-term Debt IS an important component of ﬁrms’ capital structure and can take the form of either bank debt or nonintermediated short-term debt such as commercial paper (CP). While substantial evidence exists on the role of ﬁnancial intermediation when ﬁrms ﬁnance through bank debt 1,m u c hl e s s is known about how ﬁrms make capital structure choices with respect to non- intermediated short-term debt.

    "abstract": "We study short-maturity (“weekly”) S&P 500 index options, which provide a direct way to analyze volatility and jump risks. Unlike longer-dated options, they are largely insensitive to the risk of intertemporal shifts in the economic environment. Adopting a novel seminonparametric approach, we uncover variation in the negative jump tail risk, which is not spanned by market volatility and helps predict future equity returns. As such, our approach allows for easy identiﬁcation of periods of heightened concerns about negative tail events that are not always “signaled” by the level of market volatility and elude standard asset pricing models. Recent Years Have Witnessed A Rapid Increase in the trading of short-dated options. For instance, S&P 500 option contracts with one week or less to matu- rity have seen their share of trading at the Chicago Board of Options Exchange (cboe) rise steadily from about 10% in early 2010 to almost 30% in mid-2015. Furthermore, the volume in shorter-dated options is disproportionately skewed toward out-of-the-money (OTM) options relative to the pattern for longer-dated options. Similar developments are observed in many other index option mar- kets and for options on individual names.

    "title": "Shorting in Speculative Markets",
    "abstract": "In models of trading with heterogeneous beliefs following Harrison-Kreps, short sell- ing is prohibited and agents face constant marginal costs-of-carry. The resale option guarantees that prices exceed buy-and-hold prices and the difference is identiﬁed as a bubble. We propose a model where risk-neutral agents face asymmetric increas- ing marginal costs on long and short positions. Here, agents also value an option to delay, and a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation quantiﬁes the inﬂuence of costs on prices. An unexpected decrease in shorting costs may deﬂate a bubble, linking ﬁnan- cial innovations that facilitated shorting of mortgage-backed securities to the collapse of prices. AS Kindleberger AND Aliber (2005) Observe, many classical economists ar- gued that the purchase of securities for resale rather than for investment income is what drives asset price bubbles. To explain such speculation in a dy- namic equilibrium model, Harrison and Kreps ( 1978) study risk-neutral agents with ﬂuctuating heterogeneous beliefs. In their model, long positions can be ﬁ- nanced at a constant interest rate and short selling is ruled out. The buyer of an asset thus acquires both a stream of future dividends and an option to resell, which together with ﬂuctuating beliefs guarantees that speculators are willing to pay more for an asset than they would pay if they were forced to hold the asset to maturity, that is, what risk-neutral investors are will- ing to pay to be able to speculate.

    "abstract": "Derivatives enjoy special status in bankruptcy: they are exempt from the automatic stay and effectively senior to virtually all other claims. We propose a corporate ﬁnance model to assess the effect of these exemptions on a ﬁrm’s cost of borrowing and in- centives to engage in derivative transactions. While derivatives are value-enhancing risk management tools, seniority for derivatives can lead to inefﬁciencies: it trans- fers credit risk to debtholders, even though this risk is borne more efﬁciently in the derivative market. Seniority for derivatives is efﬁcient only if it provides sufﬁcient cross-netting beneﬁts to derivative counterparties that provide hedging services. Derivative Contracts ENJOYspecial status under U.S. Bankruptcy law: deriva- tive counterparties are exempt from the automatic stay, and—through netting, closeout, and collateralization provisions—they are generally able to imme- diately collect payment from a defaulted counterparty.1 Taken together, these special provisions make derivative counterpartieseffectively seniorto almost all other claimants in bankruptcy. The costs and beneﬁts of this special treatment are the subject of considerable debate and disagreement among legal scholars, policy makers, and regulators, which is reﬂected in substantial differences in the bankruptcy treatment of derivatives across jurisdictions.2 Editor, Viral Acharya, Jun Kyung Auh, Ulf Axelson, Ken Ayotte, Mike Burkart, Doug Diamond, Darrell Dufﬁe, Yaniv Grinstein, Oliver",

    "abstract": "This paper analyzes mutual-fund performance from an investor’s perspective. We study the portfolio-choice problem for a mean-variance investor choosing among a risk-free asset, index funds, and actively managed mutual funds. To solve this problem, we employ a Bayesian method of performance evaluation; a key innova- tion in our approach is the development of a flexible set of prior beliefs about managerial skill. We then apply our methodology to a sample of 1,437 mutual funds. We find that some extremely skeptical prior beliefs nevertheless lead to economically significant allocations to active managers. Actively Managed Equity Mutual Funds have trillions of dollars in assets, collect tens of billions in management fees, and are the subject of enormous attention from investors, the press, and researchers. For years, many ex- perts have been saying that investors would be better off in low-cost pas- sively managed index funds. Notwithstanding the recent growth in index funds, active managers still control the vast majority of mutual-fund assets. Are any of these active managers worth their added expenses? Should in- vestors avoid all actively managed mutual funds? Since Jensen ~1968!, most studies have found that the universe of mu- tual funds does not outperform its benchmarks after expenses. 1 This evidence indicates that the average active mutual fund should be avoided.

The results suggest that, at the margin, in- vestors in start-ups should place more weight on the business (“the horse”) than on the management team (“the jockey”). The results also inform theories of the firm. Since Coase (1937), Economists Have Attempted TO Understand why firms exist and what constitutes firms.1 Despite the long history of theory and empirical work, there is little systematic or noncase evidence concerning what constitutes a firm when it is very young and how a young firm evolves to a mature company. In this paper, we provide such evidence by studying 50 venture capital (VC)- financed firms from early business plan to initial public offering (IPO) to public company (3 years after the IPO). We explore financial performance, line of business, point(s) of differentiation, nonhuman capital assets, growth strategy, Kauffman Foundation, the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, the Olin Foundation through in Security Prices.

    "title": "Simple Forecasts and Paradigm Shifts",
    "abstract": "We study the asset pricing implications of learning in an environment in which the true model of the world is a multivariate one, but agents update only over the class of simple univariate models. Thus, if a particular simple model does a poor job of forecasting over a period of time, it is discarded in favor of an alternative simple model. The theory yields a number of distinctive predictions for stock returns, generating forecastable variation in the magnitude of the value-glamour return differential, in volatility, and in the skewness of returns. We validate several of these predictions empirically. IN Attempting TO Make Even THE Most Basic Kinds of forecasts, we can find our- selves inundated with a staggering amount of potentially relevant raw data. To take a specific example, suppose you are interested in forecasting how General Motors’ stock will perform over the next year. The first place you might turn is to GM’s annual report, which is instantly available online. GM’s 2004 10-K filing is more than 100 pages long, and is filled with dozens of tables as well as a myriad of other facts, footnotes, and esoterica. And this is just the begin- ning. With a few more clicks, it is easy to find countless news stories about GM, assorted analyst reports, and so forth. How is one to proceed in the face of all this information? Both common sense, as well as a large literature in psychology, suggest that people simplify the fore- casting problem by focusing their attention on a sm",

I characterize the theory axiomatically , and derive its properties and unique predictions relative to canonical models. By designing and running theoretically motivated experiments, I document that people value simplicity in ways not fully captured by existing mod- els that study risk premia in ﬁnancial markets. Participants’ risk premia increase as complexity increases, holding moments ﬁxed; their dominance violations increase in complexity; their behavior is predicted by simplicity’s characterizing axiom; and their complexity aversion is heterogeneous in cognitive ability . None of expected util- ity theory , cumulative prospect theory , prospect theory , rational inattention, sparsity , salience, or probability weighting that differs by number of outcomes fully capture the experimental ﬁndings. I generalize the underlying theory to additionally capture broader measures of complexity , including obfuscation, computation, and language ef- fects.

    "abstract": "The largest commercial bank stocks, ranked by total size of the balance sheet, have signiﬁcantly lower risk-adjusted returns than small- and medium-sized bank stocks, even though large banks are signiﬁcantly more levered. We uncover a size factor in the component of bank returns that is orthogonal to the standard risk factors, including small minus big, which has the right covariance with bank returns to explain the average risk-adjusted returns. This factor measures size-dependent exposure to bank- speciﬁc tail risk. These ﬁndings are consistent with government guarantees that protect shareholders of large banks, but not small banks, in disaster states. Banks ARE Different From Nonfinancial FIRMSin many ways. One of the most salient distinctions is that banks are subject to bank runs during banking panics and crises, not just by depositors, but also by other creditors (see Gor- ton and Metrick (2012)a n dD u f ﬁ e(2010)). Because ﬁnancial crises are high marginal utility states for the average investor, the expected return on bank stocks should be especially sensitive to variation in the anticipated ﬁnancial disaster recovery rates of bank shareholders related to bank size, the regu- latory regime, implicit government guarantees, and other characteristics. For example, if a bank is deemed too big to fail, the expected return on its stock is lower in equilibrium than that of smaller banks holding the exact same assets in their portfolio because the government absorbs some of",

    "title": "Sizing Up Repo",
    "abstract": "To understand which short-term debt markets experienced “runs” during the ﬁnan- cial crisis, we analyze a novel data set of repurchase agreements (repo), that is, loans between nonbank cash lenders and dealer banks collateralized with securities. Con- sistent with a run, repo volume backed by private asset-backed securities falls to near zero in the crisis. However, the reduction is only $182 billion, which is small relative to the stock of private asset-backed securities as well as the contraction in asset-backed commercial paper. While the repo contraction is small in aggregate, it disproportionately affected a few dealer banks. Short-term Debt is widely understood to be a central factor in ﬁnancial crises. Short-term debt can leave borrowers vulnerable to runs (Diamond and Dybvig (1983)) and rollover risk (Cole and Kehoe ( 2000), He and Xiong ( 2012)), which can lead to or exacerbate ﬁnancial crises. In practice, there are many differ- ent forms of short-term debt, including bank deposits, short-term government debt, commercial paper, and repurchase agreements. Financial crises in the United States during the 1800s, as well as the Great Depression, centered on runs on bank deposits (Bernanke ( 1983), Gorton ( 1988)). The Penn Central ﬁnancial crisis of 1970 centered on the commercial paper market (Calomiris (1994)).

The combination of skill and scalability produces a value- added that (i) is positive for the majority of funds, and (ii) approaches its optimal level after an adjustment period (possibly due to investor learning).

    "abstract": "What determines securitization levels, and should they be regulated? To address these questions we develop a model where originators can exert unobservable effort to increase expected asset quality, subsequently having private information regard- ing quality when selling ABS to rational investors. Absent regulation, originators may signal positive information via junior retentions or commonly adopt low reten- tions if funding value and price informativeness are high. Effort incentives are below ﬁrst-best absent regulation. Optimal regulation promoting originator effort entails a menu of junior retentions or one junior retention with size decreasing in price infor- mativeness. Zero retentions and opacity are optimal among regulations inducing zero effort. Over THE Past TWO decades securitization markets have been an important source of funding for ﬁnancial and nonﬁnancial corporations. As shown in Table I, mortgage-related and non-mortgage-related asset-backed securities (ABS) accounted for over 30% of U.S. Bond market issuance each year from 1996 to 2011, with the percentage exceeding 50% from 2002 to 2005. Table II shows that non-mortgage-related ABS cover a diverse range of as- sets outside the housing sector, including equipment, auto loans and leases, credit card debt, student loans, and trade receivables.

This ap- proach applies the Merton (1974) credit model to the returns on entrepreneurial business credit card debt securitizations and solves for the implied equity returns for the small businesses owned by the cardholders. The estimated small business eq- uity premium is 10.74%. The standard deviation of small business equity returns is 56.37%. We validate the methodology by applying it to investment-grade corporate bonds and recovering a public equity premium of 6.17%. What IS THE Expected Return from investing in a small business? This question is of fundamental importance since the total value of noncorporate entrepreneurial equity in the United States is more than $12 trillion and rep- resents a substantial fraction of aggregate household wealth. 1 Furthermore, the Small Business Administration reports that there were 31.7 million small businesses in the United States in 2020, collectively accounting for 47.1% of total private sector employment. 2 Despite the importance of this question, however, relatively little is known about small business equity returns.

    "abstract": "The returns that institutional investors realize from private equity differ dramatically across institutions. Using detailed, hitherto unexplored records, we document large heterogeneity in the performance of investor classes: endowments’ annual returns are nearly 21% greater than average. Analysis of reinvestment decisions suggests that endowments (and to a lesser extent, public pensions) are better than other investors at predicting whether follow-on funds will have high returns. The results are not primarily due to endowments’ greater access to established funds, since they also hold for young or undersubscribed funds. Our results suggest that investors vary in their sophistication and potentially their investment objectives. Over THE Past Three Decades, institutional investors have controlled an increas- ing share of the U.S. Equity markets with their share of U.S. Public equity markets exceeding the 50% threshold in 1995 (Gompers and Metrick (2001)).1 A significant and growing literature in financial economics seeks to under- stand the investment decisions of institutional investors and the differences between institutions and other classes of investors, especially individual in- vestors. Gompers and Metrick (2001) document, for example, that institutional investors hold stocks that have greater market capitalization, are more liq- uid, have higher book-to-market ratios, and realize lower returns in the prior year.

    "abstract": "During the 2008–2009 ﬁnancial crisis, ﬁrms with high social capital, as measured by corporate social responsibility (CSR) intensity, had stock returns that were four to seven percentage points higher than ﬁrms with low social capital. High-CSR ﬁrms also experienced higher proﬁtability, growth, and sales per employee relative to low- CSR ﬁrms, and they raised more debt. This evidence suggests that the trust between a ﬁrm and both its stakeholders and investors, built through investments in social capital, pays off when the overall level of trust in corporations and markets suffers a negative shock. “The present ﬁnancial crisis springs from a catastrophic collapse in conﬁ- dence . . .

    "title": "Social Interaction and Stock-Market",
    "abstract": "We propose that stock-market participation is influenced by social interaction. In our model, any given “social” investor finds the market more attractive when more of his peers participate. We test this theory using data from the Health and Retirement Study, and find that social households—those who interact with their neighbors, or attend church—are substantially more likely to invest in the market than non-social households, controlling for wealth, race, education, and risk tolerance. Moreover, con- sistent with a peer-effects story, the impact of sociability is stronger in states where stock-market participation rates are higher. IN 1998, 48.9 Percent OF American Households owned stock, either directly, or through mutual funds or various retirement vehicles such as 401(k) plans or in light of the historically high returns to investing in the stock market—it actually represents an all-time peak in the United States, and a dramatic in- crease from prior years. For example, less than a decade earlier, in 1989, the participation rate stood at only 31.6 percent; even as late as 1995 it was at just 40.4 percent. What are the underlying determinants of the stock-market participation rate? This question is an important one, for a number of reasons. First, as argued by, for example, Mankiw and Zeldes (1991), Heaton and Lucas (1999), Vissing-Jorgensen (1999), and Brav, Constantinides, and Gezcy (2002), the par- ticipation rate can have a direct effect on the equity premium; thus an",

    "title": "Social Security and Trends in Wealth Inequality",
    "abstract": "Recent inﬂuential work ﬁnds large increases in inequality in the United States based on measures of wealth concentration that notably exclude the value of social insur- ance programs. This paper shows that top wealth shares have not changed much over the last three decades when Social Security is properly accounted for. This is because Social Security wealth increased substantially from $7.2 trillion in 1989 to $40.6 tril- lion in 2019 and now represents nearly 50% of the wealth of the bottom 90% of the wealth distribution. This ﬁnding is robust to potential changes to taxes and beneﬁts in response to system ﬁnancing concerns. AS Work Dating Back TO Feldstein (1976) shows, wealth is more equally distributed when it includes the value of accrued Social Security beneﬁts. This paper highlights that including Social Security changes not only the level of wealth inequality, but its evolution as well. Speciﬁcally, although recent stud- ies show that wealth inequality in the United States has risen in the last several decades (Saez and Zucman (2016)), we ﬁnd that top wealth shares have not changed much between 1989 and 2019 when Social Security is prop- erly taken into account.

    "abstract": "Debt initial public offerings (IPOs) represent a major shift in a firm's financing policy by both extending debt maturity and altering the public-private debt mix. In contrast to findings for seasoned debt offerings, we document a significantly neg- ative stock price response to debt IPO announcements. This result is consistent with debt maturity and debt ownership structure theories. The equity wealth ef- fect is negatively related to the offer's maturity, and positively related to the de- gree of bank monitoring. We find that firms with less information asymmetry and firms with higher growth opportunities experience a less adverse stock price response. The decision to access the public debt market for the first time represents a major change in a firm's financing policy. An initial public debt offer alters the firm's debt structure in two significant ways. Not only does this policy choice affect the firm's debt ownership structure, by altering its mix of pub- lic relative to private debt, but it also extends the average debt maturity of the firm substantially. This study provides empirical evidence on the valid- ity of some important debt structure theories by focusing on the information content of initial public debt offers (debt IPOs). Two major strands of theories have evolved in the literature. The debt ownership choice theories model corporate choice of private and public debt mix (see, e.g., Fama (1985), Diamond (1991a), and Rajan (1992)), while the other set of theor",

We measure dispersion with entropy and dynamics with horizon depen- dence, the difference between entropy over several periods and one.

This exercise reveals tension between a model’s ability to generate one-period entropy , which should be large, and horizon dependence, which should be small.

Recursive utility and habits are different preference orderings, but they share one important feature: dynamics play a central role.

    "abstract": "We document that governments whose local currency debt provides them with greater hedging beneﬁts actually borrow more in foreign currency . We introduce two features into a government’s debt portfolio choice problem to explain this ﬁnding: risk-averse lenders and lack of monetary policy commitment. A government without commitment chooses excessively countercyclical inﬂation ex post, which leads risk-averse lenders to require a risk premium ex ante. This makes local currency debt too expensive from the government’s perspective and thereby discourages the government from borrow- i n gi ni t so w nc u r r e n c y . HOW Should Governments Finance Their deﬁcits? A long-standing liter- ature argues that governments should borrow using state-contingent debt to smooth ﬂuctuations in domestic consumption or tax rates (for instance, Barro (1979), Bohn (1990), Calvo and Guidotti (1993), Barro (2003), Lustig, Sleet, and Yeltekin (2008)). Debt that is denominated in a country’s own currency is thought to help achieve this desired state-contingency because the government can vary inﬂation to reduce the real debt burden in bad times. In this paper, we demonstrate empirically that governments whose local cur- rency (LC) debt provides them with greater hedging beneﬁts actually borrow relatively more in foreign currency (FC).

    "abstract": "We present a model of sovereign debt in which, contrary to conventional wisdom, government defaults are costly because they destroy the balance sheets of domestic banks. In our model, better ﬁnancial institutions allow banks to be more leveraged, thereby making them more vulnerable to sovereign defaults. Our predictions: govern- ment defaults should lead to declines in private credit, and these declines should be larger in countries where ﬁnancial institutions are more developed and banks hold more government bonds. In these same countries, government defaults should be less likely. Using a large panel of countries, we ﬁnd evidence consistent with these predictions. WHY DO Governments REPAYtheir debts? Conventional wisdom holds that they do so to avoid foreign sanctions or exclusion from international ﬁnancial (or goods) markets (see Eaton and Fern´andez (1995) for a survey). In reality, sanc- tions are rarely observed and market exclusion is short lived. Therefore, to rationalize the relatively low frequency of defaults, recent work argues that defaults must also impose a large cost on the domestic economy and that for helpful suggestions from seminar participants at the American Finance Association meetings, the Nber meetings in International Finance and Macroeconomics, the “Sovereign Debt Risk” national Economics and Finance in Montevideo, and the Workshop in Institutions, Contracts, and Growth in Barcelona.

    "title": "Sparse Signals in the Cross-Section of Returns",
    "abstract": "This paper applies the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (lasso) to make rolling one-minute-ahead return forecasts using the entire cross-section of lagged returns as candidate predictors. The Lasso increases both out-of-sample ﬁt and forecast-implied Sharpe ratios. This out-of-sample success comes from identifying predictors that are unexpected, short-lived, and sparse. Although the Lasso uses a statistical rule rather than economic intuition to identify predictors, the predictors it identiﬁes are nevertheless associated with economically meaningful events: the Lasso tends to identify as predictors stocks with news about fundamentals. Financial Economists Have Been LOOKINGfor variables that predict future stock returns for as long as there have been ﬁnancial economists. For example, Banz (1981) uses market cap to predict future returns, Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) use lagged returns, and Cohen and Frazzini (2008) use customer earnings surprises. To ﬁnd these sorts of variables, researchers have to solve two distinct problems: identiﬁcation and estimation.

    "abstract": "We develop a novel approach for measuring bank specialization using granular data on borrower activities and apply it to Peruvian exporters and their banks. We ﬁnd that borrowers seek credit from banks that specialize in their export destinations, both when expanding exports and when exporting to new countries. Firms experi- encing country-speciﬁc export demand shocks adjust borrowing disproportionately from specialized banks. Specialized bank credit supply shocks affect exports dispro- portionately to countries of specialization. Our results demonstrate that ﬁrm credit demand is bank- and activity-speciﬁc, which reduces banking competition and affects the transmission and ampliﬁcation of shocks through the banking sector. A Long -standing View IN Financial Economics is that competition in bank credit markets is reduced by the informational monopoly obtained from interacting repeatedly with opaque borrowers.1 Relationship lending confers an information advantage relative to other lenders that is ﬁrm-speciﬁc and developed over time. Absent this ﬁrm-speciﬁc advantage, it is often presumed that bank credit markets are competitive. In this paper, we challenge this view and posit that competition in bank credit markets can be substantially reduced through an alternative mecha- nism: bank specialization.

    "abstract": "This paper explores the structural differences and relative goodness-of-fits of af- fine term structure models (ATSMs). Within the family of ATSMs there is a trade- off between flexibility in modeling the conditional correlations and volatilities of the risk factors. This trade-off is formalized by our classification of N-factor affine family into N + 1 non-nested subfamilies of models. Specializing to three-factor ATSMs, our analysis suggests, based on theoretical considerations and empirical evidence, that some subfamilies of ATSMs are better suited than others to explain- ing historical interest rate behavior. IN Specifying A Dynamic Term Structure MODEL-one that describes the co- movement over time of short- and long-term bond yields-researchers are inevitably confronted with trade-offs between the richness of econometric representations of the state variables and the computational burdens of pric- ing and estimation. It is perhaps not surprising then that virtually all of the empirical implementations of multifactor term structure models that use time series data on long- and short-term bond yields simultaneously have focused on special cases of \"affine\" term structure models (ATSMs). An Atsm accommodates time-varying means and volatilities of the state variables through affine specifications of the risk-neutral drift and volatility coeffi- cients. At the same time, ATSMs yield essentially closed-form expressions for zero-coupon-bond prices (Duffie and Kan (1996)), which",

    "abstract": "We analyze the specifications of option pricing models based on time-changed L ´evy processes. We classify option pricing models based on the structure of the jump com- ponent in the underlying return process, the source of stochastic volatility, and the specification of the volatility process itself. Our estimation of a variety of model spec- ifications indicates that to better capture the behavior of the S&P 500 index options, we need to incorporate a high frequency jump component in the return process and generate stochastic volatilities from two different sources, the jump component and the diffusion component. Although Researchers Have Proposed and tested various extensions of the Black and Scholes (1973) model, they have yet to find a model that can capture both the time series and cross-sectional properties of equity index options. The sig- nificance of this task is enormous. First, to price and hedge options, we need to explain the behavior of option prices across strike prices and maturities. Second, the information from the options market helps us understand the un- derlying asset return dynamics as the option price behavior reveals important information about the conditional risk-neutral distributions of the underlying return over different horizons. In this paper, we present a unified framework that synthesizes the ongoing efforts to identify the “true” dynamics of the underlying return process by per- forming a specification analysis of option pricing models.

    "title": "Speculative Betas",
    "abstract": "The risk and return trade-off, the cornerstone of modern asset pricing theory, is often of the wrong sign. Our explanation is that high-beta assets are prone to speculative overpricing. When investors disagree about the stock market’s prospects, high-beta assets are more sensitive to this aggregate disagreement, experience greater diver- gence of opinion about their payoffs, and are overpriced due to short-sales constraints. When aggregate disagreement is low, the Security Market Line is upward-sloping due to risk-sharing. When it is high, expected returns can actually decrease with beta. We conﬁrm our theory using a measure of disagreement about stock market earnings. There IS Compelling Evidence that high-risk assets often deliver lower ex- pected returns than low-risk assets. This is contrary to the risk-return trade-off at the heart of neoclassical asset pricing theory. The high-risk, low-return puz- zle literature, which dates back to Black ( 1972) and Black, Jensen, and Scholes (1972), shows that low-risk stocks, as measured by a stock’s comovement with the stock market or Sharpe’s ( 1964) capital asset pricing model (capm) beta, have signiﬁcantly outperformed high-risk stocks over the last 30 years. 1 Baker, Bradley, and Wurgler (2011) further show that since January 1968 the cumula- tive performance of stocks has actually been declining with beta.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the stock market reaction to sudden changes in investor mood. Motivated by psychological evidence of a strong link between soccer outcomes and mood, we use international soccer results as our primary mood variable. We find a significant market decline after soccer losses. For example, a loss in the World Cup elimination stage leads to a next-day abnormal stock return of−49 basis points. This loss effect is stronger in small stocks and in more important games, and is robust to methodological changes. We also document a loss effect after international cricket, rugby, and basketball games. This Paper Employs A Novel Mood Variable , international soccer results, to inves- tigate the effect of investor sentiment on asset prices. Using a cross-section of 39 countries, we find that losses in soccer matches have an economically and statistically significant negative effect on the losing country’s stock market. For example, elimination from a major international soccer tournament is as- sociated with a next-day return on the national stock market index that is 38 basis points lower than average. We also document a loss effect after interna- tional cricket, rugby, and basketball games. On average, the effect is smaller in magnitude for these other sports than for soccer, but is still economically and statistically significant. We find no evidence of a corresponding effect after wins for any of the sports that we study. Controlling for the pre-game expected out-",

    "title": "Spurious Regressions in Financial Economics?",
    "abstract": "Even though stock returns are not highly autocorrelated, there is a spurious regression bias in predictive regressions for stock returns related to the clas- sic studies of Yule (1926) and Granger and Newbold (1974). Data mining for pre- dictor variables interacts with spurious regression bias. The two effects reinforce each other, because more highly persistent series are more likely to be found significant in the search for predictor variables. Our simulations sug- gest that many of the regressions in the literature, based on individual predic- tor variables, may be spurious. Predictive Models FOR Common Stock Returns have long been a staple of financial economics. Early studies, reviewed by Fama (1970), used such models to examine market efficiency. Stock returns are assumed to be predictable, based on lagged instrumental variables, in the current conditional asset pricing literature. Stan- dard lagged variables include the levels of short-term interest rates, payout-to- price ratios for stock market indexes, and yield spreads between low-grade and high-grade bonds or between long- and short-term bonds. Many of these variables behave as persistent, or highly autocorrelated, time series. This paper studies the finite sample properties of stock return regressions with persistent lagged regressors. We focus on two issues. The first is spurious regression, analogous to Yule (1926) and Granger and Newbold (1974). These stu- dies warned that spurious relations may be found betwe",

We find instead that aftermarket activities are less transparent and include stimulating demand through short covering and restricting supply by penalizing the flipping of shares. In more than half of IPOs, a short position of an average 10.75 percent of shares offered is covered in 22 transactions over 16.6 days in the aftermarket, resulting in a loss of 3.61 percent of underwriting fees. Underwriters manage price support activities by using a combination of aftermarket short covering, penalty bids, and the selective use of the overallot- ment option. Researchers ARE Still Trying TO Understand the price behavior of initial pub- lic offerings (IPOs).1 Short-run underpricing and long-run overpricing con- tinue to be a puzzle. Underpricing refers to the initial trading of IPOs above the offer price in the immediate aftermarket, whereas overpricing refers to tion to the specific activities of underwriters in the aftermarket that are likely to have an impact on IPO price performance. These interventions by underwriters are not well understood because of both lack of data and lack of transparency in industry practices.

    "title": "Stapled Finance",
    "abstract": "“Stapled ﬁnance” is a loan commitment arranged by a seller in an M&A setting. Whoever wins the bidding contest has the option (not the obligation) to accept this loan commitment. We show that stapled ﬁnance increases bidding competition by subsidizing weak bidders, who raise their bids and thereby the price that strong bidders (who are more likely to win) must pay. The lender expects not to break even and must be compensated for offering the loan. This reduces but does not eliminate the seller’s beneﬁt. It also implies that stapled ﬁnance loans will show poorer performance than other buyout loans. “stapled Finance,” a tool that is increasingly common both in the United States and in Europe (see the next section for institutional details) is a loan commit- ment that is “stapled” onto an offering memorandum, by the investment bank advising the seller in an M&A transaction. It is available at pre-speciﬁed terms to whoever wins the bidding contest for the asset or ﬁrm that is being put up for sale, but the winner is under no obligation to accept the loan offer. Practi- tioners and observers regard stapled ﬁnance as a tool that reduces transaction frictions: It makes ﬁnancing available to all parties, if needed, thereby reduc- ing risk and delays to the sale process and potentially increasing the pool of bidders. In this paper, we show that stapled ﬁnance also affects the bidding itself by making it more competitive. We begin by showing that an appropriately designed stapled ﬁnanc",

    "abstract": "We propose a theory of reputation to explain how investors rationally respond to mutual fund star ratings. A fund’s performance is determined by its information advantage, which can be acquired but decays stochastically. Investors form beliefs about whether the fund is informed based on its past performance. We refer to such beliefs as fund reputation, which determines fund ﬂows. As performance changes continuously, equilibrium fund reputation may take discrete values only and thus can be labeled with stars. Star upgrades thus imply reputation jumps, leading to discrete increases in ﬂows and expected performance, although stars do not provide new information. Mutual Fund Flows ARE Closely associated with fund star ratings. Analyzing Morningstar ratings, Del Guercio and Tkac ( 2008) show that when a fund is upgraded from the four-star group to the ﬁve-star group, on average, it observes positive abnormal ﬂows of 53% to 61%. 1Reuter and Zitzewitz ( 2015) further ﬁnd that bottom ﬁve-star funds tend to receive signiﬁcantly more Associate Editor, and three anonymous referees for insightful comments and suggestions.

    "abstract": "This study examines whether local stock returns vary with local business cycles in a predictable manner. We ﬁnd that U.S. State portfolios earn higher future returns when state-level unemployment rates are higher and housing collateral ratios are lower. During the 1978 to 2009 period, geography-based trading strategies earn annualized risk-adjusted returns of 5%. This abnormal performance reﬂects time-varying sys- tematic risks and local-trading induced mispricing. Consistent with the mispricing explanation, the evidence of predictability is stronger among ﬁrms with low visibility and high local ownership. Nonlocal domestic and foreign investors arbitrage away the predictable patterns in local returns in 1 year. ARE Stock Returns Predictable ? This fundamental question has intrigued both academics and practitioners for more than a century (e.g., Watts (1880), Nelson (1903), Dow (1920), Cowles (1933)), and the evidence so far has been mixed.1 In this paper, we investigate heterogeneity in return predictability along a geographical dimension and provide an alternative perspective on the return predictability debate.

Several U.S. States installed deposit insurance laws before the creation of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and those laws applied only to some depository institutions within those states. These experiments present a unique testing ground for investigating the effect of deposit insurance. We show that deposit insurance removed market discipline constraining uninsured banks. Taking advantage of World War I’s rise in world agricultural prices, insured banks increased their insolvency risk and competed aggressively for deposits. When prices fell after the war, the insurance systems collapsed and suffered high losses.

    "abstract": "This paper analyzes optimal executive compensation contracts when managers are loss averse. We calibrate a stylized principal-agent model to the observed contracts of 595 CEOs and show that this model can explain observed option holdings and high base salaries remarkably well for a range of parameterizations. We also derive and calibrate the general shape of the optimal contract that is increasing and convex for medium and high outcomes and that drops discontinuously to the lowest possible payout for low outcomes. Finally, we identify the critical features of the loss-aversion model that render optimal contracts convex. IN This Paper WE Analyze A Simple Contracting Model IN which the manager is loss averse and we explore the extent to which the model’s predictions are consistent with salient features of observed compensation contracts. We param- eterize the model using standard assumptions and then compare the contracts generated by the model with those actually observed for a large sample of U.S. CEOs. Our main conclusion is that for a range of parameterizations, a principal-agent model with loss-averse agents generates convex compensation contracts and can approximate observed contracts better than the standard model based on risk aversion that is widely used in the literature. The theoretical literature on executive compensation contracts is largely based on contracting models in which shareholders (the principal) are risk neu- tral and the manager (the agent) is risk aver",

    "abstract": "We propose a theory of the “proﬁtability” anomaly. In our model, investors forecast future proﬁts using a signal and sticky belief dynamics. In this model, past proﬁts forecast future returns (the proﬁtability anomaly). Using analyst forecast data, we measure expectation stickiness at the ﬁrm level and ﬁnd strong support for three additional model predictions: (1) analysts are on average too pessimistic regarding the future proﬁts of high-proﬁt ﬁrms, (2) the proﬁtability anomaly is stronger for stocks that are followed by stickier analysts, and (3) the proﬁtability anomaly is stronger for stocks with more persistent proﬁts. A Number OF Studies IN THE asset pricing literature document the existence of stock return predictability: Several stock-level characteristics beyond market betas signiﬁcantly predict future stock returns. However, the origin of such ab- normal returns, and how they can exist in equilibria without being arbitraged away, is subject to debate. One strand of the literature interprets abnormal returns as risk premia (see, for instance, Cochrane ( 2011)), which implies that they are only seemingly abnormal. Other authors attribute abnormal returns to behavioral biases combined with limits to arbitrage (see, e.g., Barberis and Thaler ( 2003) or references therein, such as Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam (1998, 2001) and Hirshleifer ( 2001)).

Using difference-in- buyer Credit increased home sales by 490,000 (9.8%), median home prices by $2,400 into homeownership by 53%. The policy response did not reverse immediately. Instead, demand comes from several years in the future: induced buyers were three years younger in 2009 than typical ﬁrst-time buyers. The program’s market-stabilizing beneﬁts likely exceeded its direct stimulus effects. IN THE Aftermath OF Thegreat Recession, the U.S. Housing market suffered extraordinary distress (Figure 1). As house price growth slowed, a shortage of prospective homebuyers caused vacancies to rise and housing inventory to double from 2004 to 2006 and remain at historic levels through 2008. The boom coincided with a rapid, widespread rise in household debt secured by real estate (Mian and Suﬁ (2015)).

    "title": "Stochastic Convenience Yield Implied from",
    "abstract": "We characterize a three-factor model of commodity spot prices, convenience yields, and interest rates, which nests many existing specifications. The model allows con- venience yields to depend on spot prices and interest rates. It also allows for time- varying risk premia. Both may induce mean reversion in spot prices, albeit with very different economic implications. Empirical results show strong evidence for spot-price level dependence in convenience yields for crude oil and copper, which implies mean reversion in prices under the risk-neutral measure. Silver, gold, and copper exhibit time variation in risk premia that implies mean reversion of prices under the physical measure. Commodity Derivatives Markets Have Witnessed tremendous growth in recent years. A variety of models have been proposed for pricing commodity deriva- tives such as futures and options.1 In his presidential address, Schwartz (1997) selects and empirically compares three models. His empirical results suggest that three factors, spot prices, interest rates, and convenience yields, are nec- essary to capture the dynamics of futures prices. Further, models that accom- modate mean reversion in spot prices under the risk-neutral measure seem desirable, although in that case, Schwartz argues that commodities cannot be seen as “an asset in the usual sense,” 2 because they do not satisfy the standard no-arbitrage condition for traded assets. Below, we develop a three-factor Gaussian model of commodity futures",

    "abstract": "I develop an interest rate model with separate factors driving innovations in bond yields and their covariances. It features a flexible and tractable affine structure for bond covariances. Maximum likelihood estimation of the model with panel data on swaptions and discount bonds implies pricing errors for swaptions that are almost always lower than half of the bid–ask spread. Furthermore, market prices of interest rate caps do not deviate significantly from their no-arbitrage values implied by the swaptions under the model. These findings support the conjectures of Collin-Dufresne and Goldstein (2003), Dai and Singleton (2003), and Jagnnathan, Kaplin, and Sun (2003). THE Turmoil IN THE Bond Markets and increased interest rate volatility since the 1980s have provided a boost for the rapid growth of interest rate hedging vehicles such as swaptions and caps. As these interest rate derivatives become liquid, researchers start using their prices to evaluate term-structure models. There is a rich cross section of swaptions and caps. Their prices are sensitive to the volatilities and correlations of bond yields and contain valuable information regarding the market’s view on the evolution of the yield curve beyond that contained in interest rate data such as Treasury bonds, Eurodollar futures, or swap rates. Recent studies find that it is challenging to explain the market prices of swap- tions and caps under many popular term-structure models, including those that by construction fit",

    "abstract": "Consistent with recent theoretical models where binding capital constraints lead to sudden liquidity dry-ups, we ﬁnd that negative market returns decrease stock liquidity, especially during times of tightness in the funding market. The asymmetric effect of changes in aggregate asset values on liquidity and commonality in liquidity cannot be fully explained by changes in demand for liquidity or volatility effects. We document interindustry spillover effects in liquidity, which are likely to arise from capital constraints in the market making sector. We also ﬁnd economically signiﬁcant returns to supplying liquidity following periods of large drops in market valuations. Illiquidity has received much attention. Liquidity dry-ups are argued to occur because market participants engage in panic selling (a demand effect), ﬁnan- cial intermediaries withdraw from providing liquidity (a supply effect), or both. In this paper, we explore empirically what happens to market liquidity after large market declines and whether supply effects exist in equity markets. It is difﬁcult to establish the actual identity of ﬁnancial intermediaries in equity markets as they could be specialists, ﬂoor traders, limit order providers, or other traders like hedge funds. Furthermore, the actual positions and balance sheets of these intermediaries are unknown. We therefore take an encompass- ing approach by investigating the impact of market declines on various dimen- sions of liquidity, including: (1) time",

    "abstract": "A stock market liberalization is a decision by a country's government to allow foreigners to purchase shares in that country's stock market. On average, a coun- try's aggregate equity price index experiences abnormal returns of 3.3 percent per month in real dollar terms during an eight-month window leading up to the im- plementation of its initial stock market liberalization. This result is consistent with the prediction of standard international asset pricing models that stock mar- ket liberalization may reduce the liberalizing country's cost of equity capital by allowing for risk sharing between domestic and foreign agents. A stock market liberalization is a decision by a country's government to allow foreigners to purchase shares in that country's stock market. Standard international asset pricing models (JAPMs) predict that stock market liber- alization may reduce the liberalizing country's cost of equity capital by al- lowing for risk sharing between domestic and foreign agents (Stapleton and Subrahmanyan (1977), Errunza and Losq (1985), Eun and Janakiramanan (1986), Alexander, Eun, and Janakiramanan (1987), and Stulz (1999a, 1999b)). This prediction has two important empirical implications for those emerg- ing countries that liberalized their stock markets in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

    "abstract": "In the recent ﬁnancial crisis we saw liquidity in the stock market drying up as a precursor to the crisis in the real economy. We show that such effects are not new; in fact, we ﬁnd a strong relation between stock market liquidity and the business cycle. We also show that investors’ portfolio compositions change with the business cycle and that investor participation is related to market liquidity. This suggests that systematic liquidity variation is related to a “ﬂight to quality” during economic down- turns. Overall, our results provide a new explanation for the observed commonality in liquidity. IN Discussions OF THE Current ﬁnancial crisis, much is made of the apparent causality between a decline in the liquidity of ﬁnancial assets and the economic crisis. In this paper we show that such effects are not new; changes in the liquidity of the U.S. Stock market have been coinciding with changes in the real economy at least since the Second World War. In fact, stock market liquidity is a very good “leading indicator” of the real economy. Using data for the United States over the period 1947 to 2008, we document that measures of stock market liquidity contain leading information about the real economy, even after controlling for other asset price predictors.

    "abstract": "This paper employs Swedish data on households’ stock holdings to investigate how consumption responds to changes in stock market returns. We instrument the actual capital gains and dividend payments with past portfolio weights. Unrealized capital gains lead to a marginal propensity to consume of 23% for the bottom 50% of the wealth distribution and about 3% for the top 30% of the wealth distribution. House- hold consumption is signiﬁcantly more responsive to dividend payouts across all parts of the wealth distribution. Our ﬁndings are consistent with households treating cap- ital gains and dividends as separate sources of income. IN THE United States , Stockholdings Represent the largest share of ﬁ- nancial assets on households’ balance sheets, reaching more than $32 trillion (with about $15 trillion in nonretirement accounts), which makes them com- parable in importance to the stock of housing wealth. Given their prominence, movements in stock prices and dividend payments might signiﬁcantly affect households’ consumption and savings decisions.

    "abstract": "We quantify the role of global production linkages in explaining spillovers of U.S. Monetary policy shocks on country-sector stock returns. We estimate a structural spatial autoregression (SAR) model that is consistent with an open-economy produc- tion network framework. Using the SAR model, we decompose the total impact of U.S. Monetary policy on global stock returns into direct and network effects. Nearly 70% of the total impact is due to the network effect of global production linkages. Empirical counterfactuals show that shutting down global production linkages halves the total impact of U.S. Monetary policy shocks. THE Recent ERA OF Globalization witnessed (i) increased correlation of stock market returns across countries (Dutt and Mihov (2013)a n dJ a c h (2017)), and (ii) greater cross-country trade integration as ﬁrms’ production chains spread across the world (Johnson and Noguera (2017)).

    "abstract": "We show that consumption-based asset pricing models with time-separable prefer- ences generate realistic amounts of stock price volatility if one allows for small de- viations from rational expectations. Rational investors with subjective beliefs about price behavior optimally learn from past price observations. This imparts momen- tum and mean reversion into stock prices. The model quantitatively accounts for the volatility of returns, the volatility and persistence of the price-dividend ratio, and the predictability of long-horizon returns. It passes a formal statistical test for the overall ﬁt of a set of moments provided one excludes the equity premium. Investors, their conﬁdence and expectations buoyed by past price increases, bid up speculative prices further , thereby enticing more investors to do the same, so that the cycle repeats again and again.

    "abstract": "We develop a stationary model of the aggregate stock market featuring both dividend- paying and no-dividend stocks within a familiar, parsimonious consumption-based equilibrium framework. We ﬁnd that such a simple feature leads to profound implications supporting several stock market empirical regularities that leading consumption-based asset pricing models have difﬁculty reconciling. Namely, the pres- ence of no-dividend stocks in the stock market leads to a lower correlation between stock market returns and the aggregate consumption growth rate, a nonmonotonic and even negative relation between the stock market risk premium and its volatility, and a downward-sloping term structure of equity risk premia. THE Aggregate Stock Market Contains both dividend-paying and no- dividend stocks.1 Existing asset pricing models, however, overlook this compo- sition and typically model the stock market as being made up of only dividend- paying stocks. We provide the ﬁrst general equilibrium model of the stock market in which both types of stocks coexist.

    "abstract": "We show that ﬁrm liability structure and associated cash ﬂows matter for ﬁrm behavior and that ﬁnancial market participants price stocks accordingly. Stock price reactions to monetary policy announcements depend on the type and maturity of debt issued by the ﬁrms and the forward guidance provided by the Fed, both at and away from the zero lower bound. Further, the marginal stock market participant knows the current liability structures of ﬁrms and does not rely on rules of thumb. The cash ﬂow exposure at the time of monetary policy actions predicts future invest- ment, assets, and net worth, clearly violating the Modigliani-Miller theorem. AN Influential Branch OF THE Macrofinance literature focuses on ﬁnancial conditions to amend standard macroeconomic models to better ﬁt the observed effects of monetary policy on real activity and helps explain why ﬁnancial markets are so important and ﬁnancial crises so destructive. These models, in which the Modigliani-Miller theorem fails, collectively require cash in the ﬁrm to be more valuable than cash outside it.

    "abstract": "We explore the cross-sectional pricing of volatility risk by decomposing equity market volatility into short- and long-run components. Our finding that prices of risk are negative and significant for both volatility components implies that investors pay for insurance against increases in volatility, even if those increases have little persistence. The short-run component captures market skewness risk, which we interpret as a measure of the tightness of financial constraints. The long-run component relates to business cycle risk. Furthermore, a three-factor pricing model with the market return and the two volatility components compares favorably to benchmark models. When Market Volatility IS Stochastic , intertemporal models predict that asset risk premia are not only determined by covariation of returns with the mar- ket return, but also by covariation with the state variables that govern market volatility. To study this prediction, we model the log-volatility of the market portfolio as the sum of a short- and a long-run volatility component. This ap- proach parsimoniously captures shocks to systematic risk at different horizons. Market volatility is a significant cross-sectional asset pricing factor as shown by Ang et al.

In this framework, the timing and terms of takeovers are endogenous and result from value-maximizing decisions. The implications of the model for abnormal announcement returns are consistent with the available empirical evidence. In addition, the model generates new predictions regarding the dynamics of firm-level betas for the period surrounding control transactions. Using a sample of 1,086 takeovers of publicly traded U.S. Firms between 1985 and 2002, we present new evidence on the dynamics of firm-level betas, which is strongly supportive of the model’s predictions. Decisions That Affect THE Scope OF A Firm are among the most important faced by management and among the most studied by academics. Mergers and acquisi- tions are classic examples of such decisions. While there exists a rich literature that examines why firms should merge or restructure, we still know very lit- tle about the asset pricing implications of these major corporate events.

We causally tie this fact to the Fed by study- ing intermeeting target changes, Fed funds futures, and internal Board of Governors meetings. The Fed has affected the stock market via unexpectedly accommodating policy, leading to large reductions in the equity premium. Evidence suggests system- atic informal communication of Fed ofﬁcials with the media and ﬁnancial sector as a channel through which news about monetary policy has reached the market. Does THE Federal Reserve Have a substantial impact on the stock market? How much of realized stock returns can be attributed to the Fed, if any? And what is the economic mechanism behind any impact? Prior work on these questions focuses on Federal Open Market Committee (fomc) announcement days (starting with Bernanke and Kuttner (2005)) or the 24-hour period just before scheduled Fomc announcements (Lucca and Moench (2015)).

    "abstract": "We develop a simple approach to valuing stocks in the presence of learning about average profitability. The market-to-book ratio (M/B) increases with un- certainty about average profitability, especially for firms that pay no divi- dends. M/B is predicted to decline over a firm's lifetime due to learning, with steeper decline when the firm is young. These predictions are confirmed em- pirically. Data also support the predictions that younger stocks and stocks that pay no dividends have more volatile returns. Firm profitability has be- come more volatile recently, helping explain the puzzling increase in average idiosyncratic return volatility observed over the past few decades. THE Past TWO Decades Have Witnessed an unprecedented surge in the number of new- ly listed firms on the major U.S. Stock exchanges. According to Fama and French (2001b), over 550 new firms per year appeared between the years 1980 and 2000, on average, compared to less than 150 firms in the previous two decades. Some of these new firms command valuations that might seem too high to be justified by reasonable assumptions about expected future profitability. For example, more than 1 in 10 of all firms listed between the years 1962 and 2000 are worth more than seven times their book value at the end of their year of listing, and almost 1 in 50 firms is worth more than 20 times its book value.

My results are generally consistent with predictions from prospect theory regarding the manner in which stockholders’ unrealized returns moderate their trading response to belief shocks. However, my results also suggest that an emotional component (i.e., regret- avoidance/pride-seeking) is necessary to explain the observed investor behavior.

    "abstract": "Do strategic actions of borrowers and lenders affect corporate debt values? We find higher bond spreads for firms that can renegotiate debt contracts relatively easily. Consistent with theories of strategic debt service, the threat of strategic default de- presses bond values ex ante, even though there may be efficiency gains from renegoti- ation ex post. However, the economic significance of the net effect is small, suggesting that bondholders have considerable bargaining power. The effect of strategic actions is higher when creditors are particularly vulnerable to strategic threats, including risky firms with high managerial shareholding, simple debt structures, and high liquidation costs. This Paper Explores THE Empirical Relationship between corporate debt prices and firm characteristics that influence strategic decisions concerning default and distressed renegotiations. A large body of corporate finance literature doc- uments the effects of firm-specific factors on the outcome of distressed restruc- turing. We investigate whether such factors are reflected ex ante in the prices of nondistressed firms’ bonds. We find that, on average, the possibility of strate- gic default increases corporate debt spreads, even though ex post there may be efficiency gains from renegotiation. The impact of strategic actions on spreads is larger for firms whose creditors are more vulnerable to the threat of strategic default, including low-rated firms with few tangible assets, high manageri",

    "abstract": "This paper analyzes the dynamic portfolio choice implications of strategic interaction among money managers who compete for fund ﬂows. We study such interaction be- tween two risk-averse managers in continuous time, characterizing analytically their unique equilibrium investments. Driven by chasing and contrarian mechanisms when one is well ahead, they gamble in the opposite direction when their performance is close. We also examine multiple and mixed-strategy equilibria. Equilibrium policy of each manager crucially depends on the opponent’s risk attitude. Hence, client in- vestors concerned about how a strategic manager may trade on their behalf should also learn competitors’ characteristics. This Paper Analyzes THE dynamic portfolio strategies of money managers in the presence of strategic interactions arising from each manager’s desire to perform well relative to the other managers. 1 Given the prevalent ﬁnding in money management that the money ﬂows-to-relative performance relationship is increasing, a fund manager has incentives to outperform her peers so as to increase her assets under management and in turn her compensation. 2 A com- mon explanation for this relationship between ﬂows and relative performance is that many client investors choose a fund based primarily on widely pub- lished fund rankings (MorningStar, Forbes, etc.). Money managers may also care about their relative standing for psychological reasons, such as envy or the desire for higher social status. G",

    "title": "Strategic Behavior and Underpricing",
    "abstract": "We contribute to the debate on the optimal design of multiunit auctions by developing and testing robust implications of the leading theory of uniform price auctions on the bid distributions submitted by individual bidders. The theory, which emphasizes market power, has little support in a data set of Finnish Treasury auctions. A reason may be that the Treasury acts strategically by determining supply after observing bids, apparently treating the auctions as a repeated game between itself and primary dealers. Bidder behavior and underpricing react to the volatility of bond returns in a way that suggests bidders adjust for the winner’s curse. Economists AND Policymakers Have Debated the optimal design of multiunit auc- tions for decades. Much of the debate has been shaped by Friedman’s (1960) proposition that the U.S. Treasury could decrease funding costs by using uni- form price rather than discriminatory price auctions. In both auction formats, individual bidders submit collections of bids (demand schedules) and the secu- rities are awarded in the order of descending price until supply is exhausted. In uniform auctions, winning bidders pay the market-clearing (or, stop-out) price of Economics and Business Administration (NHH), and Kristian Rydqvist from Binghamton Uni- versity.

    "title": "Strategic Default and Equity Risk Across",
    "abstract": "We show that the prospect of a debt renegotiation favorable to shareholders reduces the ﬁrm’s equity risk. Equity beta and return volatility are lower in countries where the bankruptcy code favors debt renegotiations and for ﬁrms with more shareholder bargaining power relative to debt holders. These relations weaken as the country’s insolvency procedure favors liquidations over renegotiations. In the limit, when debt contracts cannot be renegotiated, equity risk is independent of shareholders’ incen- tives to default strategically. We argue that these ﬁndings support the hypothesis that the threat of strategic default can reduce the ﬁrm’s equity risk. When A Firm IS IN Financial Distress, its shareholders and debt holders may beneﬁt from a debt renegotiation to avoid an inefﬁcient bankruptcy or liquida- tion. The prospect of a debt reduction through renegotiation may, however, in- duce shareholders to default even if the ﬁrm is solvent (Hart and Moore (1994)). The view that shareholders may default for strategic rather than for solvency reasons has proved useful to understand, among other things, the theoretical determinants of corporate bond spreads (Anderson and Sundaresan (1996)), dividend policies (Fan and Sundaresan (2000)), optimal debt structure (Bergl¨of and von Thadden (1994), Bolton and Scharfstein (1996), Hackbarth, Hennessy, and Leland (2007)), and debt and equity valuation (Garlappi, Shu, and Yan (2006), Davydenko and Strebulaev (2007), Garlappi and Yan (2011)).",

    "title": "Strategic Trading in a Dynamic Noisy Market",
    "abstract": "This paper studies a dynamic model of a financial market with a strategic trader. In each period the strategic trader receives a privately observed endowment in the stock. He trades with competitive market makers to share risk. Noise traders are present in the market. After receiving a stock endowment, the strategic trader is shown to reduce his risk exposure either by selling at a decreasing rate over time or by selling and then buying back some of the shares sold. When the time between trades is small, the strategic trader reveals the information regarding his endowment very quickly. Large Traders , Such AS Dealers , mutual funds, and pension funds, play an important role in financial markets. 1 Many empirical studies show that these agents’ trades have a significant price impact. 2 Recent studies also show that large traders execute their trades slowly, over several days, presumably to reduce their price impact. 3 These studies raise a number of theoretical questions. For instance, what dynamic strategies should large traders em- ploy to minimize their price impact? In particular, how quickly should they execute their trades? How quickly does the price adjust to reflect the pres- ence of a large trader? Given the importance of large traders, an analysis of their dynamic strategies is relevant for understanding the daily and weekly behavior of returns, volume, and bid-ask spreads. It is also relevant for com- paring trading mechanisms, in terms of liquidity provided to larg",

    "abstract": "Using data on auctions of companies, we estimate valuations (maximum willingness to pay) of strategic and ﬁnancial bidders from their bids. We ﬁnd that a typical target is valued higher by strategic bidders. However, 22.4% of targets in our sample are valued higher by ﬁnancial bidders. These are mature, poorly performing companies. We also ﬁnd that (i) valuations of different strategic bidders are more dispersed and (ii) valuations of ﬁnancial bidders are correlated with aggregate economic conditions. Our results suggest that different targets appeal to different types of bidders, rather than that strategic bidders always value targets more because of synergies. THE Market FOR Corporate CONTROLis one of the largest corporate markets. In 2007 alone, the value of M&A transactions worldwide was a staggering $4.8 trillion. While some takeovers proceed as negotiations of a target with a single acquirer, many takeovers face competition among several bidders.1 The set of bidders is composed of two groups: strategic and ﬁnancial. Strategic bidders are usually companies in a related type of business, such as competitors, suppliers, or customers. They tend to look for targets that offer long-term operational synergies and integrate them into their own business. In contrast, ﬁnancial bidders, typically private equity ﬁrms, look for undervalued targets with a potential to generate high cash ﬂow, often after a reorganization. After the acquisition, a ﬁnancial bidder treats the target as a",

    "title": "Stressed, Not Frozen: The Federal Funds Market",
    "abstract": "We examine the importance of liquidity hoarding and counterparty risk in the U.S. Overnight interbank market during the ﬁnancial crisis of 2008. Our ﬁndings suggest that counterparty risk plays a larger role than does liquidity hoarding: the day after Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy, loan terms become more sensitive to borrower char- acteristics. In particular, poorly performing large banks see an increase in spreads of 25 basis points, but are borrowing 1% less, on average. Worse performing banks do not hoard liquidity. While the interbank market does not freeze entirely, it does not seem to expand to meet latent demand. THE Overnight Interbank Market, known as the federal funds market (or fed funds market) in the United States,1 is the most immediate source of liquidity for regulated banks in the United States and thus an important indicator of the functioning of the banking and ﬁnancial system. Problems in the efﬁciency of interbank markets can lead to inadequate allocation of capital and lack of risk sharing between banks. At the extreme, disruptions in interbank markets could even trigger bank runs. In addition, the fed funds market plays a crucial role in the implementation of monetary policy. It is therefore of particular interest to understand whether the interbank market mitigates or ampliﬁes shocks to individual banks or the banking sector as a whole. While we ﬁnd evidence of meaningful disruptions in the U.S. Interbank market after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, we",

    "abstract": "We construct a risk management index (RMI) to measure the strength and inde- pendence of the risk management function at bank holding companies (BHCs). The U.S. BHCs with higher RMI before the onset of the ﬁnancial crisis have lower tail risk, lower nonperforming loans, and better operating and stock return performance during the ﬁnancial crisis years. Over the period 1995 to 2010, BHCs with a higher lagged RMI have lower tail risk and higher return on assets, all else equal. Overall, these results suggest that a strong and independent risk management function can curtail tail risk exposures at banks. THE Failure TO APPRECIATErisk exposures at a ﬁrmwide level can be costly. For example, during the recent episode, the senior managers of some ﬁrms did not fully appreciate the extent of their ﬁrm’s exposure to U.S. Subprime mortgages. They did not realize that, in addition to the subprime mort- gages on their books, they had exposures through the mortgage holdings of off-balance-sheet vehicles, through claims on counterparties exposed to subprime, and through certain complex securities. —Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke1 eree, the Associate Editor, Cam Harvey (Editor), Rajesh Aggarwal, Utpal Bhattacharya, Charles Calomiris (discussant), Mark Carey, Sudheer Chava, Michel Crouhy (discussant), Mark Flannery, Reint Gropp (discussant), Laurent Fresard, Radhakrishnan Gopalan, Nandini Gupta, Iftekhar Hassan, Jean Helwege, Christopher Hennessy, Tullio Jappelli, Steven Kapla",

    "title": "Structural Shifts in Credit Rating Standards",
    "abstract": "I examine the time-series variation in corporate credit rating standards from 1985 to 2007. A divergent pattern exists between investment-grade and speculative-grade rating standards from 1985 to 2002 as investment-grade standards tighten and speculative-grade loosen. In 2002, a structural shift occurs toward more stringent ratings. Holding characteristics constant, ﬁrms experience a drop of 1.5 notches in ratings due to tightened standards from 2002 to 2007. Credit spread tests suggest that the variation in standards is not completely due to changes in the economic climate. Rating standards affect credit spreads. Loose ratings are associated with higher default rates. Credit Rating AGENCIESface widespread criticism regarding the quality of their ratings. The agencies came under ﬁre after the accounting scandals of Enron and WorldCom, but that scrutiny was never as severe as the scrutiny following the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis. During the crisis, mortgage-backed securities, origi- nally rated AAA, were rapidly downgraded or experienced substantial losses, suggesting that these securities had inﬂated ratings. Inﬂuential economists, commentators in the popular press, and hearings in the congressional com- mittees suggest that the rating standards were lax, perhaps due to conﬂicts of interest arising out of revenue models in which rating companies derive fees from the issuers whose securities they rate. 1 The issuer-pays revenue model creates incentives for the rating agencies to ass",

    "abstract": "We study mortgage design features aimed at stabilizing the macroeconomy. We model overlapping generations of borrowers and an inﬁnitely lived risk-averse representa- tive lender. Mortgages are priced using an equilibrium pricing kernel derived from the lender’s endogenous consumption. We consider an adjustable-rate mortgage with an option that during recessions allows borrowers to pay only interest on their loan and extend its maturity. The option stabilizes consumption growth over the business cycle, shifts defaults to expansions, and enhances welfare. The cyclical properties of the contract are attractive to a risk-averse lender so that the mortgage can be pro- vided at a relatively low cost. Events IN THE Last Decade have shown that adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) have advantages over ﬁxed-rate mortgages (FRMs) in stabilizing the economy, at least when the central bank has monetary independence and can lower the short-term interest rate in a recession (Eberly and Krishnamurthy (2014)). A lower short rate provides automatic budget relief for ARM borrow- ers and helps support their spending while reducing the incidence of mortgage default. A lower short rate can also provide some relief to FRM borrowers, but this requires both a decline in the long-term mortgage rate and reﬁnanc- ing, which may be constrained by declining house prices and tightening credit standards. In the aftermath of the Great Recession, mortgage payment rigid- ity and barriers to FRM reﬁnancing were of",

    "abstract": "I ﬁnd that economically meaningless index labels cause stock returns to covary in excess of fundamentals. S&P/Barra follow a simple mechanical procedure to deﬁne their Value and Growth indices. In doing so, they reclassify some stocks from Value to Growth even after their book-to-market ratios have risen, and vice versa. Such stocks begin to covary more with the index they join and less with the index they leave. Backdated constituent data from Barra reveal no such label-related shifts in comovement during the 10 years prior to the actual introduction of the indices in 1992. Investors Must Choose among thousands of ﬁnancial assets when allocating capital. Financial institutions seek to reduce the complexity of this task for investors by labeling assets. Bond ratings, index assignments, industry des- ignations, and other labels group assets with similar characteristics into a relatively small number of categories. Investors can then trade entire asset categories without scrutinizing individual assets. In the terminology that Bar- beris and Shleifer (2003) use, labels deﬁne speciﬁc asset “styles,” and investors who allocate funds across labels rather than individual securities practice a form of “style investing.” The capital ﬂows of such an investor in and out of speciﬁc assets are perfectly correlated across securities with the same label even though the fundamental values of these securities are at most only par- tially related.

    "abstract": "Why do stock prices vary? Using survey forecasts, we ﬁnd that cash ﬂow growth ex- pectations explain most movements in the S&P 500 price-dividend and price-earnings ratios, accounting for at least 93% and 63% of their variation. These expectations co- move strongly with price ratios, even when price ratios do not predict future cash ﬂow growth. In comparison, return expectations have low volatility and small co- movement with price ratios. Short-term, rather than long-term, expectations account for most price ratio variation. We propose an asset pricing model with beliefs about earnings growth reversal that accurately replicates these cash ﬂow growth expecta- tions and dynamics. A Central Question IN Finance IS What drives stock price movements. Speciﬁcally , researchers want to know what explains the large movements in the aggregate price-dividend ratio, a measure of how cheap or expensive stocks are at a given time. Based on the present value approach, for any investor that prices the stock, the stock’s price should equal her expected discounted value of future dividends. This is true whether her expectations match an objective probability distribution or they come from a subjective distribution. Price changes should therefore be due to changes in her dividend expectations or her return expectations, and changes in the price-dividend ratio should be due to changes in her dividend growth expectations or return expectations.

    "abstract": "We offer the ﬁrst empirical evidence on the adverse effect of credit default swap (CDS) coverage on subprime mortgage defaults. Using a large database of privately securitized mortgages, we ﬁnd that higher defaults concentrate in mortgage pools with concurrent CDS coverage, and within these pools the loans originated after or shortly before the start of CDS coverage have an even higher delinquency rate. The results are robust across zip code and origination quarter cohorts. Overall, we show that CDS coverage helped drive higher mortgage defaults during the ﬁnancial crisis. THE Sharp Increase IN Defaults on residential mortgage loans was a driv- ing force behind the 2007 to 2008 ﬁnancial crisis.1 Several recent studies attribute the surge in defaults to looser lending standards associated with the “originate-to-distribute” mortgage loan model—under this model, loans are quickly sold to securitizers, which may reduce lenders’ incentive to carefully screen and monitor borrowers (see, e.g., Mian and Suﬁ (2009), Keys et al.

Posted quotes adjust after the change in fee composition, but the transaction costs for liquidity demanders remain unaffected once fees are taken into account.

    "abstract": "Using proprietary data on stock loan fees and quantities from a large institutional investor, we examine the link between the shorting market and stock prices. Employ- ing a unique identification strategy, we isolate shifts in the supply and demand for shorting. We find that shorting demand is an important predictor of future stock re- turns: An increase in shorting demand leads to negative abnormal returns of 2.98% in the following month. Second, we show that our results are stronger in environments with less public information flow, suggesting that the shorting market is an important mechanism for private information revelation. AN Asset’s Borrowing AND Lending Market can have a large impact on its equilib- rium price. For stocks, an active borrowing and lending market exists,1 but its decentralized format and lack of transparency make isolating a direct link to stock prices difficult. The standard empirical approach to testing the relation between the shorting market and future returns relies on either (1) obtaining data on the direct costs of shorting from the stock loan market, as such costs provide a measure of the constraints on short selling, 2 or (2) employing proxies for shorting demand or shorting supply. The idea behind looking at shorting demand is that some investors may want to short a stock but may be impeded by constraints; if one can measure the size of this group of investors, then one can measure the extent of overpricing or the extent of private informati",

    "abstract": "Previous authors have raised the concern that there could be serious survival bias in the observed U.S. Equity premium. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we argue that the survival bias in the U.S. Data is unlikely to be significant. To reach this conclusion, we introduce a general framework for modeling survival and derive a mathematical relationship between the ex ante survival probability and the aver- age survival bias. This relationship reveals the fundamental difficulty facing the survival argument: High survival bias requires an ex ante probability of market failure, which seems unrealistically high given the history of world financial markets. IN AN Influential Paper, Brown, Goetzmann, and Ross (1995; hereafter BGR) argue that there could be serious survival bias in the observed U.S. Equity premium. This claim, if proven true, would have profound implications given For example, the equity premium is of fundamental importance for asset allocation decisions, estimates of the cost of capital, and the current debate about investing Social Security funds in the stock market. Given the equity premium puzzle first raised by Mehra and Prescott (1985), the equity pre- mium is also important for theoretical asset pricing studies. In this paper, we argue that, contrary to the findings of BGR, the survival bias in the U.S. Equity premium is unlikely to be significant and survival cannot explain the equity premium puzzle.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a portfolio choice model in which investors are subject to liquida- tion risk and (endogenously) face higher costs in the event of joint liquidation (as was observed during the crisis of 2008 to 2009). The risk of joint liquidation creates an incentive for investors to choose heterogeneous portfolios and to rationally forgo di- versiﬁcation beneﬁts. Joint liquidation risk is also reﬂected in asset prices, resulting in (1) assets with high idiosyncratic risk having low expected returns, and (2) as- sets that display high correlation with the portfolios of (liquidation-prone) investors having high expected returns. Investors, Particularly IF They AREleveraged, often have to liquidate following a decline in the value of their portfolios. These liquidations can be very costly when other investors liquidate at the same time and prices are depressed. During the crisis of 2008 to 2009, for example, investors were forced to (jointly) sell securities at ﬁre sale prices after a decline in their value made collateral constraints bind (e.g., at hedge funds), caused withdrawals (again at hedge funds), or triggered margin calls (for margin traders). Similarly, liquidations in the housing market occurred at discounted prices because, during the crisis, a large number of highly mortgaged households became insolvent. Furthermore, during August 2007 in an event largely unrelated to the subprime crisis the joint selling by quantitative hedge funds that had encountered losses",

    "abstract": "Returns on international equities are characterized by jumps; moreover, these jumps tend to occur at the same time across countries leading to systemic risk.W ecapture these stylized facts using a multivariate system of jump-diffusion processes where the arrival of jumps is simultaneous across assets. We then determine an investor’s opti- mal portfolio for this model of returns. Systemic risk has two effects: One, it reduces the gains from diversification and two, it penalizes investors for holding levered posi- tions. We find that the loss resulting from diminished diversification is small, while that from holding very highly levered positions is large. Returns ON International Equities are characterized by jumps;1 moreover, these jumps tend to occur at the same time across countries, implying that conditional correlations between international equity returns tend to be higher in periods of high market volatility or following large downside moves. 2 Our objective in We thank an anonymous referee, Andrew Ang, Pierluigi Balduzzi, Suleyman Basak, Greg Bauer, Geert Bekaert, Harjoat Bhamra, Michael Brandt, John Campbell, George Chacko, Jo ˜ao Cocco, Glen Donaldson, Darrell Duffie, Bernard Dumas, Ken Froot, Francisco Gomes, Eric Jacquier, Tim Johnson, Andrew Karolyi, Andrew Lo, Michelle Lee, Jan Mahrt-Smith, Scott Mayfield, Narayan Naik, Vasant Naik, Roberto Rigobon, Geert Rouwenhorst, Piet Sercu, Milind Shrikhande, Rob Stambaugh, Raghu Sundaram, Luis Viceira, Jiang Wang, Tan Wang",

    "abstract": "We show that the compensation for rare events accounts for a large fraction of the average equity and variance risk premia. Exploiting the special structure of the jump tails and the pricing thereof, we identify and estimate a new Investor Fears index. The index reveals large time-varying compensation for fears of disasters. Our empirical investigations involve new extreme value theory approximations and high-frequency intraday data for estimating the expected jump tails under the statistical probability measure, and short maturity out-of-the-money options and new model-free implied variation measures for estimating the corresponding risk-neutral expectations. So what are policymakers to do? First and foremost, reduce uncertainty. Do so by removing tail risks, and the perception of tail risks. —Olivier Blanchard, chief economist, IMF, The Economist, January 31, 2009.

    "abstract": "Many firms deploy takeover defenses when they go public. IPO managers tend to deploy defenses when their compensation is high, shareholdings are small, and oversight from nonmanagerial shareholders is weak. The presence of a defense is negatively related to subsequent acquisition likelihood, yet has no impact on take- over premiums for firms that are acquired. These results do not support argu- ments that takeover defenses facilitate the eventual sale of IPO firms at high takeover premiums. Rather, they suggest that managers shift the cost of takeover protection onto nonmanagerial shareholders. Thus, agency problems are important even for firms at the IPO stage. The effects of corporate takeover defenses. In this paper, we use information from an unusual natural experiment-the use of takeover defenses by firms as they go public-to examine the motives for and consequences of such defenses. The traditional view is that IPO firms should have-and in fact do have- few if any takeover defenses. For example, Frank Easterbrook and Daniel Fischel (1991, pp. 204-205) argue that \"Firms go public in easy to acquire form: no poison pill securities, no supermajority rules or staggered boards. Defensive measures are added later, a sequence that reveals much.\" This view reflects two assumptions. The first is that takeover defenses lower firm values because they insulate managers from the discipline of the mar- ket for corporate control. The second assumption is that agency conflicts between",

    "title": "Taking a View: Corporate Speculation,",
    "abstract": "Using responses to a well-known confidential survey, we study corporations’ use of derivatives to “take a view” on interest rate and currency movements. Characteristics of speculators suggest that perceived information and cost advantages lead them to take positions actively; that is, they do not speculate to increase risk by “betting the ranch.” Speculating firms encourage managers to speculate through incentive- aligning compensation arrangements and bonding contracts, and they use derivatives- specific internal controls to manage potential abuse. Finally, we examine whether investors reading public corporate disclosures are able to identify firms that indicate speculating in the confidential survey; they are not. Derivative Instruments CAN BE Used TO Hedge market risk exposures or to spec- ulate on movements in the value of the underlying asset. To hedge generally implies that the derivative position is taken with the intention of reducing risk. To speculate generally implies that the derivative position is undertaken with the primary intention of making a profit or increasing risk. Speculation has a pejorative connotation in the financial press, yet it is not clear that this repu- tation is deserved. In this paper, we explore whether speculation is an activity that is optimal ex ante but for which we should expect to observe some large negative outcomes ex post, or whether it is an activity that will decrease ex- pected shareholder value to the benefit of agents of the fi",

    "abstract": "We empirically investigate one form of illegal investor-level tax evasion and its effect on foreign portfolio investment. In particular, we examine a form of round-tripping tax evasion in which U.S. Individuals hide funds in entities located in offshore tax havens and then invest those funds in U.S. Securities markets. Employing Becker’s (1968) economic theory of crime, we identify the tax evasion component by examining how foreign portfolio investment varies with changes in the incentives to evade and the risks of detection. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst empirical evidence of investor- level tax evasion affecting cross-border equity and debt investment. While Taxes Have Played an important part in the ﬁnance literature for decades, the focus to date has been almost exclusively on the implications of the tax laws as legally applied. The effects of tax evasion—the illegal reduction of taxes—on ﬁnancial decisions have gone largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate one form of investor-level tax evasion and its effect on foreign portfolio investment (FPI). Speciﬁcally, we empirically examine a method of offshore tax evasion that we call “round-tripping,” whereby U.S. Individuals hide funds in tax haven entities and then reinvest those funds in U.S. Stocks and bonds.

    "abstract": "The importance of skilled labor and the inalienability of human capital expose ﬁrms to the risk of losing talent at critical times. Using Swedish microdata, we document that ﬁrms lose workers with the highest cognitive and noncognitive skills as they ap- proach bankruptcy. In a quasi-experiment, we conﬁrm that ﬁnancial distress drives these results: following a negative export shock caused by exogenous currency move- ments, talent abandons the ﬁrm, but only if the exporter is highly leveraged.

    "title": "Taming the Factor Zoo: A Test of New Factors",
    "abstract": "We propose a model selection method to systematically evaluate the contribution to asset pricing of any new factor, above and beyond what a high-dimensional set of existing factors explains. Our methodology accounts formodel selection mistakesthat produce a bias due to omitted variables, unlike standard approaches that assume per- fect variable selection. We apply our procedure to a set of factors recently discovered in the literature. While most of these new factors are shown to be redundant relative to the existing factors, a few have statistically signiﬁcant explanatory power beyond the hundreds of factors proposed in the past. THE Search FOR Factors That explain the cross section of expected stock re- turns has produced hundreds of potential candidates, as noted by Cochrane (2011) and more recently by Harvey, Liu, and Zhu (2015), McLean and Pontiff (2016), and Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2017). A fundamental task facing the asset pricing ﬁeld today is to bring more discipline to the proliferation of factors. In particular, a question that remains open is: how to judge whether a new factor adds explanatory power for asset pricing, relative to the hundreds of factors the literature has so far produced? This paper provides a framework for systematically evaluating the contribu- tion of individual factors relative to existing factors as well as for conducting appropriate statistical inference in this high-dimensional setting.

    "title": "Target Behavior and Financing: How Conclusive",
    "abstract": "The notion that firms have a debt ratio target that is a primary determinant of financ- ing behavior is influential in finance. Yet, how definitive is the evidence? We address this issue by generating samples where financing is unrelated to a firm’s current debt ratio or a target. We find that much of the available evidence in favor of target be- havior based on leverage ratio changes can be reproduced for these samples. Taken together, our findings suggest that a number of existing tests of target behavior have no power to reject alternatives. A Traditional View IN Finance IS that firms have debt ratio targets. For example, the notion of the weighted average cost of capital—taught to generations of finance students and recommended as the discount rate in capital budgeting— presupposes the existence of “target capital structure” weights. Tradeoff models that stress various costs and benefits of debt imply the existence of an optimal debt ratio, and it is assumed that firms make financing choices that minimize the cost of deviation from this optimum. In this paper, we evaluate some of the evidence in favor of the view that firms’ financing choices reflect target behavior. We interpret target behavior to mean that a firm’s financing choice at any point in time is a function of its current debt ratio as well as a “target” debt ratio. We find that a bulk of the evidence based on leverage ratio changes can John Graham (the editor), Campbell Harvey (the editor), an anonymous associ",

    "abstract": "We investigate the relation between tax burdens and mutual fund performance from both a theoretical and an empirical perspective. The theoretical model introduces heterogeneous tax clienteles in an environment with decreasing returns to scale and shows that the equilibrium performance of mutual funds depends on the size of the tax clienteles. Our empirical results show that the performance of U.S. Equity mutual funds is related to their tax burdens. We ﬁnd that tax-efﬁcient funds exhibit not only superior after-tax performance, but also superior before-tax performance due to lower trading costs, favorable style exposures, and better selectivity. Investment Taxes Have A Substantial impact on the long-term performance of taxable mutual fund investors. Mutual funds in the United States are re- quired to distribute their dividend income and their realized capital gains to their shareholders. These distributions are taxed at the fund investor level at different rates. In particular, short-term capital gains distributions, generated by the liquidation of fund positions held for less than one year, are typically taxed at substantially higher rates than long-term capital gains distributions. Unrealized capital gains, meanwhile, remain untaxed until the securities are sity.

    "abstract": "We examine ex-dividend date trading of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) using a sample of 1,043 dividends over the period 1988 to 1995. ADR dividends are often subject to foreign withholding taxes, creating incentives for certain investors to avoid the distribution. ADRs exhibit negative abnor- mal ex-dividend day returns, and their prices behave consistently with their related withholding taxes. Abnormal trading volume for taxable issues ex- ceeds 130 percent and 300 percent of normal volume on the cum- and ex-dates, respectively. Abnormal volume is an increasing function of foreign withhold- ing tax rates and decreasing function of transactions costs. This abnormal ex- date trading activity is consistent with tax-motivated trading. This Paper Provides Empirical Evidence from a sample of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) that foreign taxes on dividend income are positively associated with abnormal ex-dividend day trading activity. Researchers have long been interested in the question of whether taxes affect investor behavior around ex-dividend days. Such work has implications for corporate financial and distri- bution policies and for government tax policies. ADRs provide a unique setting in which to examine the effects of taxes on investor trading behavior because of the unique features of the foreign withholding taxes that apply to them.

We provide evidence that this effect can be largely explained by tax-loss selling activities at the previous year-end. Moreover, we find that funds as- sociated with brokerage firms display more tax-loss selling behavior, suggesting that tax counseling plays a role. Among THE Numerous Stock Return Anomalies , probably none has generated more interest than that of the “turn-of-the-year” or “January” effect, the phe- nomenon in which small capitalization stocks realize unusually high returns in early January. 1 The literature offers a number of hypotheses to explain this phenomenon including the tax-loss selling hypothesis, the window dressing hypothesis, the insider trading (information release) hypothesis, and the sea- sonality of the risk–return relation hypothesis.

    "abstract": "We document important interactions between tax incentives and corporate policies using a “quasi natural experiment” provided by a surprise announcement that im- posed corporate taxes on a group of Canadian publicly traded ﬁrms. The announce- ment caused a dramatic decrease in value. Prospective tax shields partially offset the losses, adding 4.6% to ﬁrm value on average, and vary with the tax status of the marginal investor. Further, ﬁrms adjust leverage, payout, cash holdings, and invest- ment in response to changing tax incentives. Overall, the event study and time series evidence supports the view that taxes are important for corporate decision making. HOW DO Corporate Policies interact with tax incentives, and do managers make signiﬁcant changes to corporate policies in response to a change in taxes? While a large literature examines taxes and corporate policies and much progress has been made, Fama (2011 ) argues that the big open challenge in corporate ﬁnance remains to produce evidence on how taxes affect market values and thus optimal ﬁnancing decisions. Stewart Myers injects further skepticism, stating that taxes are of “third order” importance for corporate decision-making (Myers et al. ( 1998)). One reason the empirical challenge remains is that tax effects are difﬁcult to document. Cross-sectional tests face identiﬁcation challenges while tests based on tax policy changes are limited because such changes are rarely signiﬁcant or separable from other changes and ar",

    "title": "Taxes on Tax-Exempt Bonds",
    "abstract": "Implicit tax rates priced in the cross section of municipal bonds are approximately two to three times as high as statutory income tax rates, with implicit tax rates close to 100% using retail trades and above 70% for interdealer trades. These implied tax rates can be identiﬁed because a portion of secondary market municipal bond trades involves income taxes. After valuing the tax payments, market discount bonds, which carry income tax liabilities, trade at yields around 25 basis points higher than com- parable municipal bonds not subject to any taxes. The high sensitivities of municipal bond prices to tax rates can be traced to individual retail traders dominating dealers and other institutions. THE Issue OF HOW Taxes Affect Asset PRICESis an important issue in ﬁnance, accounting, and economics. In theoretical models examining the effect of taxes on different assets and agents (e.g., Auerbach and King (1983), Dybvig and Ross (1986), and Dammon and Green (1987)), taxes induce clientele effects in agents’ asset holdings and the existence of multiple tax rates affects rela- tive asset prices. In reality, however, estimating implicit tax rates on assets is more difﬁcult than theoretical models suggest because of the myriad ways the tax code can be distorted, large investor heterogeneity, and the many degrees of market frictions different investors face. These real-world issues are espe- cially relevant when investigating whether the tax rates faced by individual investors, as op",

I identify the main reason for the observed effect as managerial diversion rather than tax evasion per se. I further show that stricter tax enforcement can improve ﬁrm performance: a one standard deviation increase in tax enforcement corresponds to an increase in the annual revenue growth rate of 2.6%.

The absence of reliable measures of tax evasion is a major impediment to From a theoretical perspective, the effect of tax evasion on ﬁrm value is un- clear.

    "abstract": "We study the asset-pricing implications of technological growth in a model with “small,” disembodied productivity shocks and “large,” infrequent technological in- novations, which are embodied into new capital vintages. The technological-adoption process leads to endogenous cycles in output and asset valuations. This process can help explain stylized asset-valuation patterns around major technological innova- tions. More importantly, it can help provide a uniﬁed, investment-based theory for numerous well-documented facts related to excess-return predictability. To illustrate the distinguishing features of our theory, we highlight novel implications pertaining to the joint time-series properties of consumption and excess returns. Economic Historians Frequently Associate waves of economic activity with the arrival of major technological innovations. The profound changes to manu- facturing during the industrial revolution, the expanding network of railroads in the late 19 th century, electriﬁcation, telephony, television, and the Internet during the course of the last century are only a small number of well-known examples of a general pattern whereby a new technology arrives, slowly gets adopted, and eventually permeates and alters all aspects of production and distribution.

    "abstract": "Can discretely sampled financial data help us decide which continuous-time mod- els are sensible? Diffusion processes are characterized by the continuity of their sample paths. This cannot be verified from the discrete sample path: Even if the underlying path were continuous, data sampled at discrete times will always ap- pear as a succession of jumps. Instead, I rely on the transition density to determine whether the discontinuities observed are the result of the discreteness of sampling, or rather evidence of genuine jump dynamics for the underlying continuous-time process. I then focus on the implications of this approach for option pricing models. IN Many Instances IN Financial Econometrics, we make inference about a pos- tulated continuous-time model on the basis of discretely sampled observa- tions. Among potential continuous-time models, most specifications adopted have been diffusions, although the literature is more and more frequently allowing for jumps (see Merton (1976), Ahn and Thompson (1988), Bates (1991), Das and Foresi (1996), Duffie, Pan, and Singleton (2000), Ait- Sahalia, Wang, and Yared (2001), among others). A diffusion process is a Markov process with continuous sample paths. Suppose we observe the process every A units of time, with A not necessarily small. Presented with such a discrete subsample of the continuous-time path, can we tell whether the underlying model that gave rise to the data was a diffusion, or should jumps be allowed into the model?",

Thus risk compensation cannot vary independently of interest rate volatility. I also describe a broader class of models. These \"essentially affine\" models retain the tractability of standard models, but allow compensation for interest rate risk to vary independently of interest rate volatility. This additional flexibility proves useful in forecasting future yields. CAN WE USE Finance Theory to tell us something about the empirical behavior of Treasury yields that we do not already know? In particular, can we shar- pen our ability to predict future yields? A long-established fact about Trea- sury yields is that the current term structure contains information about future term structures. For example, long-maturity bond yields tend to fall over time when the slope of the yield curve is steeper than usual. These predictive relations are based exclusively on the time-series behavior of yields. To rule out arbitrage, the cross-sectional and time-series characteristics of the term structure are linked in an internally consistent way. In principle, imposing these restrictions should allow us to exploit more of the informa- tion in the current term structure, and thus improve forecasts. But in",

    "abstract": "I relate the downward-sloping term structure of currency carry returns to compensa- tion for currency exposures to macroeconomic risk embedded in the joint dynamics of U.S. Consumption, inﬂation, nominal interest rate, and their stochastic variance. The interest rate and inﬂation shocks play a prominent role. Higher yield currencies ex- hibit higher multiperiod exposures to these shocks. The prices of these risk exposures are positive and sizeable across all investment horizons. The interest rate shock is qualitatively similar to the long-run risk of Bansal and Yaron. IN This Paper,i Quantify THE Risk-return relationship in the foreign exchange (FX) market across different countries and investment horizons. My starting point is new evidence about returns on a currency carry trade, a zero-cost investment strategy that entails buying bonds in high-yield currencies and short-selling bonds in low-yield currencies, across alternative investment hori- zons. The term structure of average carry log returns is slightly downward sloping: the average log returns are 1.13% and 0.80% per quarter at the three- month and 10-year investment horizon, respectively. I ask which sources of macroeconomic risk are compensated in the term structure of carry returns. Shocks to consumption growth, inﬂation, interest rates, and their second- order moments reﬂect different aspects of currency risk. My focus is on iden- tifying such shocks, measuring their impact on exchange rates in the cross ton, the",

    "abstract": "We develop a term structure model where the short interest rate and the market price of risks are subject to discrete regime shifts. Empirical evidence from effi- cient method of moments estimation provides considerable support for the regime shifts model. Standard models, which include affine specifications with up to three factors, are sharply rejected in the data. Our diagnostics show that only the regime shifts model can account for the well-documented violations of the expectations hypothesis, the observed conditional volatility, and the conditional correlation across yields. We find that regimes are intimately related to business cycles. Many Papers Document That THE Univariate short interest rate process can be reasonably well modeled in the time series as a regime switching process (see Hamilton (1988), Garcia and Perron (1996)). In addition to this statis- tical evidence, there are economic reasons as well to believe that regime shifts are important to understanding the behavior of the entire yield curve. For example, business cycle expansion and contraction \"regimes\" potentially have first order effects on inflationary expectations, monetary policy, and nominal interest rates. Such shifts in regimes, on economic grounds, contain the possibility of significant impact not only on the short interest rates but the entire term structure of interest rates. However, standard term struc- ture models, such as the Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1985; CIR) and affine models, do not",

    "abstract": "We show that two important issues in empirical asset pricing—the presence of weak factors and the selection of test assets—are deeply connected. Since weak factors are those to which test assets have limited exposure, an appropriate selection of test as- sets can improve the strength of factors. Building on this insight, we introduce super- vised principal component analysis (spca), a methodology that iterates supervised selection, principal-component estimation, and factor projection. It enables risk pre- mia estimation and factor model diagnosis even when weak factors are present and not all factors are observed. We establish SPCA’s asymptotic properties and showcase its empirical applications. Estimation AND Inference ON Factor models are central elements of em- pirical work in asset pricing. Typically, a researcher starts with a given factor, for example, an aggregate liquidity factor, motivated by economic theory. The objective of the researcher is to estimate and test its risk premium. To proceed, the researcher needs to decide which test assets to use in the estimation. While the literature has proposed a variety of choices for test assets, little work has been dedicated to rigorously and systematically investigating how they should be chosen. Another issue that the researcher faces is the potential presence of weak fac- tors. Broadly speaking, the factor of interest to the researcher is one of many factors that potentially drive returns.

Accounting for unobserved firm heterogeneity using instrumental-variables techniques, we find that entrepreneurial ownership shares increase with outside wealth and decrease with firm risk; effort increases with ownership; and effort in- creases firm performance. The magnitude of the effects in the cross-section of firms suggests that agency costs may help explain why entrepreneurs concentrate large fractions of their wealth in firm equity.

Our natural experiment exploits the staggered implementation of the Elec- tronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (edgar) system, which induces a re- duction in investor disagreement. Consistent with models of investor disagreement, Edgar inclusion helps resolve disagreement around information events, leading to stock price corrections. The reduction in disagreement following Edgar inclusion also reduces stock price crash risk, especially among stocks with binding short-sale constraints and high investor optimism. Disagreement Among Investors is a key ingredient in boundedly ratio- nal and behavioral models of ﬁnancial markets bubbles.

    "title": "The 52-Week High and Momentum Investing",
    "abstract": "When coupled with a stock’s current price, a readily available piece of information—the 52-week high price–explains a large portion of the profits from momentum investing. Nearness to the 52-week high dominates and improves upon the forecasting power of past returns (both individual and industry returns) for future returns. Future returns forecast using the 52-week high do not reverse in the long run. These results indicate that short-term momentum and long-term reversals are largely separate phenomena, which presents a challenge to current theory that models these aspects of security returns as integrated components of the market’s response to news. There IS Substantial Evidence that stock prices do not follow random walks and that returns are predictable. Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) show that stock re- turns exhibit momentum behavior at intermediate horizons. A self-financing strategy that buys the top 10% and sells the bottom 10% of stocks ranked by re- turns during the past 6 months, and holds the positions for 6 months, produces profits of 1% per month. Moskowitz and Grinblatt (1999) argue that momen- tum in individual stock returns is driven by momentum in industry returns. DeBondt and Thaler (1985), Lee and Swaminathan (2000), and Jegadeesh and Titman (2001) document long-term reversals in stock returns.

We develop a tractable framework to study how competition between investors to own socially valuable assets affects social welfare. Relative to the most common social-investing strategies, we identify alternative strategies that result in higher impact and higher ﬁnancial returns. We identify strategies for investors to have impact when impact is difﬁcult to measure. From the ﬁrm’s perspective, increasing proﬁtability can have greater impact than directly increasing social value. We present new empirical evi- dence on the social preferences of investors that demonstrates the practical relevance of our theory . THE Last Decade HAS Seen an invigoration of investing in companies that rank favorably on metrics of social value, such as environmental stewardship, social responsibility , and good governance practices (collectively referred to as ESG). This shift in investment strategies has the potential to alter the alloca- tion of capital in the economy . Indeed, many argue that reallocating resources from socially harmful uses to socially beneﬁcial uses is the point of the ESG in- vesting. It is therefore important to understand whether this style of investing achieves its intended effect, and if so, how .

    "abstract": "Banks’ balance sheet exposure to ﬂuctuations in interest rates strongly forecasts ex- cess Treasury bond returns. This result is consistent with optimal risk management, a banking counterpart to the household Euler equation. In equilibrium, the bond risk premium compensates banks for bearing ﬂuctuations in interest rates. When banks’ exposure to interest rate risk increases, the price of this risk simultaneously rises. We present a collection of empirical observations that support this view, but also discuss several challenges to this interpretation. Banks ARE Large Sophisticated Intermediaries in the market for inter- est rate risk, but are absent from standard studies of the yield curve. 1 In this paper, we show that banks’ balance sheet exposure to ﬂuctuations in interest rates strongly forecasts excess Treasury bond returns. We interpret this result through the lens of banks’ risk management decisions, which tightly connect their exposure to interest rate risk with the price of this risk. This connection represents a banking counterpart to the classic household Euler equation. In equilibrium, an increase in future bond returns compensates any increase in banks’ exposure to interest rate risk. 2 This paper establishes this relationship ∗Valentin Haddad is with Ucla and Nber.

We demonstrate this claim in a two-period market with persistent liquidity trading and risk-averse, privately informed, short-term investors and ﬁnd that prices reﬂect average expectations about fundamentals and liquidity trading. Informed investors engage in “retrospective” learning to reassess inferences (about fundamentals) made during the trading game’s early stages. This behavior introduces strategic complementarities in the use of information and can yield twostable equilib- ria that can be ranked in terms of liquidity, volatility, and informational efﬁciency. We derive implications that explain market anomalies as well as empirical regularities.

    "abstract": "A growing body of evidence suggests that the beneﬁts of international diversiﬁcation via developed markets have declined dramatically. While emerging markets still offer diversiﬁcation opportunities, their public equity indices capture only a fraction of emerging countries’ economic activity. We propose a diversiﬁcation approach that exploits the global connectedness of developed countries to gain exposure to emerging countries’ overall economies rather than their shallow equity markets. In doing so, we demonstrate that developed marketsstill offer substantial diversiﬁcation beneﬁts beyond those available through equity indices. Our results suggest that relying on equity indices to assess diversiﬁcation beneﬁts understates diversiﬁcation gains. International Diversification IS A Fundamental concept in both asset pric- ing and portfolio management. To analyze the potential beneﬁts of investing abroad, researchers often rely on foreign equity market indices where the con- stituent ﬁrms are publicly traded.1 This approach can signiﬁcantly understate potential diversiﬁcation gains because publicly listed ﬁrms account for only a small share of the overall economy in many countries, especially in emerging markets (see Bekaert and Harvey (2014) and Figure1).

    "abstract": "What explains short-term ﬂuctuations of stock prices? This paper exploits a nat- ural experiment from the 18th century in which information ﬂows were regularly interrupted for exogenous reasons. English shares were traded on the Amsterdam exchange and news came in on sailboats that were often delayed because of adverse weather conditions. The paper documents that prices responded strongly to boat ar- rivals, but there was considerable volatility in the absence of news. The evidence suggests that this was largely the result of the revelation of (long-lived) private infor- mation and the (transitory) impact of uninformed liquidity trades on intermediaries’ risk premia. What Drives THE Short-run Volatility of stock returns? Prices move signiﬁ- cantly on a day-to-day basis and it is often unclear why. An extensive literature, going back to Schwert (1981, 1989), Roll (1984a, 1988), French and Roll (1986), and Cutler, Poterba, and Summers (1989), offers two possible explanations: (1) the arrival of public news and (2) the impact of the trading process, which can capture privately informed trading, liquidity trades or shifts in investor sentiment. Distinguishing between these two explanations, however, is not straightfor- ward. Trading and the arrival of news usually go together. Moreover, news arrives continuously to the market and modern textual analysis notwithstand- ing, it is often unclear what information a news item actually contains.

    "abstract": "We examine capital expenditure decisions of discount firms in response to Wal- Mart's entry into their markets. Before Wal-Mart's entry, focused incumbents and discount divisions of diversified incumbents are similar in size, geographic disper- sion, and firm debt levels. However, discount divisions of diversified firms are significantly more productive. After Wal-Mart's entry, diversified firms are quicker to either \"exit\" the discount business or \"stay and fight.\" Also, their capital expen- ditures are more sensitive to the productivity of their discount business. Internal capital markets function well, as transfers are away from the worsening discount divisions. It appears diversified firms make better investment decisions. Recent Work ON Diversified Firms suggests that while internal capital mar- kets are active, they do not appear to facilitate efficient resource allocation. Lamont (1997) reports that in response to a negative shock to their oil di- vision, diversified oil companies cut investment in non-oil divisions. Shin and Stulz (1998) find that while capital investments of small divisions of diversified firms are positively related to cash flows of other divisions, in- vestments seem to be independent of the divisions' own prospects.

We investigate whether access to ﬁnance typically time-varies and, if so, what are the real effects.

Share issuance plays a bigger role than debt issuance in causing these effects. Alternative tests that do not rely onq and cash ﬂow sensitivities suggest that recessions and low sentiment increase external ﬁnance costs, thereby limiting investment and employment.

    "abstract": "I provide evidence that stocks experiencing unusually low trading volume over the week prior to earnings announcements have more unfavorable earnings surprises. This effect is more pronounced among stocks with higher short-selling constraints. These ﬁndings support the view that unusually low trading volume signals negative information, since, under short-selling constraints, informed agents with bad news stay by the sidelines. Changes in visibility or risk-based explanations are insufﬁcient to explain the results. This evidence provides insights into why unusually low trading volume predicts price declines. IN AN Influential Study, Gervais, Kaniel, and Mingelgrin (2001) document that unusually high (low) trading volume, measured over a day or a week, predicts higher (lower) future returns. This phenomenon is known as thehigh explanations for this premium, such as changes in visibility or compensation for risk.1 These explanations, however, mainly relate to the return premium due to unusually high volume—the relation between unusuallylow volume and future returns has received less attention, although it is equally important.2 Our understanding of why unusually low volume predicts future returns therefore remains limited. In this paper, I show that unusually low trading volume signals forthcom- ing negative information about changes in ﬁrm fundamentals, as captured George Bittlingmayer; Ekkehart Boehmer; Bilal Erturk; Egemen Genc; Chao Jiang; Ted Juhl; Ron Kaniel; Sami Keskek;",

    "title": "The Capitalization of Consumer Financing into",
    "abstract": "Using loan-level data on millions of used-car transactions across hundreds of lenders, we study the consumer response to exogenous variation in credit terms. Borrowers offered shorter maturity decrease expenditures enough to offset 60% to 90% of the monthly payment increase. Most of this is driven by shifting toward lower-quality cars, but affected borrowers offset 20% to 30% of a monthly payment shock by negoti- ating lower prices for equivalent cars. Our results suggest that durable goods prices adjust to reﬂect credit terms even at the individual level, with one year of additional loan maturity increasing a car’s price by 2.8%. THE Relationship Between Credit AND asset prices has been an impor- tant area of study in postcrisis ﬁnance. Recent work, which focuses largely on the housing market, has established a causal link running from aggregate credit supply to average prices. However, studies of aggregate credit supply necessarily obscure differences in access to credit in the cross section of bor- rowers. In this paper, we exploit disaggregated data on auto prices and loans to investigate how durable goods markets capitalize credit terms at the indi- vidual borrower level. We document signiﬁcant heterogeneity in transaction prices across borrowers that is driven by differences in borrowers’ access to Ryan Pratt have readThe Journal of Finance’s disclosure policy and have no conﬂicts of interest to disclose.

    "title": "The Case for Intervening in Bankers’ Pay",
    "abstract": "This paper studies the default risk of banks generated by investmentand remunera- tion pressures. Competing banks prefer to pay their banking staff in bonuses and not in ﬁxed wages as risk sharing on the remuneration bill is valuable. Competition for bankers generates a negative externality, driving up market levels of banker remu- neration and hence rival banks’ default risk. Optimal ﬁnancial regulation involves an appropriately structured limit on the proportion of the balance sheet used for bonuses. However, stringent bonus caps are value destroying, default risk enhancing, and suboptimal for regulators who control only a small number of banks. We will not go back to the days of reckless behavior and unchecked excess at the heart of this crisis.

    "abstract": "We model a firm’s demand for liquidity to develop a new test of the effect of financial constraints on corporate policies. The effect of financial constraints is captured by the firm’s propensity to save cash out of cash flows (thecash ﬂow sensitivity of cash). We hypothesize that constrained firms should have a positive cash flow sensitivity of cash, while unconstrained firms’ cash savings should not be systematically related to cash flows. We empirically estimate the cash flow sensitivity of cash using a large sample of manufacturing firms over the 1971 to 2000 period and find robust support for our theory. Constraints on firm behavior and the manner in which firms perform financial management. These two issues, although often studied separately, are funda- mentally linked. As originally proposed by Keynes (1936), a major advantage of a liquid balance sheet is that it allows firms to undertake valuable projects when they arise. However, Keynes also argued that the importance of balance sheet liquidity is influenced by the extent to which firms have access to external capital markets (p. 196). If a firm has unrestricted access to external capital— that is, if a firm is financially unconstrained—there is no need to safeguard against future investment needs and corporate liquidity becomes irrelevant. In contrast, when the firm faces financing frictions, liquidity management may become a key issue for corporate policy. Despite the link between financial constraints and corporat",

    "title": "The Causal Effect of Limits to Arbitrage on Asset",
    "abstract": "We examine the causal effect of limits to arbitrage on 11 well-known asset pricing straints for a quasi-random set of pilot stocks, as a natural experiment. We ﬁnd that the anomalies became weaker on portfolios constructed with pilot stocks during the returns by 72 basis points per month, a difference that survives risk adjustment with standard factor models. The effect comes only from the short legs of the anomaly portfolios. Over THE Last Several Decades , ﬁnance researchers have discovered many cross-sectional asset pricing anomalies, whereby predetermined security characteristics predict future stock returns.1 Such patterns can derive from ei- ther rational risk premia or market mispricing. The mispricing explanation is consistent with the idea that limits to arbitrage delay the ﬂow of wealth from irrational to sophisticated investors (Shleifer and Vishny (1997)). In contrast, if return predictability is the result of rational risk premia that compensate investors for bearing factor risk, limits to arbitrage should not affect expected returns. An interesting question that arises is whether, to the extent that return anomalies reﬂect mispricing, such anomalies are persistent because limits to arbitrage prevent sophisticated investors from trading proﬁtably against helpful comments and suggestions, we thank Wei Xiong (the editor); an anonymous associate ed- itor; two anonymous referees; Karl Diether; Lukasz Pomorski; Jeffrey Pontiff; Lin Sun; and par- Decisions and Asset Ma",

    "abstract": "Disentangling the causal impact of media reporting from the impact of the events being reported is challenging. We solve this problem by comparing the behaviors of investors with access todifferent media coverage of thesame information event. We use zip codes to identify 19 mutually exclusive trading regions corresponding with large U.S. Cities. For all earnings announcements of S&P 500 Index ﬁrms, we ﬁnd that local media coverage strongly predictslocal trading, after controlling for earnings, investor, and newspaper characteristics. Moreover, local trading is strongly related to the timing of local reporting, a particular challenge to nonmedia explanations. A Number OF Recent STUDIESdemonstrate strong correlations between stories reported by the media and stock market reactions.1 This paper addresses the causal relation between the two. Speciﬁcally, we ask whether media coverage of a ﬁnancial event can alter investor behavior. Showing such a causal relation is challenging because media coverage is not random, but rather the product of proﬁt maximization by newspapers, television, magazines, etc. (Gentzkow and Shapiro (2010)). Because a number of unobservable factors that inﬂuence these coverage decisions also affect investor behavior, an identiﬁcation problem arises. For any “news” event, how can we tell whether the media’s coverage changed the market’s response, or whether some unobserved aspect of the event simultaneously drove both media coverage and market reaction?

    "abstract": "We study merger and acquisition (M&A) payment choices of European bidders for publicly and privately held targets in the 1997–2000 period. Europe is an ideal venue for studying the importance of corporate governance in making M&A payment choices, given the large number of closely held firms and the wide range of capital markets, institutional settings, laws, and regulations. The tradeoff between corporate gover- nance concerns and debt financing constraints is found to have a large bearing on the bidder’s payment choice. Consistent with earlier evidence, we find that several deal and target characteristics significantly affect the method of payment choice. Global Merger AND Acquisition (M&A) activity has grown dramatically over the last 10 years, bringing with it major changes in the organization and control of economic activity around the world. Yet there is much about the M&A process that we do not fully understand, including the choice of payment method. Given the large size of many M&A transactions, the financing decision can have a significant impact on an acquirer’s ownership structure, financial leverage, and subsequent financing decisions. The financing decision can also have serious corporate control, risk bearing, tax, and cash flow implications for the buying and selling firms and shareholders. In this study, we examine the choice of payment method and its determinants across a large sample of European M&A transactions. Data has the disadvantage of holding many ins",

    "abstract": "We examine the impact of political, institutional, and economic factors on the choice between selling a state-owned enterprise in the public capital market through a share issue privatization (SIP) and selling it in the private capital market in an asset sale. SIPs are more likely in less developed capital markets, for more profitable state- owned enterprises, and where there are more protections of minority shareholders. Asset sales are more likely when there is less state control of the economy and when the firm is smaller. Our results suggest the importance of privatization activities in developing the equity markets of privatizing countries. IN THE Late 1970S, the Thatcher government of Great Britain coined the term privatization, meaning the sale of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to private investors. Since then, the growth of privatization programs throughout the world has been phenomenal.

    "abstract": "We study the effect of media coverage on corporate governance by focusing on Russia in the period 1999 to 2002. We find that an investment fund’s lobbying increases cov- erage of corporate governance violations in the Anglo-American press. We also find that coverage in the Anglo-American press increases the probability that a corpo- rate governance violation is reversed. This effect is present even when we instrument coverage with an exogenous determinant, the fund’s portfolio composition at the be- ginning of the period. The fund’s strategy seems to work in part by impacting Russian companies’ reputation abroad and in part by forcing regulators into action. IN Recent Years Hedge Funds have emerged as among some of the most powerful players in corporate governance worldwide. From the dismissal of Deutsche Boerse’s CEO Seifert to McDonalds’ spin-off of major assets in an IPO, hedge funds have played a crucial role. TheWall Street Journallabeled them the “new leader” on the “list of bogeymen haunting the corporate boardroom.” 1 Among the many tactics hedge fund managers use, the most prominent is the tactic of focusing public attention on an underperforming company and shaming the CEO to either resign or change policy (Kahan and Rock (2006)). It is hard to tell, however, whether such a public relations campaign is just a smokescreen for more important maneuvers that take place behind the scenes or is a crucial ingredient of their battle.

    "title": "The Corporate Propensity to Save",
    "abstract": "Why do corporations accumulate liquid assets? We show theoretically that intertem- poral trade-offs between interest income taxation and the cost of external finance determine optimal savings. Intriguingly, we find that, controlling for Tobin’s q,s a v - ing and cash flow are negatively related because firms lower cash reserves to invest after receiving positive cash-flow shocks, and vice versa. Consistent with theory, we estimate negative propensities to save out of cash flow. We also find that income uncer- tainty affects saving more than do external finance constraints. Therefore, contrary to previous evidence, saving propensities reflect too many forces to be used to measure external finance constraints. WHY DO Corporations Save ? In other words, why do they funnel their cash flow into liquid asset holdings rather than into physical capital or into shareholder distributions? This question is challenging because such financial decisions cannot be understood in isolation of the real decisions a corporation makes. Not only is the question challenging, but it is also economically interesting in light of the tendency in recent years of both U.S. And European firms to accu- mulate unusually high levels of cash. More generally, savings policies matter for all firms because managers must evaluate the trade-offs between using in- ternal and external funds to finance current and future investment.

    "abstract": "Traditional risk factor models indicate that hedge funds capture pre-fee alphas of 6% to 10% per annum over the period from 1996 to 2012. At the same time, the hedge fund return series is not reliably distinguishable from the returns of mechanical S&P 500 put-writing strategies. We show that the high excess returns to hedge funds and put-writing are consistent with an equilibrium in which a small subset of investors specialize in bearing downside market risks. Required rates of return in such an equilibrium can dramatically exceed those suggested by traditional models, affecting inference about the attractiveness of these investments. Linear Factor Regressions (e.g., Capital Asset Pricing Model (capm), Fama– French three-factor model, Fung–Hsieh nine-factor model, and conditional variations thereof) indicate that hedge funds deliver statistically signiﬁcant alphas (Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1965), Fama and French ( 1993), Agarwal and Naik ( 2004), Fung and Hsieh ( 2004), Hasanhodzic and Lo ( 2007)). Over the period from January 1996 to June 2012, pre-fee alpha estimates for diversiﬁed hedge fund indices range from 6% to 10% per annum, and thus, even after deducting fees, investors appear to earn large abnormal returns relative to commonly used risk models. These estimates indicate a degree of market inef- ﬁciency, that is dramatically different from other areas of investment manage- ment (Fama and French ( 2010)), and suggest that hedge fund returns cannot be replicated by port",

    "abstract": "We extract cost of capital measures for banks using analyst earnings forecasts, which we show are unbiased. We ﬁnd that the cost of equity and the cost of debt decrease in the Tier 1 ratio, whereas total cost of capital is uncorrelated with the Tier 1 ratio. These ﬁndings suggest that investors adjust their return expectations for banks in ac- cordance with the Modigliani–Miller conservation-of-risk principle. Hence, increased capital requirements arenot made socially costly based on a notion that market pric- ing violates risk conservation. Equity can nevertheless still be privately costly for banks because of reduced subsidies. IN THE Debate ON THE Costs and beneﬁts of banking regulation, a key ques- tion of interest is whether loss-absorbing capital in the form of equity is so- cially costly.1 The main theoretical argument for why equity capital is not a costly funding source is the Modigliani-Miller (1958) conservation-of-risk prin- ciple.

    "abstract": "We use exogenous variation in tax beneﬁt functions to estimate ﬁrm-speciﬁc cost of debt functions that are conditional on company characteristics such as collateral, size, and book-to-market. By integrating the area between the beneﬁt and cost functions, we estimate that the equilibrium net beneﬁt of debt is 3.5% of asset value, resulting from an estimated gross beneﬁt (cost) of debt equal to 10.4% (6.9%) of asset value. We ﬁnd that the cost of being overlevered is asymmetrically higher than the cost of being underlevered and that expected default costs constitute only half of the total ex ante costs of debt. Hundreds OF Papers investigate corporate ﬁnancial decisions and the factors that inﬂuence capital structure. Much theoretical work characterizes the choice between debt and equity in a trade-off context in which ﬁrms choose their op- timal debt ratio by balancing the beneﬁts and costs. Traditionally, tax savings due to the deductibility of interest have been modeled as a primary beneﬁt of debt (Kraus and Litzenberger (1973)). Other beneﬁts include committing managers to operate efﬁciently (Jensen (1986)) and engaging lenders to moni- tor the ﬁrm (Jensen and Meckling (1976)). The costs of debt include ﬁnancial distress (Scott (1976)), personal taxes (Miller (1977)), debt overhang (Myers (1977)), and agency conﬂicts between managers and investors or among differ- ent groups of investors.

    "abstract": "We model the distortions that internal power struggles can generate in the allo- cation of resources between divisions of a diversified firm. The model predicts that if divisions are similar in the level of their resources and opportunities, funds will be transferred from divisions with poor opportunities to divisions with good op- portunities. When diversity in resources and opportunities increases, however, re- sources can flow toward the most inefficient division, leading to more inefficient investment and less valuable firms. We test these predictions on a panel of diver- sified U.S. Firms during the period from 1980 to 1993 and find evidence consistent with them. THE Fundamental Question IN THE Theory of the firm, raised by Coase (1937) more than 60 years ago, is how decisions taken inside a hierarchy differ from those taken in the marketplace. Coase suggested that decisions within a hierarchy are determined by power considerations rather than relative prices. If this is indeed the case, why, and when, does the hierarchy domi- nate the market? A major obstacle to progress in this area has been the lack of data. Data on internal decisions made by firms are generally proprietary. Even when they are available to researchers, it is difficult to find a comparable group of decisions taken in the market. A notable exception is the capital allocation decision in diversified firms. Since 1978, public U.S. Companies have been forced to disclose their data on sales, profitability,",

    "abstract": "Standard models of liquidity argue that the higher price for a liquid security reﬂects the future beneﬁts that long investors expect to receive. We show that short-sellers can also pay anet liquidity premium if their cost to borrow the security is higher than the price premium they collect from selling it. We provide a model-free decomposition of the price premium for liquid securities into thenet premiums paid byboth long investors and short-sellers. Empirically, we ﬁnd that short-sellers were responsible for a substantial fraction of the liquidity premium for on-the-run Treasuries from November 1995 through July 2009. Given TWO Securities With similar cash ﬂows, the more liquid security often trades at a higher price than its less liquid counterpart. This price premium is usually thought to reﬂect the future beneﬁts that long investors attribute to securities that can be sold quickly and with little price impact (e.g.,Amihud and Mendelson (1986)). The more liquid security also frequently costs more to borrow, or trades on special, in ﬁnancing markets. Previous literature argues that this ﬁnancing premium is a natural counterpart to the price premium: short-sellers readily pay more to borrow securities that can be sold at a pre- mium (e.g.,Dufﬁe (1996), Krishnamurthy (2002)). However, short-sellers themselves may also value a liquid security over and above the higher sale price they receive.

Bankruptcy costs are very heterogeneous and sensitive to the measurement method used. We find that Chapter 7 liquidations appear to be no faster or cheaper (in terms of direct expense) than Chapter 11 reor- ganizations. However, Chapter 11 seems to preserve assets better, thereby allowing creditors to recover relatively more. Our paper also provides a large number of further empirical regularities.

These cases consist of (1) both publicly traded and privately held corporations, and (2) both Chapter 7 liquidations and Chapter 11 reorganizations. This sample is practically the entire population of unique corporate bankruptcies in these courts. Our paper’s primary objective is to measure how the two available bankruptcy procedures differ, especially but not only in terms of cost. We explore four vari- ables, namely: the change in the estate’s value during bankruptcy (a measure of indirect costs), the time spent in bankruptcy (another and more common measure of indirect costs), the expenses submitted to and approved by the bankruptcy court (a measure of direct costs), and the recovery rates for credi- tors and APR violations.

    "abstract": "The collapse of AAA-rated structured ﬁnance products in 2007 to 2008 has brought renewed attention to conﬂicts of interest in credit rating agencies (CRAs). We model competition among CRAs with three sources of conﬂicts: (1) CRAs conﬂict of under- stating risk to attract business, (2) issuers’ ability to purchase only the most favorable ratings, and (3) the trusting nature of some investor clienteles. These conﬂicts create two distortions. First, competition can reduce efﬁciency, as it facilitates ratings shop- ping. Second, ratings are more likely to be inﬂated during booms and when investors are more trusting. We also discuss efﬁciency-enhancing regulatory interventions.

This potential source of conﬂict has repeatedly been brought to the public’s (and regulators’) attention, particularly following the East Asian Financial Crisis (1997) and in the after- math of the failures of Enron (2001) and Worldcom (2002), but it has never been so salient as during the recent ﬁnancial crisis.

    "title": "The Cross Section of MBS Returns",
    "abstract": "We present a simple, linear asset pricing model of the cross section of Mortgage- Backed Security (MBS) returns. MBS earn risk premia as compensation for their ex- posure to prepayment risk. We measure prepayment risk and estimate risk loadings using prepayment forecasts versus realizations. Estimated loadings on prepayment risk decrease monotonically in securities’ coupons relative to the par coupon, consis- tent with the predicted effect of prepayment on bond value. Prepayment risk appears to be priced by specialized MBS investors. The price of prepayment risk changes sign over time with the sign of a representative MBS investor’s exposure to prepay- ment shocks. THE Market FOR Mortgage -backed Securities (MBS) represents over $7.3 trillion in market value. 1 Accordingly, MBS are a very important part of ﬁxed income portfolios. They constitute about one quarter of the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, a key benchmark for ﬁxed income portfo- lio allocations. Despite the size and importance of the MBS market, relatively little work has been done to systematically explain the cross-section variation in MBS returns. Our study is one of the ﬁrst empirical studies of the returns to MBS over both a long time series and a broad cross section. And, to our knowledge, our paper is the very ﬁrst study of the cross section of MBS re- turns using average monthly returns to measure expected returns, as opposed Asvanunt; Mikhail Chernov; Itamar Drechsler; Mark Garmaise; Ronen I",

    "title": "The Cross-Section of Credit Risk Premia",
    "abstract": "We explore the link between a ﬁrm’s stock returns and credit risk using a simple insight from structural models following Merton (1974): risk premia on equity and credit instruments are related because all claims on assets must earn the same com- pensation per unit of risk. Consistent with theory, we ﬁnd that ﬁrms’ stock returns increase with credit risk premia estimated from CDS spreads. Credit risk premia con- tain information not captured by physical or risk-neutral default probabilities alone. This sheds new light on the “distress puzzle”—the lack of a positive relation between equity returns and default probabilities—reported in previous studies. THE Relation Between Firms’ default risk and equity risk premia is the subject of intense debate in ﬁnance. While some studies conclude that default risk is reﬂected in higher equity risk premia, others identify a “distress puzzle,” showing that high measures of distress risk coincide with anomalously low equity risk premia. These studies use either physical or risk-neutral default probabilities to sort ﬁrms into portfolios with different credit risk. In this paper, we study this question from a new perspective, by focusing on the link between equity and credit markets.

    "title": "The Cross-Section of Managerial Ability,",
    "abstract": "I estimate a dynamic investment model for mutual managers to study the cross- sectional distribution of ability, incentives, and risk preferences. The manager’s com- pensation depends on the size of the fund, which ﬂuctuates due to fund returns and due to fund ﬂows that respond to the fund’s relative performance. The model provides an economic interpretation of time-varying coefﬁcients in performance regressions in terms of the structural parameters. I document that the estimates of fund alphas are precise and virtually unbiased. I ﬁnd substantial heterogeneity in ability, risk preferences, and pay-for-performance sensitivities that relates to observable fund characteristics. THE Mutual Fund Literature largely evolves around two questions: (i) do man- agers have superior investment skills and (ii) do their incentives have an im- pact on the investment risk they take.1 A common way to measure ability and risk taking is to use performance regressions without (explicitly) modeling the manager’s investment problem.

    "title": "The Cross-Section of Volatility",
    "abstract": "We examine the pricing of aggregate volatility risk in the cross-section of stock returns. Consistent with theory, we find that stocks with high sensitivities to innovations in aggregate volatility have low average returns. Stocks with high idiosyncratic volatility relative to the Fama and French (1993, Journal of Financial Economics 25, 2349) model have abysmally low average returns. This phenomenon cannot be explained by exposure to aggregate volatility risk. Size, book-to-market, momentum, and liquidity effects cannot account for either the low average returns earned by stocks with high exposure to systematic volatility risk or for the low average returns of stocks with high idiosyncratic volatility. IT IS Well Known That THE Volatility OF Stock RETURNSvaries over time. While con- of the market and the expected return on the market (see, among others, Camp- bell and Hentschel (1992) and Glosten, Jagannathan, and Runkle (1993)), the question of how aggregate volatility affects the cross-section of expected stock returns has received less attention. Time-varying market volatility induces changes in the investment opportunity set by changing the expectation of fu- ture market returns, or by changing the risk-return trade-off. If the volatility of the market return is a systematic risk factor, the arbitrage pricing theory or a factor model predicts that aggregate volatility should also be priced in the cross-section of stocks.

    "abstract": "Market-wide circuit breakers are trading halts aimed at stabilizing the market dur- ing dramatic price declines. Using an intertemporal equilibrium model, we show that a circuit breaker signiﬁcantly alters market dynamics and affects investor welfare. As the market approaches the circuit breaker, price volatility rises drastically , ac- celerating the chance of triggering the circuit breaker—the so-called “magnet effect,” returns exhibit increasing negative skewness, and trading activity spikes up. Our em- pirical analysis supports the model’s predictions. Circuit breakers can affect overall welfare negatively or positively , depending on the relative signiﬁcance of investors’ trading motives for risk sharing versus irrational speculation. Stock Market Crashes IN THE absence of clear macroeconomic causes raise questions about the extent of conﬁdence in the ﬁnancial market from market participants, policymakers, and the general public alike. While the mechanisms behind these sudden price drops are still not well understood, various measures have been adopted to intervene in the trading process in the hope of stabilizing prices and restoring market order.

    "title": "The Dark Side of Internal Capital Markets:",
    "abstract": "We develop a two-tiered agency model that shows how rent-seeking behavior on the part of division managers can subvert the workings of an internal capital mar- ket. By rent-seeking, division managers can raise their bargaining power and ex- tract greater overall compensation from the CEO. And because the CEO is herself an agent of outside investors, this extra compensation may take the form not of cash wages, but rather of preferential capital budgeting allocations. One interest- ing feature of our model is that it implies a kind of \"socialism\" in internal capital allocation, whereby weaker divisions get subsidized by stronger ones. IN Recent Years, it has become almost axiomatic among researchers in fi- nance and strategy that a policy of corporate diversification is typically value reducing. A variety of empirical evidence lends support to this view. For example, diversified firms apparently trade at lower stock values than com- parable portfolios of specialized firms.1 Moreover, during the 1980s corpo- rate acquirers systematically dismantled diversified firms with the view that the divisions would be more efficiently run as stand-alones.2 While it may be clear to most observers that diversification can destroy value, it is much less clear exactly how it does so. One general theme in the literature is that the conglomerate form of organization somehow exacer- bates the investment inefficiencies that arise from managerial agency prob- tively.

    "abstract": "We investigate the inﬂuence of political and ﬁnancial factors on the decision to priva- tize government-owned ﬁrms. The results show that proﬁtable ﬁrms and ﬁrms with a lower wage bill are likely to be privatized early. We ﬁnd that the government delays privatization in regions where the governing party faces more competition from oppo- sition parties. The results also suggest that political patronage is important as no ﬁrm located in the home state of the minister in charge is ever privatized. Using political variables as an instrument for the privatization decision, we ﬁnd that privatization has a positive impact on ﬁrm performance. THE Sale OF Government -owned Firms to private owners has yielded more than $1 trillion in revenues for governments, improved the performance of government-owned ﬁrms, and facilitated the development of ﬁnancial mar- kets. 1 Yet, governments still own a substantial number of ﬁrms across the world (Megginson (2005)). Given the documented beneﬁts from privatization, why are there widespread delays in the process, with governments worldwide choosing to sell some ﬁrms but not others to private owners? To answer this question, we investigate the role of ﬁrm-speciﬁc ﬁnancial and political factors in the selection of ﬁrms for privatization.

    "title": "The Decline of Secured Debt",
    "abstract": "The share of secured debt issued (as a fraction of total corporate debt) declined steadily in the United States over the twentieth century . This stems partly from ﬁnancial development giving creditors greater conﬁdence that high-quality borrow- ers will respect their claims even if creditors do not obtain security upfront. Conse- quently , such borrowers prefer retaining ﬁnancial ﬂexibility by not giving security up front. Instead, security is given contingently—when a ﬁrm approaches distress. This also explains why , superimposed on the secular decline, the share of secured debt issued is countercyclical. WE Show That THE Issuance OF secured debt by U.S. Corporations declined dramatically over the twentieth century . Almost all debt issued in the early years was backed by collateral. For example, secured bonds accounted for 98.5% of total bond issuance in 1900. By 1943, the share of secured bonds had declined to 66.0%. The use of secured debt continued to decline, and in the 1970s, only half of bonds issued were secured. By the early 2000s, se- cured bond issuances were below 5% of total bonds issued, with highly rated ﬁrms accounting for much of the reduction in the issuance of secured bonds.

    "title": "The Demise of Investment Banking Partnerships:",
    "abstract": "In 1970 the New York Stock Exchange relaxed rules that prohibited the public incor- poration of member firms. Investment banking concerns went public in waves, with Goldman Sachs the last of the bulge bracket banks to float. We explain the pattern of investment bank flotations. We argue that partnerships foster the formation of human capital and we use technological advances that undermine the role of human capital to explain the partnership’s going-public decision. We support our theory using a new data set of investment bank partnership statistics. IN 1970 THE NEW York Stock Exchange (nyse) relaxed its rules to permit joint stock corporate ownership among members. Existing member firms, all of which were constituted as partnerships or as closely held private corporations, did not immediately go public en masse. An initial wave of retail and brokerage firms chose to float in 1970 and 1971; 1 other members waited over a decade, and the last bulge bracket investment bank to float was Goldman Sachs, in 1999. That some firms chose to wait so long to float indicates that for some time after 1970 they found the partnership form preferable to the joint stock form; conversely, the early-movers clearly expected to derive advantages from flotation. In this paper we explain these observations, and we argue that the going-public deci- sion was affected by technological innovations in both information technology and finance.

    "abstract": "We use survey data to measure households’ propensity to default on mortgages even if they can afford to pay them (strategic default) when the value of the mortgage exceeds the value of the house. The willingness to default increases in both the absolute and the relative size of the home-equity shortfall. Our evidence suggests that this willingness is affected by both pecuniary and non-pecuniary factors, such as views about fairness and morality. We also ﬁnd that exposure to other people who strategically defaulted increases the propensity to default strategically because it conveys information about the probability of being sued. IN 2009, FOR THE ﬁrst time since the Great Depression, millions of American households found themselves with a mortgage that exceeded the value of their home. According to First American CoreLogic, more than 15.2 million U.S. Mortgages, or 32.2% of all mortgaged properties, were in a negative equity po- sition as of June 30, 2009, while in some states (such as Arizona and Nevada) this number exceeded 50%. 1 Importantly, the difference between the value of the house and that of the mortgage is often very large. For example, in 2009 the median owner’s equity for those who bought a house in the Salinas, CA metropolitan statistical area (MSA) in 2006 was $214,305. 2 Given the magni- tude of this phenomenon, it is important to investigate whether homeowners with such a large negative equity value will choose to walk away from their version of this paper c",

    "abstract": "Using dealer’s quotes and transactions prices on straight industrial bonds, we in- vestigate the determinants of credit spread changes. Variables that should in theory determine credit spread changes have rather limited explanatory power. Further, the residuals from this regression are highly cross-correlated, and principal com- ponents analysis implies they are mostly driven by a single common factor. Al- though we consider several macroeconomic and financial variables as candidate proxies, we cannot explain this common systematic component. Our results sug- gest that monthly credit spread changes are principally driven by local supply 0 demand shocks that are independent of both credit-risk factors and standard proxies for liquidity. THE Relation Between Stock AND Bond Returns has been widely studied at the aggregate level ~see, e.g., Keim and Stambaugh ~1986!, Fama and French ~1989, 1993!, Campbell and Ammer ~1993!!. Recently, a few studies have investigated that relation at both the individual firm level ~see, e.g., Kwan ~1996!! And portfolio level ~see, e.g., Blume, Keim, and Patel ~1991!, Cornell and Green ~1991!!. These studies focus on corporate bond returns, or yield changes. The main conclusions of these papers are: ~1! High-grade bonds behave like Treasury bonds, and ~2! Low-grade bonds are more sensitive to stock returns. The implications of these studies may be limited in many situations of interest, however. For example, hedge funds often take highly levered pos",

    "abstract": "Seasoned offers were underpriced by an average of 2.2 percent during the 1980s and 1990s, with the discount increasing substantially over time. The in- crease appears to be related to Rule 10b-21 and to economic changes affecting both IPOs and SEOs. Consistent with temporary price pressure, underpricing is positively related to offer size especially for securities with relatively inelas- tic demand. Underpricing is also positively related to price uncertainty and, after Rule 10b-21, to the magnitude of preoffer returns. Additionally, I find that underpricing is significantly related to underwriter pricing conventions such as price rounding and pricing relative to the bid quote. Beginning With Smith (1977), numerous empirical studies have documented signif- icant underpricing for seasoned equity offerings (SEOs) in the United States. Prior studies also point to considerable cross-sectional variation in SEO pricing. For example, Loderer, Sheehan, and Kadlec (1991) report significant differences in underpricing between exchange-listed securities and Nasdaq stocks.While the magnitude of SEO underpricing has been relatively small historically, it in- creased dramatically during the 1990s. SEO underpricing averaged 1.15 percent for offers from 1980 to 1989, increased to 2.92 percent for offers from 1990 to 1998, and reached as high as 3.72 percent in 1996.

    "abstract": "For NYSE-listed IPOs, limit order submissions and depth relative to volume are un- usually low on the first trading day. Initial buy-side liquidity is higher for IPOs with high-quality underwriters, large syndicates, low insider sales, and high premarket demand, while sell-side liquidity is higher for IPOs that represent a large fraction of outstanding shares and have low premarket demand. Our results suggest that un- certainty and offer design affect initial liquidity, though order flow stabilizes quickly. We also find that submission strategies are influenced by expected underwriter stabi- lization and preopening order flow contains information about both initial prices and subsequent returns. A Liquid Secondary Market is a critical component in a successful initial public offering (IPO). For investors, a liquid market can reduce transaction costs and lower volatility in the immediate aftermarket. Initial liquidity may also reduce the costs faced by market makers who act as the trader of last resort. Finally, a liquid market may reduce required underpricing and can improve the issuing firm’s future access to capital markets by attracting analysts or investors.

    "abstract": "The abnormal return associated with a stock being added to the S&P 500 has fallen from an average of 7.4% in the 1990s to less than 1% over the past decade. This has occurred despite a signiﬁcant increase in the share of stock market assets linked to the index. A similar pattern has occurred for index deletions, with large negative abnormal returns during the 1990s but an average return of only 0.1% between 2010 and 2020. We investigate the drivers of this phenomenon and discuss implications for market efﬁciency . We document a similar decline in the index effect among other families of indices. ONE OF THE Early ANDpersuasive challenges to the efﬁcient markets hypoth- esis was the observation that stock prices react to investor demand unrelated to fundamentals. In particular, Shleifer (1986) and Harris and Gurel (1986) showed that stocks added to the S&P 500 index experienced abnormal returns of approximately 3% around the announcement of an index change. Since these studies, an extensive literature has documented similar price impact in other stock indices such as the Russell and the Msci, as well as many other settings in which investors buy or sell for reasons unrelated to fundamentals, includ- ing mutual fund inﬂows, mechanical reinvestment of dividends, price pressure around mergers, and Treasury auctions.1 The initial studies of S&P 500 changes were performed during a time when index investing was nascent.

    "abstract": "This paper tests whether the “disposition effect,” that is the tendency of investors to ride losses and realize gains, induces “underreaction” to news, leading to return predictability. I use data on mutual fund holdings to construct a new measure of reference purchasing prices for individual stocks, and I show that post-announcement price drift is most severe whenever capital gains and the news event have the same sign. The magnitude of the drift depends on the capital gains (losses) experienced by the stock holders on the event date. An event-driven strategy based on this effect yields monthly alphas of over 200 basis points. IN Recent Years , Mounting Evidence Challenges the traditional view that securities are rationally priced to reflect publicly available information. Specif- ically, an extensive body of empirical literature reports that stock prices appear to drift after major corporate news announcements. While positive news is generally met with price appreciation, prices subsequent to the announce- ment often show positive abnormal drift; similarly, negative news generates negative market reaction around the event date, but often tends to be followed by a negative drift. As a result, some event-driven equity strategies based on market impact appear to earn significant returns in the subsequent weeks or even months. Sions, encouragement, and for insightful comments.

    "abstract": "Diversified firms have different values from comparable portfolios of single- segment firms. These value differences must be due to differences in either future cash flows or future returns. Expected security returns on diversified firms vary systematically with relative value. Discount firms have significantly higher sub- sequent returns than premium firms. Slightly more than half of the cross-sectional variation in excess values is due to variation in expected future cash flows, with the remainder due to variation in expected future returns and to covariation be- tween cash flows and returns. THE Value OF ANY Asset Depends mechanically on the asset's future cash flows and future returns. This fact is, by definition, true both for actual future cash flows and returns and for expected future cash flows and returns. High future cash flows imply high value today, and high future returns imply low value today. Thus, to explain the value of an asset, one needs to examine expected future cash flows and expected future returns. In recent years, the average diversified firm has been worth less than a portfolio of comparable single-segment firms (Lang and Stulz (1994), Berger and Ofek (1995)). A large literature attempts to explain this fact by explor- ing ways that diversification might affect cash flows. This literature hypoth- esizes that diversification itself causes the diversified firm to generate different cash flows than it would if separated into single-segment firms. Potent",

    "title": "The Dividend Disconnect",
    "abstract": "Many individual investors, mutual funds, and institutions trade as if dividends and capital gains are disconnected attributes, not fully appreciating that dividends re- sult in price decreases. Behavioral trading patterns (e.g., the disposition effect) are driven by price changes instead of total returns. Investors rarely reinvest dividends, and trade as if dividends are a separate, stable income stream. Analysts fail to ac- count for the effect of dividends on price, leading to optimistic price forecasts for dividend-paying stocks. Demand for dividends is systematically higher in periods of low interest rates and poor market performance, leading to lower returns for dividend- paying stocks. The humble dividend is reclaiming its rightful place as the arbiter of stock-market value . . . To investors desperate for income, the argument for buying equities is, well, duh. Who wouldn’t want a higher income? Shares might swing around, but corporate managers go out of their way to preserve the dividend.

    "title": "The Dog That Did Not Bark: Insider Trading",
    "abstract": "This paper documents that at the individual stock level, insiders’ sales peak many months before a large drop in the stock price, while insiders’ purchases peak only the month before a large jump. We provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon based on trading constraints and asymmetric information. A key feature of our theory is that rational uninformed investors may react more strongly to the absence of insider sales than to their presence (the “dog that did not bark” effect). We test our hypothesis against competing stories, such as insiders timing their trades to evade prosecution. SIR Arthur Conan Doyle Made Clear in his celebrated “Silver Blaze” mystery that sometimes there is more to be learned from the absence of an action than from its presence. This insight turns out to be very relevant in the present, and first, study of the patterns of insider trading preceding large movements in stock prices. While our entire analysis is conducted at the individual stock level, it is convenient to illustrate the type of phenomena we study by means of a figure based on aggregate data. Figure 1 shows corporate managers’ sales and purchases in the 12 months preceding, respectively, the largest drop and the largest jump in the monthly S&P 500 index during the 1986 to 2005 period. 1 It can be observed that aggregate sales by insiders peak 10 months before the drop and then decline sharply before the drop occurs. By way of contrast, aggregate purchases by insiders before the",

    "title": "The Downside of Asset Screening for Market",
    "abstract": "This paper explores the tension between asset quality and market liquidity. I model an originator who screens assets whose cash ﬂows are later sold in secondary markets. Screening improves asset quality but gives rise to asymmetric information, hindering trade of the asset cash ﬂows. In the optimal mechanism (second-best), costly retention of cash ﬂows is essential to implement asset screening. Market allocations can feature too much or too little screening relative to second-best, where too much screening gen- erates inefﬁciently illiquid markets. Furthermore, the economy is prone to multiple equilibria. The optimal mechanism is decentralized with two tools: retention rules and transfers. Secondary Markets FOR Assets Play an important role in providing lending capacity to the ﬁnancial industry and the real economy, by allowing ﬁnan- cial institutions to raise funds through asset sales. In 2007 more than 25% of outstanding consumer credit in the United States was ﬁnanced through the securitization of consumer loans.1 Following the ﬁnancial crash of 2008, how- ever, issuance of securitized assets collapsed, adversely affecting ﬁnancial in- stitutions and, in turn, ﬁrms and consumers’ access to credit (Chodorow-Reich (2014), Mondragon (2015)).

    "title": "The Dynamics of Financially Constrained",
    "abstract": "We develop a model in which ﬁnancially constrained arbitrageurs exploit price dis- crepancies across segmented markets. We show that the dynamics of arbitrage cap- ital are self-correcting: following a shock that depletes capital, returns increase, which allows capital to be gradually replenished. Spreads increase more for trades with volatile fundamentals or more time to convergence. Arbitrageurs cut their po- sitions more in those trades, except when volatility concerns the hedgeable com- ponent. Financial constraints yield a positive cross-sectional relationship between spreads/returns and betas with respect to arbitrage capital. Diversiﬁcation of arbi- trageurs across markets induces contagion, but generally lowers arbitrageurs’ risk and price volatility. THE Assumption OF Frictionless ARBITRAGEis central to ﬁnance theory and all of its practical applications. It is hard to reconcile, however, with the large body of evidence on so-called market anomalies, in particular those concerning price discrepancies between assets with almost identical payoffs. Such discrepan- cies arise during both crises and more tranquil times.

    "abstract": "We study the daily and intradaily cross-sectional relation between stock re- turns and the trading of institutional and individual investors in Nasdaq 100 securities. Based on the previous day's stock return, the top performing decile of securities is 23.9% more likely to be bought in net by institutions (and sold by individuals) than those in the bottom performance decile. Strong contem- poraneous daily patterns can largely be explained by net institutional (indivi- dual) trading positively (negatively) following past intradaily excess stock returns (or the news associated therein). In comparison, evidence of return predictability and price pressure are economically small. Recent studies examining the relation between institutional ownership and stock returns document three main findings. First, institutions are momentum investors and tend to follow past prices (Grinblatt, Titman, and Wermers (1995)).1 Second, mutual funds sometimes tend to move together or engage in herding (Wermers (1999)).2 Third, the contemporaneous relation between changes in institutional ownership and stock returns is much stronger than the trend chasing effect (Nofsinger and Sias (1999) and Wermers (1999)).

    "abstract": "We analyze the effects of regulatory interference in compensation contracts, focus- ing on recent mandatory deferral and clawback requirements restricting incentive compensation of material risk-takers in the ﬁnancial sector. Moderate deferral re- quirements have a robustly positive effect on risk-management effort only if the bank manager’s outside option is sufﬁciently high; otherwise, their effectiveness depends on the dynamics of information arrival.

    "abstract": "This paper examines how market frictions inﬂuence the managerial incentives and organizational structure of new hedge funds. We develop a stylized model in which new managers search for accredited investors and have stronger incentives to acquire managerial skill when encountering low investor demand. Fund families endogenously arise to mitigate frictions and weaken the performance incentives of afﬁliated new funds. Empirically , based on a TASS-HFR-BarclayHedge merged database, we ﬁnd that ex ante identiﬁed cold inceptions facing low investor demand outperform existing hedge funds and hot inceptions facing high demand and that cold stand-alone inceptions outperform all types of family-afﬁliated inceptions. THE Hedge Fund Industry HAS Experienced dramatic growth over the last few decades. For example, worth less than $100 billion prior to the 1990s, it ballooned to $3 trillion in assets under management (AUM) by 2019. Although capital ﬂows to both existing and new funds are important in explaining the rapid growth of the hedge fund industry , the literature has focused primarily on the former. The pioneering work of Aggarwal and Jorion (2010) on hedge fund inceptions presents evidence of outperformance during the ﬁrst two or three years of existence.

    "abstract": "We study 154 domestic mergers in Japan during 1977 to 1993. In contrast to U.S. Evidence, mergers are viewed favorably by investors of acquiring firms. We docu- ment a two-day acquirer abnormal return of 1.2 percent and a mean cumulative abnormal return of 5.4 percent for the duration of the takeover. Announcement returns display a strong positive association with the strength of acquirer's rela- tionships with banks. The benefits of bank relations appear to be greater for firms with poor investment opportunities and when the banking sector is healthy. We conclude that close ties with informed creditors, such as banks, facilitate invest- ment policies that enhance shareholder wealth. IN Perfect Capital Markets, investment choices are independent of financing choices. In the presence of capital market imperfections, however, financing alternatives can have an important influence on firms' investment policies. A vast literature in this area emphasizes the importance of informational asymmetries and the costs of financial distress and agency conflicts. In the presence of such market imperfections, leverage can create incentives to de- viate from the optimal investment policy. The asset-substitution problem (Jensen and Meckling (1976)), the underinvestment problem (Myers (1977)), and the overinvestment problem (Stulz (1990)) are well-known examples of such distortions of investment policy.

    "title": "The Effect of Banking Relationships",
    "abstract": "This paper investigates the effects of pre-IPO banking relationships on a firm’s IPO. Using a new and unique data set, which compares the firm’s pre-IPO banking relationships to the underwriters managing the firm’s new issue, I test whether bank- ing relationships established before the firm’s IPO ameliorate asymmetric informa- tion problems behind high IPO underpricing. The results show that firms with a pre-IPO banking relationship with a prospective underwriter face about 17% lower underpricing than firms without such banking relationships. These results are robust to controlling for the firm’s endogenous selection of the pre-IPO banking institution. This Paper Investigates whether having an established relationship with a bank that can manage IPOs, prior to a firm’s IPO, affects the firm’s IPO under- pricing. When firms go public, the market and the firm are asymmetrically informed about the true value of the firm. Many theorists claim that this asymmetric information problem is to blame for the underpricing of IPOs. A different strand of the finance literature examines the implications of lend- ing relationships: When a bank lends to a firm, it obtains proprietary, firm- specific information that cannot be easily and credibly conveyed to others.

    "title": "The Effect of Housing on Portfolio Choice",
    "abstract": "We show that characterizing the effects of housing on portfolios requires distinguish- ing between the effects of home equity and mortgage debt. We isolate exogenous variation in home equity and mortgages by using differences across housing markets in house prices and housing supply elasticities as instruments. Increases in property value (holding home equity constant) reduce stockholdings, while increases in home equity wealth (holding property value constant) raise stockholdings. The stock share of liquid wealth would rise by 1 percentage point—6% of the mean stock share—if a household were to spend 10% less on its house, holding ﬁxed wealth. Houses ARE THE Largest Assets Owned by most households, but the impact of housing on ﬁnancial markets remains unclear. Many models predict that housing tends to reduce the demand for risky assets because it increases a household’s exposure to risk and illiquidity (Grossman and Laroque ( 1990), Brueckner (1997), Fratantoni ( 2001), Flavin and Yamashita ( 2002), Chetty and Szeidl ( 2007)). But empirical studies have not found a systematic relationship between housing and portfolios in practice (Fratantoni ( 1998), Heaton and Lucas (2000), Yamashita ( 2003), Cocco ( 2005)).

We ﬁrst show, using a simple model, that it is critical to separate the effects of property value from the ef- fects of home equity to characterize the effects of housing on portfolios.

    "title": "The Effect of SOX Section 404: Costs, Earnings",
    "abstract": "This paper exploits a natural quasi-experiment to isolate the effects that were uniquely due to the Sarbanes–Oxley Act (SOX): U.S. ﬁrms with a public ﬂoat under $75 million could delay Section 404 compliance, and foreign ﬁrms under $700 million could delay the auditor’s attestation requirement. As designed, Section 404 led to conservative reported earnings, but also imposed real costs. On net, SOX compliance reduced the market value of small ﬁrms. THE Sarbanes–oxley ACT (SOX) was passed in 2002 after a string of high proﬁle corporate scandals. The law’s main goal was to improve the quality of ﬁnancial reporting and to increase investor conﬁdence. The Securities and Ex- change Commission (SEC) was put in charge of enforcing the law. In 2003, the SEC implemented Section 404 of SOX, which requires companies to put in place and periodically test procedures that monitor the internal systems en- suring accurate ﬁnancial reports. 1 Section 404 requires that managers report their ﬁndings in a special management’s report, and that an outside auditor attest to management’s assessment of the company controls. According to the SEC, Section 404 procedures are intended to help companies detect fraudu- lent reporting early and thus to deter ﬁnancial fraud, directly improving the reliability of ﬁnancial statements (SEC release 33-8238). Recently, Section 404 and its practical application have come under intense attack from business groups and lawmakers alike. In 2005, the Duke Univer- sity/C",

    "title": "The Effect of Short Selling on Bubbles",
    "abstract": "A series of experiments illustrate that relaxing short-selling constraints lowers prices in experimental asset markets, but does not induce prices to track fundamentals. We argue that prices in experimental asset markets are influenced by restrictions on short-selling capacity and limits on the cash available for purchases. Restrictions on short sales in the form of cash reserve requirements and quantity limits on short positions behave in a similar manner. A simulation model, based on DeLong et al. (1990), generates average price patterns that are similar to the observed data. Asset Market Bubbles ARE Persistent Deviations of prices from fundamentals. To the extent that bubbles exist, they can influence investment levels and the allo- cation of capital, and thereby have considerable economic effects. In recognition of their potential importance, the question of the existence and pervasiveness of bubbles has been a focus of extensive empirical investigation (see, e.g., Shiller (1981), Blanchard and Watson (1982), Diba and Grossman (1988), and West (1988)). These studies yield mixed results regarding the empirical relevance of bubble phenomena. One source of the differences in conclusions may be that, because the fundamental value of the assets cannot be observed, tests of the presence of bubbles are joint tests, with the particular specification of the pro- cess guiding the evolution of fundamentals also being tested.

    "title": "The Effect of Succession Taxes on Family Firm",
    "abstract": "This paper provides causal evidence on the impact of succession taxes on ﬁrm in- vestment decisions and transfer of control. Using a 2002 policy change in Greece that substantially reduced the tax on intrafamily transfers of businesses, I show that succession taxes lead to a more than 40% decline in investment around family succes- sions, slow sales growth, and a depletion of cash reserves. Furthermore, succession taxes strongly affect the decision to sell or retain the ﬁrm within the family. I conclude by discussing implications of my ﬁndings for ﬁrms in the United States and Europe. Demographic Trends IN both the United States and Europe make ﬁrm suc- cession planning increasingly important for privately held family businesses.1 Each year, an estimated 690,000 ﬁrms providing 2.8 million jobs change hands in the (European union/EU; European Commission (2006)). Succession taxes, which are incurred during such transfers and are some- one hand, there are concerns that taxing successions can discourage ﬁrm in- vestment and growth, and may even force entrepreneurs to sell their ﬁrms in order to meet their tax liability. On the other hand, abundant empirical evidence suggests that inherited ﬁrms underperform (Perez-Gonzalez (2006), Villalonga and Amit (2006), Bennedsen et al. (2007)), which implies that suc- cession taxes might be too low, that is, provide incentives to keep poorly man- aged ﬁrms within the family (Bloom (2006)).

    "title": "The Effects of Banking Mergers",
    "abstract": "This paper studies the effects of banking mergers on individual business borrow- ers. Using information on individual loan contracts between banks and companies, I analyze the effect of banking consolidation on banks' credit policies. I find that in-market mergers benefit borrowers if these mergers involve the acquisition of banks with small market shares. Interest rates charged by the consolidated banks decrease, but as the local market share of the acquired bank increases, the effi- ciency effect is offset by market power. Mergers have different distributional ef- fects across borrowers. When banks become larger, they reduce the supply of loans to small borrowers. There HAS Been Significant worldwide banking consolidation in recent years. Berger et al. (1998) show that between 1979 and 1994 in the United States, there were about 3,600 mergers in which two or more banks combined into a single charter. Over the same period, the fraction of gross total assets held by small banks decreased dramatically. In 1996, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) reported a similar trend in Japan and across Europe, es- pecially during the 1990s. These changes raise many policy concerns. Since banks are an important source of capital, changes in the market structure of banking can seriously affect a wide range of nonbanking industries. Empirical studies emphasize two facts that are key to assessing the con- sequences of this consolidation process. First, there is a positive relationshi",

    "title": "The Effects of Stock Lending on Security Prices:",
    "abstract": "We examine the impact of short selling by conducting a randomized stock lending ex- periment. Working with a large, anonymous money manager, we create an exogenous and sizeable shock to the supply of lendable shares by taking high loan fee stocks in the manager’s portfolio and randomly making available and withholding stocks from the lending market. The experiment ran in two independent phases: the ﬁrst, from September 5 to 18, 2008, with over $580 million of securities lent, and the second, from June 5 to September 30, 2009, with over $250 million of securities lent. While the supply shocks signiﬁcantly reduce market lending fees and raise quantities, we ﬁnd no evidence that returns, volatility, skewness, or bid–ask spreads are affected. The results provide novel evidence on the impact of shorting supply and do not indicate any adverse effects on stock prices from securities lending. THE Impact OF Short selling is the subject of ongoing debate among academics, investment committees, corporate boards, and regulators. One view is that short selling helps make markets more efﬁcient by improving price discovery. An alternative view is that short selling distorts markets and adversely affects prices by moving them further away from fundamentals. Indeed, short-sellers have often been characterized as immoral, unethical, and unpatriotic.1 Interest in the effects of short selling has intensiﬁed with the sharp drop in asset prices, particularly those of ﬁnancial institutions during t",

    "abstract": "We study the properties of unconditional minimum-variance portfolios in the pres- ence of conditioning information. Such portfolios attain the smallest variance for a given mean among all possible portfolios formed using the conditioning informa- tion. We provide explicit solutions for n risky assets, either with or without a riskless asset. Our solutions provide insights into portfolio management problems and issues in conditional asset pricing. Since THE Pivotal Work of Markowitz (1959) and Sharpe (1964), mean vari- ance analysis has been a central focus of financial economics. Mean variance theory is used in portfolio analysis, asset pricing, investment performance measurement, and topics in corporate finance. Mean variance analysis also has other important economic applications. Problems involving quadratic objective functions or loss functions generally incorporate a mean variance analysis. Examples include economic policy under uncertainty, labor mar- kets, monetary policy, inventory problems, hedging, resource economics, and a host of other applications. This paper provides solutions to mean variance optimization problems in the presence of conditioning information. Conditioning information is present when the optimal solution may be a function of information to be received about the probability distribution of future outcomes. For example, empiri- Washington.

    "title": "The Employment Effects of Faster Payment:",
    "abstract": "We study the impact of Quickpay, a reform that permanently accelerated payments to small business contractors of the U.S. Government. We ﬁnd a strong direct effect of the reform on employment growth at the ﬁrm level. However, we document sub- stantial crowding out of nontreated ﬁrms’ employment within local labor markets. While the overall net employment effect is positive, it is close to zero in tight labor markets. Our results highlight an important channel for alleviating ﬁnancing con- straints in small ﬁrms, but emphasize the general-equilibrium effects of large-scale interventions, which can lead to lower aggregate outcomes depending on labor mar- ket conditions. Following THE 2008 Financial Crisis and subsequent slow recovery, the contraction in credit supplied by ﬁnancial intermediaries to nonﬁnancial ﬁrms had a substantial impact on the real economy, particularly so on smaller ﬁrms (Ivashina and Scharfstein ( 2010), Iyer et al. ( 2014), Paravisini et al. ( 2015)). Policy makers interested in stimulating aggregate employment have thus fo- cused on increasing small ﬁrms’ access to bank credit to alleviate ﬁnancing constraints (Bernanke ( 2010), Yellen ( 2013), Mills and McCarthy ( 2014)). Beyond facilitating access to bank credit, however, government can impact small ﬁrms’ ﬁnancing more directly through its role as their customer. In the mous referees for helpful comments.

    "title": "The Entrepreneur’s Choice between Private",
    "abstract": "We analyze an entrepreneur/manager’s choice between private and public ownership. The manager needs decision-making autonomy to optimally manage the firm and thus trades off an endogenized control preference against the higher cost of capital accompanying greater managerial autonomy. Investors need liquid ownership stakes. Public capital markets provide liquidity, but stipulate corporate governance that im- poses generic exogenous controls, so the manager may not attain the desired trade-off between autonomy and the cost of capital. In contrast, private ownership provides the desired trade-off through precisely calibrated contracting, but creates illiquid owner- ship. Exploring this tension generates new predictions. The battle for Safeway raises an old but important question: is it better to be a private company than to be a public one? The Economist, January 25th 2003, p. 57 Should a firm be publicly or privately owned? Public ownership involves pub- licly traded shares and public corporate governance, with diffused ownership and control. Private ownership operates without a market listing and involves private contracting, typically with concentrated ownership and control. That is, private and public ownership differ along two dimensions namely, investor liquidity and the allocation of control between managers and investors, which is determined through corporate governance. While it is well known that liq- uidity considerations affect the type of ownership chosen, there is",

    "abstract": "I model positive sorting of entrepreneurs across the high and low value-added seg- ments of the venture capital market. Aiming to attract high-quality entrepreneurs, inefﬁciently many venture capitalists (VCs) commit to provide high value-added by forming small portfolios. This draws the marginal entrepreneur away from the low value-added segment, reducing match quality in the high value-added segment too. There is underinvestment. Multiple equilibria may emerge, and they differ in ag- gregate investment. The model rationalizes evidence on VC returns and value-added along fundraising “waves” and when the cost of entrepreneurship falls, and generates untested predictions on the size and value-added of venture capital. Venture Capitalists (VCS) ADD Value TO the companies they ﬁnance (Hellmann and Puri (2002), Gompers et al. (2020)).1 How much they can do so is determined largely by the resources, such as human capital, that they choose to employ and devote to each ﬁrm in their portfolio (Ewens and Rhodes- Kropf (2015)). As these resources are scarce, there is a trade-off between the number of ﬁrms in a VC’s portfolio and the value-added each ﬁrm will receive.

    "title": "The Equity Premium",
    "abstract": "We estimate the equity premium using dividend and earnings growth rates to measure the expected rate of capital gain. Our estimates for 1951 to 2000, 2.55 percent and 4.32 percent, are much lower than the equity premium produced by the average stock return, 7.43 percent. Our evidence suggests that the high aver- age return for 1951 to 2000 is due to a decline in discount rates that produces a large unexpected capital gain. Our main conclusion is that the average stock re- turn of the last half-century is a lot higher than expected. THE Equity PREMIUM-the difference between the expected return on the mar- ket portfolio of common stocks and the risk-free interest rate-is important in portfolio allocation decisions, estimates of the cost of capital, the debate about the advantages of investing Social Security funds in stocks, and many other applications. The average return on a broad portfolio of stocks is typ- ically used to estimate the expected market return. The average real return for 1872 to 2000 on the S&P index (a common proxy for the market portfolio, also used here) is 8.81 percent per year. The average real return on six- month commercial paper (a proxy for the risk-free interest rate) is 3.24 per- cent. This large spread (5.57 percent) between the average stock return and the interest rate is the source of the so-called equity premium puzzle: Stock returns seem too high given the observed volatility of consumption (Mehra and Prescott (1985)).

    "title": "The Equity Premium and Structural Breaks",
    "abstract": "A long return history is useful in estimating the current equity premium even if the historical distribution has experienced structural breaks. The long series helps not only if the timing of breaks is uncertain but also if one believes that large shifts in the premium are unlikely or that the premium is associated, in part, with volatility. Our framework incorporates these features along with a belief that prices are likely to move opposite to contemporaneous shifts in the premium. The esti- mated premium since 1834 fluctuates between 4 and 6 percent and exhibits its sharpest drop in the last decade. ONE OF THE Most Important but elusive quantities in finance is the equity premium, the expected rate of return on the aggregate stock market in ex- cess of the riskless interest rate (the expected \"excess return\"). It is well known that estimates of the equity premium based on historical data can vary widely, depending on the methodology and the sample period, and the imprecision in such estimates can figure prominently in inference and de- cision making. Pa'stor and Stambaugh (1999) conclude, for example, that seven decades of data produce an equity premium estimate whose impreci- sion typically accounts for the largest fraction of uncertainty about a firm's cost of equity. Long histories offer the prospect of increased precision, and researchers have constructed and analyzed series of U.S. Equity returns and interest rates that begin early in the 19th century (e.g., Schwert (1",

    "title": "The Equity Share in New Issues",
    "abstract": "The share of equity issues in total new equity and debt issues is a strong predictor of U.S. Stock market returns between 1928 and 1997. In particular, firms issue relatively more equity than debt just before periods of low market returns. The equity share in new issues has stable predictive power in both halves of the sample period and after controlling for other known predictors. We do not find support for efficient market explanations of the results. Instead, the fact that the equity share sometimes predicts significantly negative market returns suggests inefficiency and that firms time the market component of their returns when issuing securities. IN Their Classic Proof of the irrelevance of financing policy, Modigliani and Miller (1958) implicitly assume market efficiency. If the stock market is inefficient, however, financing policy becomes relevant in obvious ways. When equity prices are too high, existing shareholders benefit by issuing overval- ued equity. When equity prices are too low, issuing debt is preferable. Consistent with this timing hypothesis, firms issuing equity have poor subsequent performance. Stigler (1964), Ritter (1991), Loughran and Ritter (1995), and Speiss and Affleck-Graves (1995) find low average returns after both initial and seasoned offerings.' These studies focus exclusively on is- suer returns relative to some benchmark-the first term in the decomposi- tion Ri = (Ra - Rb) + Rb.

    "title": "The Evolution of Security Designs",
    "abstract": "We consider a competitive and perfect financial market in which agents have het- erogeneous cash flow valuations. Instead of assuming that agents are endowed with rational expectations, we model their behavior as the product of adaptive learning. Our results demonstrate that adaptive learning affects security design profoundly, with securities mispriced even in the long run and optimal designs trading off un- derpricing against intrinsic value maximization. The evolutionary dominant security design calls for issuing securities that engender large losses with a small but positive probability, but that otherwise produce stable payoffs, almost the exact opposite of the pure state claims that are optimal in the rational expectations framework. THE Real Operations OF THE Economy Produce Random Cash Flows . If investors have varying attitudes toward risk, they will have different valuations of these risky cash flows. For this reason, the received wisdom is that investor wel- fare can be improved by sharing rules that allocate risky cash flows among investors. Financial markets can serve as a mechanism for implementing such welfare-improving risk sharing. These markets enable agents with different risk preferences to trade securities and, through their trades, establish equi- librium prices for risky assets. In equilibrium, state prices are determined by the marginal investor’s valuation; and the marginal investor may be different in different states of the world. Although the welfa",

    "abstract": "This paper documents “runs” on asset-backed commercial paper (abcp) programs in 2007. We ﬁnd that one-third of programs experienced a run within weeks of the onset of the Abcp crisis and that runs, as well as yields and maturities for new issues, were related to program-level and macro-ﬁnancial risks. These ﬁndings are consistent with the asymmetric information framework used to explain banking panics, have implications for commercial paper investors’ degree of risk intolerance, and inform empirical predictions of recent papers on dynamic coordination failures. Since THE MID -1980S, Banks have moved an increasing volume of assets off their balance sheets and funded them through asset-backed commercial paper (abcp) programs, bankruptcy-remote “paper companies” that issue short-term debt in the commercial paper market. 1 Traditionally, Abcp programs ﬁnanced receivables from nonﬁnancial companies, but over time they increasingly ﬁ- nanced a wider range of assets, including highly rated mortgage- and other asset-backed securities (ABS). By the end of 2006, Abcp outstanding in the United States had grown to $1.1 trillion, larger than the amount of unsecured (non-asset-backed) commercial paper outstanding and a signiﬁcant part of the U.S. Shadow banking system. However, in the summer 2007, Abcp outstanding began to plummet. The proximate cause of the contraction was mounting concerns about the default risk of subprime and other mortgages.

    "title": "The Executive Turnover Risk Premium",
    "abstract": "We establish that CEOs of companies experiencing volatile industry conditions are more likely to be dismissed. At the same time, accounting for various other factors, industry risk is unlikely to be associated with CEO compensation other than through dismissal risk. Using this identiﬁcation strategy, we document that CEO turnover risk is signiﬁcantly positively associated with compensation. This ﬁnding is important because job-risk-compensating wage differentials arise naturally in competitive labor markets. By contrast, the evidence rejects an entrenchment model according to which powerful CEOs have lower job risk and at the same time secure higher compensation. This Paper INVESTIGATESthe idea that turnover risk is priced in executive com- pensation. In light of the ongoing discussion about pay practices in U.S. Corpora- tions and worldwide, understanding this relationship is of particular interest. A positive association between dismissal risk and pay in the cross section of CEOs is a central prediction of a competitive labor market model. In such a model, pay in “constrained” sectors (where job risk exists and results in costs for dismissed employees) needs to be higher than in “unconstrained” sectors to compensate for job risk (Abowd and Ashenfelter (1981)). Consistent with this hypothesis, our results provide considerable evidence that CEOs who are ex- posed to higher job risk are paid more than CEOs who enjoy more job security.

    "abstract": "We examine 1,948 share lockup agreements that prevent insiders from selling their shares in the period immediately after the IPO (typically 180 days). While lockups are in effect, there is little selling by insiders. When lockups expire, we find a permanent 40 percent increase in average trading volume, and a statistically prom- inent three-day abnormal return of - 1.5 percent. The abnormal return and volume are much larger when the firm is financed by venture capital, and we find that venture capitalists sell more aggressively than executives and other shareholders. We find limited support for several hypotheses that may explain the abnormal return, but no complete explanation. Most Ipos Feature Share Lockup Agreements, which prohibit insiders and other pre-IPO shareholders from selling any of their shares for a specified period. The typical lockup lasts for 180 days, and covers most of the shares that are not sold in the IPO. The terms of the lockup, including the expira- tion or \"unlock\" date, are disclosed in the IPO prospectus. Lockups serve several purposes. They reassure the market that key employees will con- tinue to exert themselves for at least a few months; they provide a credible signal that insiders are not attempting to cash out in advance of imminent bad news; and they may aid the underwriters' price support efforts by tem- porarily constraining the supply of shares.

    "title": "The Exploitation of Relationships",
    "abstract": "This paper develops optimal pricing, lending, and renegotiation strategies for com- panies in relationships where one firm is highly dependent on the other. Long-term trade-creditor firm relationships induce dependent trade creditors to grant more concessions in debt renegotiations than nondependent creditors. Anticipating these larger renegotiation concessions, not only do less financially stable firms prefer trade credit, but all firms agree to pay a higher interest rate for trade credit. The model also explains the existence of \"teaser\" interest rates and convenience classes. Findings are consistent with those of the relationship-lending literature. Trade Credit IS THE Largest Source of short-term financing for American cor- porations. In 1993, trade creditors extended almost $1.5 trillion in credit to their customers. In the same year, the Internal Revenue Service (1997) es- timates that for every dollar in short-term financing provided by credit mar- kets, $1.94 in trade credit was outstanding. Most firms extensively use trade credit despite its apparent greater cost, and trade credit interest rates com- monly exceed 18 percent. Petersen and Rajan (1994, 1995) posit that firms take trade credit when cheaper sources of financing have been exhausted; however, this does not explain why firms with financial slack use trade credit. This paper provides a rationale for trade credit use by analyzing the effect of bilateral relationships on debt renegotiation. In particular, opti",

    "abstract": "We develop a model of monetary policy with two key features: the central bank has private information about its long-run target rate and is averse to bond market volatil- ity. In this setting, the central bank gradually impounds changes in its target into the policy rate. Such gradualism represents an attempt to not spook the bond mar- ket. However, this effort is partially undone in equilibrium, as markets rationally react more to a given move when the central bank moves more gradually. This time- consistency problem means that society would be better off if the central bank cared less about the bond market. FED Watching IS Serious BUSINESSfor bond market investors and for the ﬁnan- cial market press that serves these investors. Speeches and policy statements by Federal Reserve ofﬁcials are dissected word by word for clues they might yield about the future direction of policy. Moreover, the interplay between the central bank and the market goes in two directions: not only is the market keenly interested in making inferences about the Fed’s reaction function, the Fed also takes active steps to learn what market participantsthink the Fed is thinking. In particular, before every Federal Open Market Committee (fomc) meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York performs a detailed survey of primary dealers, asking such questions as “Of the possible outcomes below, provide the percent chance you attach to the timing of the ﬁrst increase in the federal funds target rate or range.",

    "abstract": "We document a surprising pattern in S&P 500 option prices. When implied volatilities are graphed against a standard measure of moneyness, the implied volatility smirk does not flatten out as maturity increases up to the observable horizon of two years. This behavior contrasts sharply with the implications of many pricing models and with the asymptotic behavior implied by the central limit theorem (CLT). We develop a parsimonious model which deliberately vio- lates the CLT assumptions and thus captures the observed behavior of the vo- latility smirk over the maturity horizon. Calibration exercises demonstrate its superior performance against several widely used alternatives. Ever Since THE Stock Market Crash of 1987, the U.S. Stock index options market has been exhibiting a consistent pattern documented by academics and practitioners alike. At a given maturity level, the Black and Scholes (1973) implied volatilities for out-of-the-money puts are much higher than those of out-of-the-money calls.1 This phenomenon is commonly referred to as the \"volatility smirk.\" It is, however, less well known that these implied volatilities also exhibit a strong empirical regularity in the maturity direction.2 When implied volatilities are graphed against a standard measure of \"moneyness:' we document that the resulting implied volatility smirk does not flatten out as maturity increases up to the observable horizon of two years.

Raising the capital requirement makes the bank safer, which alleviates this problem. We refer to this mechanism, which we argue is empirically relevant, as theforced safety effect . Since THE Global Financial Crisis , bank capital requirements have been substantially tightened.1 The merits of these reforms have been ﬁercely de- bated. Critics argue that higher capital requirements raise banks’ cost of funds, thereby reducing credit provision and dampening economic activity .2 Others, however, argue that increases in banks’ private cost of funds are not necessarily relevant from a normative perspective (see, for example, Hanson, Kashyap, and Stein (2011) and Admati et al. (2013)). Nonetheless, the idea London. We are indebted to the Editor Philip Bond, the Associate Editors, and two anonymous referees.

    "title": "The Foundations of Freezeout Laws",
    "abstract": "We provide an economic basis for permitting freezeouts of nontendering shareholders following successful takeovers. We describe a specific freezeout mechanism based on easily verifiable information that induces desirable efficiency and welfare properties in models of both corporations with widely dispersed shareholdings and corporations with large pivotal shareholders. The mechanism dominates previous proposals along some important dimensions. We also examine takeover premia that arise in the pres- ence of competition among raiders. Our mechanism is closely related to the practice of takeover law in the United States; thus, our analysis may be thought of as analyzing the economic foundations of current regulations. Grossman AND Hart (1980) Point OUT that free-riding considerations could thwart takeovers of widely held corporations where each shareholder is negligibly small. Anticipating that the post-takeover value of the raider-run firm will exceed the tender price, target shareholders prefer holding on to their shares and free-riding on the raider’s improvement in firm value to tendering. Thus, no shareholder tenders and raids fail even if they are value-increasing. Grossman and Hart argue that to enable takeovers to succeed, an exclusionary mechanism is needed that deters free-riding by “punishing” nontendering shareholders. The economic desirability of an exclusionary mechanism depends on more than just its deterrence of free-riding. By influencing the likelihood of suc-",

    "abstract": "Variable annuities, which package mutual funds with minimum return guarantees over long horizons, accounted for $1.5 trillion or 35% of U.S. Life insurer liabilities in 2015. Sales decreased and fees increased during the global ﬁnancial crisis, and in- surers made guarantees less generous or stopped offering guarantees to reduce risk exposure. These effects persist in the low-interest rate environment after the global ﬁnancial crisis, and variable annuity insurers suffered large equity drawdowns dur- ing the Covid-19 crisis. We develop and estimate a model of insurance markets in which ﬁnancial frictions and market power determine pricing, contract characteris- tics, and the degree of market completeness.

    "abstract": "I study the incentives of the collateral managers who selected securities for ABS CDOs—securitizations that ﬁgured prominently in the ﬁnancial crisis. Specialized managers without other businesses that could suffer negative reputational conse- quences invested in low-quality securities underwritten by the CDO’s arranger. These securities performed signiﬁcantly worse than observationally similar securities. Man- agers investing in these securities were rewarded with additional collateral manage- ment assignments. Diversiﬁed managers who did assemble CDOs suffered negative reputational consequences during the crisis: institutional investors withdrew from their mutual funds. Overall, the results are consistent with a quid pro quo between collateral managers and CDO underwriters. Structured Products Such AS Private -label residential mortgage-backed se- curities (rmbs) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were at the heart of the recent credit boom and the 2007 to 2009 ﬁnancial crisis. Given the role of these securities in the crisis, researchers have analyzed the incentives of the loan originators, 1 credit ratings agencies, 2 and underwriters 3 bringing these securities to the market. The literature has also started to explore the demand for securitizations, pointing to the reliance on credit ratings and regulatory arbitrage on the one hand 4 and the neglect of risk on the other hand. 5 Most of the demand for the non-AAA-rated tranches of private-label Rmbs, however, came",

Forty-ﬁve percent of the gap is explained by transaction timing and location. The remaining gap arises from a 2% gender difference in execution prices at purchase and sale. Consistent with a negotiation channel, women list for less and experience worse negotiated discounts. The gender gap shrinks in tight markets, where nego- tiation is replaced by quasi-auctions. Overall, gender differences in housing explain 30% of the gender gap in wealth accumulation for the median household.

    "abstract": "Using a large sample of partial block acquisitions, we examine the importance of geographic proximity in corporate governance and target returns. We find that block acquirers have a strong preference for geographically proximate targets and acquirers that purchase shares in such targets are more likely to engage in post-acquisition target governance activities than are remote block acquirers. Moreover, the targets of these acquirers realize higher announcement returns and better post-acquisition operating performance than do targets of other types of acquirers, particularly when they face greater information asymmetries. IT IS Well Known That Despite THE Substantial Gains from international diversi- fication, investors exhibit a strong preference for domestic stocks (French and Poterba (1991), Kang and Stultz (1997)). Recent studies show that this so-called home bias phenomenon in international portfolio selection exists even in domes- tic portfolio selection, and that investment returns in local holdings are higher than those in nonlocal holdings. For example, Coval and Moskowitz (1999) show that U.S. Mutual fund managers exhibit a strong preference for local stocks, and using data on individual investments, Zhu (2002) and Ivkovic and Weisbenner (2005) find that a strong preference for local stocks also exists for individual investors.

    "abstract": "I provide evidence that geographically proximate analysts are more accurate than other analysts. Stock returns immediately surrounding forecast revisions suggest that local analysts impact prices more than other analysts. These effects are strongest for firms located in small cities and remote areas. Collectively these results sug- gest that geographically proximate analysts possess an information advantage over other analysts, and that this advantage translates into better performance. The well- documented underwriter affiliation bias in stock recommendations is concentrated among distant affiliated analysts; recommendations by local affiliated analysts are unbiased. This finding reveals a geographic component to the agency problems in the industry. This Paper Investigates THE Effect OF Distance on the accuracy and investment value of equity analysts’ forecasts and recommendations. Using a large panel of analyst data from 1994 to 2001, I provide evidence that geographically prox- imate analysts outperform their distant counterparts. Specifically, local ana- lysts are significantly more accurate than other analysts. I find this effect to be strongest in small firms, in firms located outside of the most populated cities, and in firms located in remote areas.

    "abstract": "This paper documents aggregate trends in the foreign listings of companies, and analyzes their distinctive prelisting characteristics and postlisting performance. In 1986-1997, many European companies listed abroad, mainly on U.S. Exchanges, while the number of U.S. Companies listed in Europe decreased. European compa- nies that cross-list tend to be large and recently privatized firms, and expand their foreign sales after listing abroad. They differ sharply depending on where they cross-list: The U.S. Exchanges attract high-tech and export-oriented companies that expand rapidly without significant leveraging. Companies cross-listing within Eu- rope do not grow unusually fast, and increase their leverage after cross-listing. Foreign Listings ARE Becoming an increasingly important strategic issue for companies and stock exchanges alike. As companies become global in their product market and investment strategies, direct access to foreign capital markets via an equity listing can yield important benefits. At the same time, the international integration of capital markets has led to unprecedented levels of competition among stock exchanges. In this competitive struggle, the winners are the exchanges that manage to attract more foreign listings and the attendant trading volume and business opportunities. Despite the importance of these issues, still little is known about which exchanges succeed in capturing more listings from abroad and why. This question is intimately related to",

    "abstract": "Financial misconduct (FM) rates differ widely between major U.S. Cities, up to a fac- tor of 3. Although spatial differences in enforcement and ﬁrm characteristics do not account for these patterns, city-level norms appear to be very important. For exam- ple, FM rates are strongly related to other unethical behavior, involving politicians, doctors, and (potentially unfaithful) spouses, in the city. Traditional models of crime begin with Becker (1968), who frames the choice to engage in misbehavior like any other economic decision involving cost-beneﬁt tradeoffs. Though somewhat successful when taken to the data, the theory fails to account for the enormous variation in crime rates observed across both time and space. Indeed, as Glaeser, Sacerdote, and Scheinkman (1996) argue, regional variation in demographics, enforcement, and other observables is simply not large enough to explain why, for example, two seemingly identical neighborhoods in the same city have drastically different crime rates.1 Their conclusion is that social factors—culture—play an important role in a person’s decision to break rules, or to respect them. In this paper, we attempt to quantify the importance of social norms in white collar crimes, exploiting geography as the main source of variation.

Furthermore, the model captures certain determinants of corporate bond market frictions across the eight economies and substantially im- proves the cross-sectional ﬁt of individual IG credit spreads.

We use a factor model to predict crisis returns, deﬁning unexplained increases in factor loadings and residual correlations as indicative of con- tagion. While we ﬁnd evidence of contagion from the United States and the global ﬁ- nancial sector, the effects are small. By contrast, there has been substantial contagion from domestic markets to individual domestic portfolios, with its severity inversely related to the quality of countries’ economic fundamentals. This conﬁrms the “wake- up call” hypothesis, with markets focusing more on country-speciﬁc characteristics during the crisis. Ever Since THE Seminal work of King and Wadhwani (1990) following the October 1987 global stock market crash, the international ﬁnance literature has studied how shocks are transmitted across borders. Words with negative connotations such as “volatility spillovers” (e.g., Engle, Ito, and Lin (1990), Masulis, Hamao, and Ng (1990)) and “contagion” have been coined to indicate shock transmission that cannot be explained by fundamentals or comovements that are viewed as “excessive.” Countless papers have been written proposing quantitative measures of contagion (see Karolyi (2003) and Dungey et al.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate how globalization is reﬂected in asset prices. We use shipping costs to measure ﬁrms’ exposure to globalization. Firms in low shipping cost industries carry a 7% risk premium, suggesting that their cash ﬂows covary negatively with investors’ marginal utility. We ﬁnd that the premium emanates from the risk of displacement of least efﬁcient ﬁrms triggered by import competition. These ﬁndings suggest that foreign productivity shocks are associated with times when consumption is dear for investors. We discuss conditions under which a standard model of trade with asset prices can rationalize this puzzle. Recent Decades Have Been Characterized by a high degree of trade integration. This era of globalization 1 is generally seen in a positive light, as it has been associated with more product variety at lower prices, cheaper intermediate goods, and greater access for U.S. ﬁrms to foreign markets. 2 Yet globalization also makes domestic economies more sensitive to foreign shocks.

In this paper, we show that these two sources of risk-taking, relative and absolute performance rewards, mitigate the risk-taking incentives produced by the other.

    "abstract": "The idea that extreme trading activity contains information about the future evo- lution of stock prices is investigated. We find that stocks experiencing unusually high (low) trading volume over a day or a week tend to appreciate (depreciate) over the course of the following month. We argue that this high-volume return premium is consistent with the idea that shocks in the trading activity of a stock affect its visibility, and in turn the subsequent demand and price for that stock. Return autocorrelations, firm announcements, market risk, and liquidity do not seem to explain our results. THE Objective OF This Paper is to investigate the role of trading activity in terms of the information it contains about future prices. More precisely, we are interested in the power of trading volume in predicting the direction of future price movements. We find that individual stocks whose trading ac- tivity is unusually large (small) over periods of a day or a week, as measured by trading volume during those periods, tend to experience large (small) returns over the subsequent month. In other words, a high-volume return premium seems to exist in stock prices. The essence of our paper's results is captured in Figure 1. In this figure, we show the evolution of the average cumulative return of three groups of stocks: stocks that experienced unusu- ally high, unusually low, and normal trading volume, relative to their recent history of trading volume, on the trading day preceding the portfoli",

    "title": "The Illiquidity of Corporate Bonds",
    "abstract": "This paper examines the illiquidity of corporate bonds and its asset-pricing impli- cations. Using transactions data from 2003 to 2009, we show that the illiquidity in corporate bonds is substantial, signiﬁcantly greater than what can be explained by bid–ask spreads. We establish a strong link between bond illiquidity and bond prices. In aggregate, changes in market-level illiquidity explain a substantial part of the time variation in yield spreads of high-rated (AAA through A) bonds, overshadowing the credit risk component. In the cross-section, the bond-level illiquidity measure explains individual bond yield spreads with large economic signiﬁcance. THE Illiquidity OF THE U.S. Corporate bond market has captured the interest and attention of researchers, practitioners, and policy makers alike. The fact that illiquidity is important in the pricing of corporate bonds is widely recog- nized, but the evidence is mostly qualitative and indirect. In particular, our understanding remains limited with respect to the relative importance of illiq- uidity and credit risk in determining corporate bond spreads and how their importance varies with market conditions. The ﬁnancial crisis of 2008 has brought renewed interest and a sense of urgency to this topic, as concerns over both illiquidity and credit risk intensiﬁed at the same time and it was not clear which factor was the dominating force in driving up corporate bond spreads. The main objective of this paper is to directly assess the",

    "abstract": "We estimate the impact of bank merger announcements on borrowers’ stock prices for publicly traded Norwegian firms. Borrowers of target banks lose about 0.8% in equity value, while borrowers of acquiring banks earn positive abnormal returns, suggesting that borrower welfare is influenced by a strategic focus favoring acquiring borrowers. Bank mergers lead to higher relationship exit rates among borrowers of target banks. Larger merger-induced increases in relationship termination rates are associated with less negative abnormal returns, suggesting that firms with low switching costs switch banks, while similar firms with high switching costs are locked into their current relationship. HOW DO Mergers Affect THE Welfare OF Borrowers ? Understanding the implica- tions of consolidation activity on customer welfare has been one of the defining issues in the merger literature. The impact of mergers in the banking sector is particularly important because bank debt is a pervasive form of corporate financing across virtually every industry and all types of firms. Thus, shocks created by bank mergers have the potential to impact entire economies. More- over, spurred by two decades of deregulation, banks around the world con- tinue to merge.

    "abstract": "We provide evidence that the deregulation of U.S. State banking markets leads to a signiﬁcant increase in the relative employment and capital growth of local ﬁrms with higher productivity, and that this effect is concentrated among young ﬁrms. Using ﬁnancial data for a broad range of ﬁrms, our analysis suggests that this effect is driven by a shift in the composition of local bank credit supply toward more productive ﬁrms. We estimate that this effect translates into economically important gains in aggregate industry productivity and that changes in the allocation of labor play a central role in driving these gains. A Growing Body OF Evidence SUGGESTSthat improvements in ﬁnancial markets can signiﬁcantly contribute to economic growth and that increases in aggregate productivity play a central role in this process.1 Despite the importance of this idea, we still have limited direct evidence on the speciﬁc economic mechanisms through which ﬁnance affects growth and productivity. In this paper, we study the role of local U.S. Banking markets in shifting the allocation of labor and capital within local industries toward ﬁrms with higher productivity. Intu- itively, such reallocation changes the composition of an industry and plays an important role in increasing the industry’s aggregate productivity as it allows a given level of aggregate resources to generate more output.2 Banks can Mark Garmaise; John Haltiwanger; Javier Miranda; Marco Navone; Vincenzo Quadrini; Geoffrey Tate; M",

    "title": "The Impact of Collateralization on Swap Rates",
    "abstract": "Interest rate swap pricing theory traditionally views swaps as a portfolio of forward contracts with net swap payments discounted at Libor rates. In practice, the use of marking-to-market and collateralization questions this view as they introduce in- termediate cash flows and alter credit characteristics. We provide a swap valuation theory under marking-to-market and costly collateral and examine the theory’s empir- ical implications. We find evidence consistent with costly collateral using two different approaches; the first uses single-factor models and Eurodollar futures prices, and the second uses a formal term structure model and Treasury/swap data. THE Traditional Approach TO Interest Rate swap valuation (Sundaresan (1991a) and Duffie and Singleton (1997)) treats a swap as a portfolio of forward contracts on the underlying floating interest rate. Under specific assumptions regarding the nature of default and the credit risk of the counterparties, Duffie and Sin- gleton (1997) prove that swap rates are par bond rates of an issuer who remains at Libor quality throughout the life of the contract. This result is extremely useful for extracting zero-coupon bond prices, pricing swap derivatives, and testing spot rate models. Despite the popularity of the traditional view, market practice brings into question some of the underlying assumptions of this approach. As the swap market rapidly grew in the late 1980s and early 1990s, an increasingly di- verse group of counterparties",

    "abstract": "We develop a technique to assess the impact of changes in mortgage markets on house- holds, exploiting an implication of the permanent income hypothesis: The higher a household’s expected future income, the higher its desired consumption, ceteris paribus. With perfect credit markets, desired consumption matches actual consump- tion and current spending forecasts future income. Because credit market imperfec- tions mute this effect, the extent to which house spending predicts future income measures the “imperfectness” of mortgage markets. Using micro-data, we ﬁnd that since the early 1980s, mortgage markets have become less imperfect in this sense, and securitization has played an important role. THE U.S. Mortgage Market has experienced phenomenal change over the last 35 years. Gone are the days when most households get a cookie-cutter, 30-year, ﬁxed-rate, level-payment mortgage from a savings and loan that takes deposits at 3% and lends at 6%. Also gone are the days when the typical lender holds that mortgage on its books until the maturity of the loan. Today, consumers choose from an extensive menu of mortgages offering ﬂexibility along almost every dimension. Furthermore, most lenders hold the mortgage for only a short time; typically, they sell the mortgage on the secondary market. Many researchers have argued that this transformation has enhanced efﬁ- ciency by integrating the mortgage market with the broader ﬁnancial markets. Even whether the transformation of mortgage m",

    "abstract": "In 2002 and 2003, many Chinese banks implemented reforms that delegated authority to individual loan ofﬁcers. The change followed China’s entrance into the WTO and offers a plausibly exogenous shock to loan ofﬁcer incentives to produce information. We ﬁnd that the bank’s internal risk rating becomes a stronger predictor of loan interest rates and ex post outcomes after reform. When the loan ofﬁcer and the branch president who approves the loan work together longer, the rating also becomes more strongly related to loan prices and outcomes. Our results highlight how incentives and communication costs affect information production and use. High-quality Information is essential for successful business transactions. A growing literature emphasizes how both individual incentives and the cost of communication to decision-making authorities affect the production and use of information. In this paper, we study how banks use information to set loan interest rates, how that information forecasts future outcomes (default), and how the quality (predictive power) of information production varies with incentives and communication costs. We use data from China, which historically has been dominated by large and inefﬁcient state-owned banks that rely on centralized decision-making pro- cesses.

    "abstract": "This paper examines continuous-time stochastic volatility models incorporat- ing jumps in returns and volatility. We develop a likelihood-based estimation strategy and provide estimates of parameters, spot volatility, jump times, and jump sizes using S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 index returns. Estimates of jump times, jump sizes, and volatility are particularly useful for identifying the ef- fects of these factors during periods of market stress, such as those in 1987, 1997, and 1998. Using formal and informal diagnostics, we find strong evidence for jumps in volatility and jumps in returns. Finally, we study how these fac- tors and estimation risk impact option pricing. A Surprising Recent Finding Indicates that models with both diffusive stochastic volatility and jumps in returns are incapable of fully capturing the empirical fea- tures of equity index returns or option prices (see, e.g., Bakshi, Cao, and Chen (1997), Bates (2000), and Pan (2002)). Empirical evidence indicates that the condi- tional volatility of returns rapidly increases, a movement difficult to generate using a diffusion specification for volatility and jumps in returns.1 In this paper, we propose to remedy this problem by incorporating jumps in stochastic volati- lity, and we provide empirical evidence supporting the presence and importance of this additional factor. Intuitively, what is it that jumps in volatility provide that jumps in returns and diffusive stochastic volatility cannot? Jumps in returns can g",

    "abstract": "We study links between the labor market for loan ofﬁcers and access to mortgage credit. Using novel data matching mortgage applications to loan ofﬁcers, we ﬁnd that minorities are underrepresented among loan ofﬁcers. Minority borrowers are less likely to complete mortgage applications, have completed applications approved, and to ultimately take up a loan. These disparities are reduced when minority borrowers work with minority loan ofﬁcers. These pairings also lead to lower de- fault rates, suggesting minority loan ofﬁcers have an informational advantage with minority borrowers.

    "abstract": "I study the effect of removing repossession risk on a mortgagor’s decision to de- fault. Reducing default costs may result in strategic default, particularly during crises when homeowners can be substantially underwater. I analyze difference-in- differences variation in repossession risk generated by an unexpected legal ruling in Ireland that prohibited collateral enforcement on delinquent residential mortgages originated before a particular date. I estimate that borrowers defaulted by 0.3 per- centage points more each quarter after the ruling, a relative increase of approxi- mately one-half. High loan-to-value ratios and low liquidity are associated with a larger treatment effect, suggesting both equity and consumption-based motivations. During Economic Crises , Governments often consider debt relief poli- cies that reduce repossession risk for mortgage borrowers, such as foreclo- sure moratoria, because of the negative externalities and social disruption of widespread evictions. 1 However, these policies come with a potentially large moral hazard cost.

    "abstract": "We test whether the display of information causally affects investor behavior in a high- stakes trading environment. Using investor-level brokerage data from China and a natural experiment, we estimate the impact of a shock that increased the salience of a stock’s purchase price but did not change the investor’s information set. We em- ploy a difference-in-differences approach and ﬁnd that the salience shock causally increased the disposition effect by 17%. We use microdata to document substantial heterogeneity across investors in the treatment effect. A previously documented trad- ing pattern, the “rank effect,” explains heterogeneity in the change in the disposition effect. IN Most Models OF Investor behavior, the manner in which information is displayed has little impact on portfolio choice. Yet, evidence from several affect investor behavior. For example, manipulating the presentation of an asset’s past performance can affect subjects’ risk-taking (Gneezy and Potters (1997), Thaler et al. ( 1997)), mutual fund choice (Choi, Madrian, and Laibson (2010)), and willingness to sell losing stocks (Frydman and Rangel ( 2014)). Display would also have a large effect on trading decisions.

    "abstract": "We explore the impact of supervision on the riskiness, proﬁtability, and growth of U.S. Banks. Using data on supervisors’ time use, we demonstrate that the top-ranked banks by size within a supervisory district receive more attention from supervisors, even after controlling for size, complexity, risk, and other characteristics. Using a matched sample approach, we ﬁnd that these top-ranked banks that receive more supervisory attention hold less risky loan portfolios, are less volatile, and are less sensitive to industry downturns, but do not have lower growth or proﬁtability. Our results underscore the distinct role of supervision in mitigating banking sector risk. Supervision AND Regulation ARE critical tools for the promotion of sta- bility and soundness in the ﬁnancial sector. Despite supervision’s key role, it is rarely examined separately from regulation and relatively little is known about the distinct impact of supervisory efforts. In this paper, we exploit new supervisory data and develop a novel identiﬁcation strategy to estimate the impact of greater supervision on bank risk-taking and performance. We ﬁnd that more supervision adds value over and above the effects of regulation. In particular, banks that receive more supervisory attention have less risky loan portfolios, are less volatile, and are less sensitive to industry downturns, but do not exhibit lower growth or proﬁtability.

    "abstract": "We show that venture capitalists’ (VCs) on-site involvement with their portfolio com- panies leads to an increase in both innovation and the likelihood of a successful exit. We rule out selection effects by exploiting an exogenous source of variation in VC involvement: the introduction of new airline routes that reduce VCs’ travel times to their existing portfolio companies. We conﬁrm the importance of this channel by con- ducting a large-scale survey of VCs, of whom almost 90% indicate that direct ﬂights increase their interaction with their portfolio companies and management, and help them better understand companies’ activities. IT IS Often Argued that venture capital (VC) plays an important role in promot- ing innovation and growth. Consistent with this belief, governments around the world have pursued a number of policies aimed at fostering VC activity (Lerner (2009)). However, evidence that the activities of VCs actually play a causal role in stimulating the creation of innovative and successful companies is scarce. It could be the case, for instance, that VCs simply select companies that are poised to innovate and succeed, even absent their involvement. In this paper, we examine whether the activities of VCs do affect portfolio company outcomes. An ideal experiment to establish the impact of VCs would be to randomly provide certain companies with VC funding and others not.

    "abstract": "We represent the economy as a network of industries connected through customer and supplier trade ﬂows. Using this network topology, we ﬁnd that stronger product market connections lead to a greater incidence of cross-industry mergers. Further- more, mergers propagate in waves across the network through customer-supplier links. Merger activity transmits to close industries quickly and to distant industries with a delay. Finally, economy-wide merger waves are driven by merger activity in in- dustries that are centrally located in the product market network. Overall, we show that the network of real economic transactions helps to explain the formation and propagation of merger waves. A Growing Body OF evidence shows that industry characteristics affect many ﬁrm decisions, including ﬁnancial policy (MacKay and Phillips (2005)), inter- nal capital markets (Lamont (1997)), and corporate governance (Giroud and between ﬁrms and their industry rivals have important implications for funda- mental questions in ﬁnancial economics. We broaden this analysis by making a simple, though consequential, observation: industries do not exist in isola- tion, but rather are connected through a complex network of customer-supplier relationships. This implies that whole industries may be affected by shocks that are transmitted through the customer-supplier network.

    "abstract": "We examine the effect of industry life-cycle stages on within-industry acquisitions and capital expenditures by conglomerates and single-segment firms controlling for endogeneity of organizational form. We find greater differences in acquisitions than in capital expenditures, which are similar across organizational types. In particular, 36% of the growth recorded by conglomerate segments in growth industries comes from acquisitions, versus 9% for single-segment firms. In growth industries, the effect of fi- nancial dependence on acquisitions and plant openings is mitigated for conglomerate firms. Plants acquired by conglomerate firms increase in productivity. The results suggest that organizational forms’ comparative advantages differ across industry conditions. Stages and that these stages are characterized by marked differences in invest- ment and restructuring activity (Gort and Klepper (1982), Jovanovic (1982), Klepper and Grady (1990), Klepper (1996)). The evidence suggests that changes in the number of firms in an industry occur at times of transition in an industry’s life cycle, that is, when the producers’ competitive advantages are changing. However, it is not known whether and how firm organization is associated with firm performance for industries that experience changes in exogenous long-run conditions.

    "abstract": "Contrary to the implications of many payout theories, we find that announcements of open-market share repurchase programs are not followed by an increase in operat- ing performance. However, we find that repurchasing firms experience a significant reduction in systematic risk and cost of capital relative to non-repurchasing firms. Further, consistent with the free cash-flow hypothesis, we find that the market reac- tion to share repurchase announcements is more positive among those firms that are more likely to overinvest. Finally, we find evidence to indicate that investors under- react to repurchase announcements because they initially underestimate the decline in cost of capital. IN Recent Years Open-market share repurchase programs have become an impor- tant payout method for many U.S. Firms. According to data from Compustat, between 1984 and 2000 corporations spent approximately 26 percent of their total annual earnings on repurchases. Over 90 percent of these repurchases were open-market repurchase programs. Also, in 1999 and 2000, for the first time in history, industrial corporations spent more money on share repurchases than they did on dividends. Our objective in this paper is to better understand the economic motivations behind the decision to repurchase shares. Two major reasons for repurchasing shares are analyzed in the theoretical literature. The first is that management uses open-market share repurchases to signal better prospects (Bhattacharya (1979), Miller",

    "abstract": "A number of firms in the United Kingdom list without issuing equity and then issue equity shortly thereafter. We argue that this two-stage offering strategy is less costly than an initial public offering (IPO) because trading reduces the valuation uncertainty of these firms before they issue equity. We find that initial returns are 10% to 30% lower for these firms than for comparable IPOs, and we provide evidence that the market in the firm’s shares lowers financing costs. We also show that these firms time the market both when they list and when they issue equity. ONE Typical Feature OF AN Initial Public Offering is that the firm lists and issues equity simultaneously. As such, the value of the shares sold is inherently subject to great uncertainty, which results in underpricing. Rock (1986) argues that if both informed and uninformed investors are to purchase shares in the IPO, un- derpricing is necessary to attract uninformed investors. Similarly, Benveniste and Spindt (1989) argue that if some investors have better information about the value of the shares than the underwriter, the underwriter can extract this information by rewarding informed investors with underpriced shares. No mat- ter who benefits from an informational advantage, however, the IPO literature agrees that uncertainty is costly for issuers. To reduce valuation uncertainty, a natural solution for firms wishing to raise equity is to proceed in two stages, listing and letting develop a public market in the",

    "title": "The Insurance Is the Lemon: Failing to",
    "abstract": "We model the widespread failure of contracts to share risk using available indices. A borrower and lender can share risk by conditioning repayments on an index. The lender has private information about the ability of this index to measure the true state that the borrower would like to hedge. The lender is risk-averse and thus requires a premium to insure the borrower. The borrower, however, might be paying something for nothing if the index is a poor measure of the true state. We provide sufﬁcient conditions for this effect to cause the borrower to choose a nonindexed contract instead. A Central Implication OF THE Literature on ﬁnancial contracting is that agents should structure contracts to share risk as efﬁciently as possible. In many ﬁ- nancial markets, standard contracts are simple and do not include risk-sharing arrangements that condition payments on publicly available indices. A leading example of this phenomenon is the mortgage market. In this market, home- owners are exposed to the risk that their homes will decline in value. Lenders are arguably better equipped to bear this risk and could insulate homeowners against declines in house prices by making mortgage repayment terms con- tingent on a house-price index. These types of mortgage contracts have been widely proposed as a solution to problems facing the mortgage market, such as the subprime default crises of 2007, 1 but have failed to supplant the standard Francesca Carapella; Eduardo Davila; Peter DeMarzo; Emma",

    "abstract": "We develop a dynamic multiequation model where ﬁrms make ﬁnancing and invest- ment decisions jointly subject to the constraint that sources must equal uses of cash. We argue that static models of ﬁnancial decisions produce inconsistent coefﬁcient esti- mates, and that models that do not acknowledge the interdependence among decision variables produce inefﬁcient estimates and provide an incomplete and potentially misleading view of ﬁnancial behavior. We use our model to examine whether ﬁrms are constrained from accessing capital markets. Unlike static single-equation studies that ﬁnd ﬁrms underinvest given cash ﬂow shortfalls, we conclude that ﬁrms maintain investment by borrowing. Empirical Studies IN CORPORATEﬁnance routinely examine ﬁrms’ ﬁnancial pol- icy decisions in isolation. In particular, they use a single-equation framework wherein the relevant policy variable is regressed on a set of explanatory vari- ables. For example, tests of payout policy often regress payout measures on a variety of ﬁnancial variables without explicitly accounting for the interdepen- dence between payout policy and other corporate policies. Similar approaches are used to study capital structure, management compensation, and various other ﬁnancing and investment decisions. In practice, however, investment and ﬁnancing decisions are related by ac- counting identities. In adjusting any one policy variable, ﬁrms are constrained by the fact that sources of cash must equal uses of cash, implying tha",

    "abstract": "Using a large proprietary database of institutional trades, this paper examines the in- terim (intraquarter) trading skills of institutional investors. We ﬁnd strong evidence that institutional investors earn signiﬁcant abnormal returns on their trades within the trading quarter and that interim trading performance is persistent. After trans- actions costs, our estimates suggest that interim trading skills contribute between 20 and 26 basis points per year to the average fund’s abnormal performance. Our ﬁndings also indicate that any trading skills documented by previous studies that use quarterly data are biased downwards because of their inability to account for interim trades. Financial Economists Often refer to institutional investors as “informed” traders, and individuals attempting to trade in the same markets as insti- tutions are likened to “tourists playing poker with professionals in the smoky backroom of a Las Vegas casino.”1 In spite of this conventional wisdom, empiri- cal evidence on institutional investors’ ability to generate positive abnormal re- turns is mixed.

Internal governance can mitigate agency problems and ensure that ﬁrms have substantial value, even with little or no external governance by investors. External governance, even if crude and uninformed, can complement internal governance and improve efﬁciency. This leads to a theory of investment and dividend policy, in which dividends are paid by self-interested CEOs to maintain a balance between internal and external control. The people you pay are more important over time than the people who pay you.1 A Public CORPORATIONis commonly viewed as an organization run by CEOs and monitored by a board of directors on behalf of shareholders. This governance structure separates decision management (by the CEO and other managers) from decision control (by the board) and from investment and risk-bearing (by public shareholders), and is viewed as reasonable and efﬁcient (Fama and Jensen (1983a, 1983b) and Jensen (2000)) provided that decisions are made to maximize the value of shareholders’ residual claim. Many public corporations thrive under this governance structure. Yet the clear evidence that public corporations “work” has to be set against the equally clear evidence that most shareholders have little control over boards (Monks (2008)) and that many boards treat CEOs generously (Bebchuk and Fried (2004)). CEOs are self interested, and",

    "abstract": "We identify the international credit channel by exploiting Mexican supervisory data sets and foreign monetary policy shocks in a country with a large presence of Euro- pean and U.S. Banks. A softening of foreign monetary policy expands credit supply of foreign banks (e.g., U.K. Policy affects credit supply in Mexico via U.K. Banks), inducing strong ﬁrm-level real effects. Results support an international risk-taking channel and spillovers of core countries’ monetary policies to emerging markets, both in the foreign monetary softening part (with higher credit and liquidity risk-taking by foreign banks) and in the tightening part (with negative local ﬁrm-level real effects). THE Recent Global Financial Crisis , as well as other previous crises, have shown that bank credit cycles have a signiﬁcant effect on the economy, ﬁ- nancial globalization can impact ﬁnancial stability, and monetary policy may be a key public policy tool (Bernanke ( 1983), Reinhart and Rogoff ( 2009), Schularick and Taylor ( 2012)).

    "title": "The International Transmission of Bank",
    "abstract": "I exploit the 1998 Russian default as a negative liquidity shock to international banks and analyze its transmission to Peru. I ﬁnd that after the shock international banks reduce bank-to-bank lending to Peruvian banks and Peruvian banks reduce lending to Peruvian ﬁrms. The effect is strongest for domestically owned banks that bor- row internationally, intermediate for foreign-owned banks, and weakest for locally funded banks. I control for credit demand by examining ﬁrms that borrow from sev- eral banks. These results suggest that international banks transmit liquidity shocks across countries and that negative liquidity shocks reduce bank lending in affected countries. AN Important Question IN Finance is whether ﬁnancial institutions transmit liquidity shocks across markets, and if so, whether such shocks impact real economic activity. On the one hand, efﬁcient market theory suggests that, as long as investment opportunities are constant, shocks to ﬁnancial institutions in one market should not affect lending in other markets. On the other hand, if ﬁnancing frictions prevent ﬁnancial institutions from accessing alternative ﬁnancing sources to cover shortfalls, then liquidity shocks in one market may affect lending in other markets.

    "abstract": "Stocks with large increases in call (put) implied volatilities over the previous month tend to have high (low) future returns. Sorting stocks ranked into decile portfolios by past call implied volatilities produces spreads in average returns of approximately 1% per month, and the return differences persist up to six months. The cross sec- tion of stock returns also predicts option implied volatilities, with stocks with high past returns tending to have call and put option contracts that exhibit increases in implied volatility over the next month, but with decreasing realized volatility. These predictability patterns are consistent with rational models of informed trading. Options ARE Redundant ASSETSonly in an idealized world of complete markets with no transactions costs, perfect information, and no restrictions on shorting. Not surprisingly, since in the real world none of these assumptions hold, options are not simply functions of underlying stock prices and risk-free securities.1 We show that the cross section of option volatilities contains information that forecasts the cross section of expected stock returns, and the cross section of stock-level characteristics forecasts option implied volatilities. In the direction of option volatilities predicting stock returns, we ﬁnd that stocks with call options that have experienced increases in implied volatilities over the past month tend to have high returns over the next month.

    "abstract": "The “annuity puzzle,” conveying the apparently low interest of retirees in longevity insurance, is central to household ﬁnance. Two possible explanations are “public care aversion” (PCA), retiree aversion to simultaneously running out of wealth and being in need of long-term care, and an intentional bequest motive. To disentangle the relative importance of PCA and bequest motive, we estimate a structural model of the retirement phase using a novel survey instrument that includes hypothetical questions. We identify PCA as very signiﬁcant and ﬁnd bequest motives that spread deep into the middle class. Our results highlight potential interest in annuities that make allowance for long-term care expenses. IN A World without bequest motives and with complete markets, a household should fully annuitize and consume all wealth before death (Yaari (1965)). In reality, Dynan, Skinner, and Zeldes (2004) and De Nardi, French, and Jones (2010) show that assets of the old decrease slowly if at all, and many die with signiﬁcant wealth in the form of housing equity and liquid assets. Similarly, only a small fraction of households annuitize. This “annuity puzzle,” whereby retiree demand for annuities is far lower than economic models predict, has generated much work within the academic community. More broadly, there has been a surge of interest in using portfolio-theoretic models to address questions of retirement ﬁnancial security. ∗Ameriks is from Vanguard; Caplin, Laufer, and Van Nieuwerbur",

    "abstract": "The primary challenge to assessing the legal origins view of comparative ﬁnancial de- velopment is identifying exogenous changes in legal systems. We assemble new data on Shanghai’s British and French concessions between 1845 and 1936. Two regime changes altered British and French legal jurisdiction over their respective conces- sions. By examining the changing application of different legal traditions to adjacent neighborhoods within the same city and controlling for military , economic, and po- litical characteristics, we offer new evidence consistent with the legal origins view: the ﬁnancial development advantage in the British concession widened after Western legal jurisdiction intensiﬁed and narrowed after it abated. THE Legal Origins View OF comparative ﬁnancial development stresses that economies with a common law tradition better protect private contracts and investors, enhancing the functioning of ﬁnancial markets and institutions (La Porta et al. (1997, 1998)). This view further asserts that legal traditions de- veloped in Europe spread to other countries through conquest and coloniza- tion. Researchers exploit differences in legal origin as exogenous determinants conﬁrms the main prediction of the legal origins view: countries with a com- mon law tradition have more developed ﬁnancial systems than those with a French civil law tradition (e.g., La Porta et al.

    "abstract": "Expectations about long-term earnings growth are crucial to valuation mod- els and cost of capital estimates. We analyze historical long-term growth rates across a broad cross section of stocks using several indicators of operating performance. We test for persistence and predictability in growth. While some firms have grown at high rates historically, they are relatively rare instances. There is no persistence in long-term earnings growth beyond chance, and there is low predictability even with a wide variety of predictor variables. Spe- cifically, Ibes growth forecasts are overly optimistic and add little predictive power. Valuation ratios also have limited ability to predict future growth. THE Expected Rate of growth in future cash flows (usually proxied by accounting earnings) plays a pivotal role in financial management and investment analysis. In the context of aggregate market valuation, for example, projections about fu- ture growth are instrumental in predicting the equity risk premium. Much cur- rent controversy surrounds the appropriate level of the equity risk premium, as well as whether recent market valuation levels (at least as of year-end 1999) can be justified (Asness (2000), Welch (2000), Fama and French (2002)).

    "abstract": "Firms’ inability to commit to future funding choices has profound consequences for capital structure dynamics. With debt in place, shareholders pervasively resist lever- holders would instead choose to increase leverage even if the new debt is junior and would reduce ﬁrm value. These asymmetric forces in leverage adjustments, which we call the leverage ratchet effect, cause equilibrium leverage outcomes to be history- dependent. If forced to reduce leverage, shareholders are biased toward selling assets relative to potentially more efﬁcient alternatives such as pure recapitalizations. IN This Paper , WE Show That THE Inability of ﬁrms to commit to future funding choices has profound and previously unexplored consequences for understand- ing capital structure outcomes and dynamics. Once debt is in place, sharehold- ers will resist any form of leverage reduction no matter how much the leverage reduction may increase total ﬁrm value. At the same time, shareholders would generally choose to increase leverage even if any new debt must be junior to existing debt.

    "title": "The Limits of Financial Globalization",
    "abstract": "Despite the dramatic reduction in explicit barriers to international investment activ- ity over the last 60 years, the impact of financial globalization has been surprisingly limited. I argue that country attributes are still critical to financial decision-making because of “twin agency problems” that arise because rulers of sovereign states and corporate insiders pursue their own interests at the expense of outside investors. When these twin agency problems are significant, diffuse ownership is inefficient and cor- porate insiders must co-invest with other investors, retaining substantial equity. The resulting ownership concentration limits economic growth, financial development, and the ability of a country to take advantage of financial globalization. AT THE END OF World WAR II, the financial markets of most countries were closed to cross-border trade in financial assets. Since then, many countries have sharply reduced such barriers. The liberalization of trade in financial assets is often called “financial globalization.” In neoclassical models, financial globalization generates major economic ben- efits. In particular, it enables investors worldwide to share risks better, it allows capital to flow where its productivity is highest, and it provides countries an opportunity to reap the benefits of their respective comparative advantages (see Stulz (1999a), for a review).

    "title": "The Limits of Investor Behavior",
    "abstract": "Many models use noise trader risk and corresponding violations of the Law of One Price to explain pricing anomalies, but include a storage technology in perfectly elas- tic supply or unlimited asset liability. Storage allows aggregate consumption risk to differ from exogenous fundamental risk, but using aggregate consumption as a factor for asset returns can make noise trader risk superfluous. Using (i) limited asset lia- bility and limited storage withdrawals, or (ii) an endogenous locally riskless interest rate eliminates violations of the Law of One Price. Our main results use only budget equations and market clearing, and require virtually no assumptions about behavior. THE Idea That Real -world Investors MAY NOT BE fully rational is an important influence on studies of modern asset pricing. Models of investor behavior natu- rally emphasize assumptions about investor rationality, but also embedded into these models are budget constraints, market clearing, the absence of single- period arbitrage opportunities, and assumptions about asset liability. We show that these features limit the impact of investor behavior on asset prices except in implausible circumstances. Common assumptions in the literature often thwart these limits and therefore yield misleading economic intuition. Thus, while in- vestor behavior can be important for asset pricing, it is important only in a manner different from that portrayed by models with these assumptions. We make this point by dissecting t",

Our empirical setting exploits a Supreme Court decision that strengthened parent limited liability protection for some subsidiaries. Using a difference-in-differences framework, we ﬁnd that stronger liability protection for parents leads to a 5% to 9% increase in toxic emissions by subsidiaries. Evidence suggests the increase in pollution is driven by lower investment in abatement tech- nologies rather than increased production. Cross-sectional tests suggest convexities associated with insolvency and executive compensation drive heterogeneous effects.

    "abstract": "We document the importance of covenant violations in transmitting bank health to nonﬁnancial ﬁrms. Roughly one-third of loans in our supervisory data breach a covenant during the 2008 to 2009 period, allowing lenders to force a renegotiation of loan terms or to accelerate repayment of otherwise long-term credit. Lenders in worse health are more likely to force a reduction in the loan commitment following a violation. The reduction in credit to borrowers who violate a covenant can account for the majority of the cross-sectional variation in credit supply during the 2008 to 2009 crisis. A Large Literature Documents That the health of the banking sector is important for nonﬁnancial ﬁrm outcomes such as investment and employ- ment.1 Most recently, the 2008 to 2009 period contained both a ﬁnancial crisis and the deepest recession in the United States in 60 years. Yet, at the start of the ﬁnancial panic in 2008, only 10% of bank loans had remaining maturity of less than one year and the typical ﬁrm did not face the prospect of a bank loan maturing until 2011.

    "abstract": "Reversal is the current stylized fact of weekly returns. However, we find that an opposing and long-lasting continuation in returns follows the well-documented brief reversal. These subsequent momentum profits are strong enough to offset the initial reversal and to produce a significant momentum effect over the full year following portfolio formation. Thus, ex post, extreme weekly returns are not too extreme. Our findings extend to weekly price movements with and without public news. In addi- tion, there is no relation between news uncertainty and the momentum in 1-week returns. Returns OF Individual Stocks reverse in the short run. Lehmann (1990) and Jegadeesh (1990) find that stocks with the lowest returns over the prior week or month outperform stocks with the highest returns over the prior period. Given these findings, the literature currently views extreme weekly returns as larger than those warranted by a stock’s fundamentals, due to overreaction and/or to microstructural issues. However, we find evidence suggesting that extreme weekly returns are not extreme enough: Despite the brief reversal documented weekly return are actually in the same direction as those in the extreme week. In other words, we find return momentum in a new and seemingly unexpected place—weekly returns. While prior studies examine the performance of stocks with extreme weekly returns for only a few weeks, which is the duration of the reversal, momentum profits emerge several weeks after an extreme",

    "abstract": "Using essentially all Moody’s bond ratings changes between 1970 and 1997, we find no reliable abnormal returns following upgrades. However, we find negative abnormal returns on the magnitude of 10 to 14 percent in the first year following downgrades. Additional results reveal that this underperformance is especially pro- nounced for small, low-credit-quality firms. Also, downgrades underperform in nearly all years in the sample, and a large part of the abnormal returns occur at sub- sequent earnings announcements. Thus, the evidence suggests that the poor re- turns result from an underreaction to the announcement of downgrades, rather than from lower systematic risk. A Number OF Recent Studies suggest that stock price reactions to various events are often incomplete. For example, Loughran and Ritter ~1995! And Spiess and Affleck-Graves ~1995! Find that equity issuers substantially under- perform for three to five years following the offering. Other examples in- clude Ikenberry, Lakonishok, and Vermaelen~1995!, who document abnormally high returns after share repurchases, and Ikenberry, Rankine, and Stice ~1996!, who find positive abnormal returns following stock splits. There are several reasons to believe that bond ratings changes offer another powerful and interesting setting for the investigation of long-run returns. First, bond ratings changes are common and well-disseminated information events. Sec- ically significant shifts in the firms’ economic conditions. For example",

We show that postannouncement abnormal re- turns are significantly positive for equally weighted calendar time portfolios, but become insignificant when the portfolios are value weighted. Moreover, the equally weighted results are not robust across subsamples. We also document postan- nouncement reductions in the risk factor loadings of underlying stocks. Cross- sectionally, these reductions are negatively related to the contemporaneous price drifts, suggesting the price drifts may be a sample-specific result of chance. Our results underscore the importance of testing for changes in risk loadings in future long-term event studies. AN Increasingly Important Issue in the study of financial markets is to under- stand the causes of the apparent abnormal equity price drifts or anomalies that are shown to follow various types of corporate events. In this paper, we address this issue within the context of dividend policy. We examine the long- term stock performance following the initiation and resumption of cash divi- dends during the period from 1927 to 1998. Although Michaely, Thaler, and Womack (1995) document a positive price drift for firms that initiate divi- dends during the 1964 to 1988 period, we can replicate their findings only for equally weighted portfolios and only for dividend events that occurred during the post-1964 period.

    "title": "The Macroeconomics of Shadow Banking",
    "abstract": "We build a macroﬁnance model of shadow banking—the transformation of risky as- sets into securities that are money-like in quiet times but become illiquid when uncer- tainty spikes. Shadow banking economizes on scarce collateral, expanding liquidity provision, boosting asset prices and growth, but also building up fragility. A rise in uncertainty raises shadow banking spreads, forcing ﬁnancial institutions to switch to collateral-intensive funding. Shadow banking collapses, liquidity provision shrinks, liquidity premia and discount rates rise, asset prices and investment fall. The model generates slow recoveries, collateral runs, and ﬂight-to-quality effects, and it sheds light on Large-Scale Asset Purchases, Operation Twist, and other interventions. Recent Economic Performance HAS BEENthe story of a boom, a bust, and a slow recovery. The rise and fall of shadow banking plays a central role in that story. In the boom years, shadow banking transformed risky loans into short-term money-like instruments held by households, ﬁrms, and institutional investors. These instruments traded at low spreads over traditional money-like instru- ments such as Treasury bills, indicating a high level of liquidity. This liquidity evaporated, however, with the onset of the ﬁnancial crisis, when spreads opened up and shadow banking all but shut down, causing both liquidity and credit to contract sharply.1 Shadow banking can thus be interpreted as fragile liquidity Nber.

    "title": "The Making of a Dealer Market:",
    "abstract": "This paper provides an analysis of the nature and evolution of a dealer market for Nasdaq stocks. Despite size differences in sample stocks, there is a surprising consistency to their trading. One dealer tends to dominate trading in a stock. Mar- kets are concentrated and spreads are increasing in the volume and market share of the dominant dealer. Entry and exit are ubiquitous. Exiting dealers are those with very low profits and trading volume. Entering market makers fail to capture a meaningful share of trading or profits. Thus, free entry does little to improve the competitive nature of the market as entering dealers have little impact. We find, however, that for small stocks, the Nasdaq dealer market is being more competi- tive than the specialist market. Dealer Markets ARE Widely Used for trading financial assets. In the United States, bonds and foreign exchange trade almost exclusively in dealer mar- kets, and equity trading on the Nasdaq dealer market, at least by some measures, is now greater than it is on the New York Stock Exchange (nyse). There are more listed securities on the Nasdaq market than on the Nyse, and there are more initial public offerings (IPOs).1 This latter fact reflects the particular importance that dealer markets have for smaller firms who, while occasionally switching to exchanges as mature firms, typically begin trading in a dealer setting.

    "title": "The Manipulation of Executive Stock Option",
    "abstract": "I identify three option exercise strategies executives engage in, including (i) exercising with cash and immediately selling the shares, (ii) exercising with cash and holding the shares, and (iii) delivering some shares to the company to cover the exercise costs and holding the remaining shares. Stock price patterns suggest executives manipulate option exercises. They use private information to increase the profitability of all three strategies, and likely backdated some exercise dates in the pre-Sarbanes-Oxley period to enhance the profitability of the latter two strategies, where the executive’s company is the only counterparty. Backdating is associated with reporting of internal control weaknesses. Previous Studies Have Considered whether executives time the exercise of op- tions that are granted as part of their compensation based on inside informa- tion. These studies often assume that executives immediately sell the stock acquired through option exercises, and that informed exercises would be re- flected in abnormally low subsequent stock returns. 1 Many of these studies uncover only weak evidence that executives use private information when ex- ercising options. However, a weakness of many of these studies is that they do not control for the various exercise strategies executives commonly engage in, and thus they do not account for the different ways executives might manipu- late these strategies to maximize their profitability.

A key feature of the model is that investors look at the frequency of past performance reversals to determine which regime currently governs performance.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a new method using option prices to estimate the market value of the shareholder voting rights associated with a stock. The method consists of synthesizing a nonvoting share using put-call parity, and comparing its price to that of the underlying stock. Empirically, we ﬁnd this measure of the value of voting rights to be positive and increasing in the time to expiration of synthetic stocks. The measure also increases around special shareholder meetings, periods of hedge fund activism, and M&A events. The method is likely useful in studies of corporate control and also has asset pricing implications.

    "abstract": "We present a model of the market for advice in which advisers have conﬂicts of interest and compete for heterogeneous customers through information provision. The com- petitive equilibrium features information dispersion and partial disclosure. Although conﬂicted fees lead to distorted information, they are irrelevant for customers’ welfare: banning conﬂicted fees improves only the information quality, not customers’ welfare. Instead, ﬁnancial literacy education for the least informed customers can improve all customers’ welfare because of a spillover effect. Furthermore, customers who trade through advisers realize lower average returns, which rationalizes empirical ﬁndings. Providing Advice IS AN Important function of intermediaries. The compensa- tion structure of intermediaries, however, often leads to conﬂicts of interest. For example, broker-dealer ﬁrms are compensated by commissions and fund distribution fees, and realtors receive fees only if they close a deal. Financial ad- vice has received considerable attention from academics and regulators alike. It is well documented that conﬂicted advice leads to lower investment returns, which imposes a substantial loss on households.1 As a result, many countries have started regulating adviser fees in an effort to eliminate conﬂicted advice.

    "title": "The Market for Corporate Assets:",
    "abstract": "We analyze the market for corporate assets. There is an active market for corpo- rate assets, with close to seven percent of plants changing ownership annually through mergers, acquisitions, and asset sales in peak expansion years. The prob- ability of asset sales and whole-firm transactions is related to firm organization and ex ante efficiency of buyers and sellers. The timing of sales and the pattern of efficiency gains suggests that the transactions that occur, especially through asset sales of plants and divisions, tend to improve the allocation of resources and are consistent with a simple neoclassical model of profit maximizing by firms. IN THE United States there is a large and active market for corporate assets, from individual plants and divisions up to sales of entire corporations. Each year over the period 1974 to 1992, an average 3.89 percent of the large manufacturing plants in the country changed ownership. 1 This average masks substantial procyclical time variation, so that in expansion years, an aver- age of 6.19 percent of manufacturing plants are involved in mergers and acquisitions and asset sales in each year. While the literature has succeeded in providing many insights about the gains and losses in mergers, mergers comprise only about one half of the total number of assets traded. 2 Much less is known about partial-firm asset sales. 3 ported by NSF Grant #SBR-9709427.

    "abstract": "We relate the property rights theory of the firm to empirical regularities in the mar- ket for mergers and acquisitions. We first show that high market-to-book acquirers typically do not purchase low market-to-book targets. Instead, mergers pair together firms with similar ratios. We then build a continuous-time model of investment and merger activity combining search, scarcity, and asset complementarity to explain this like buys like result. We test the model by relating like-buys-like to search frictions. Search frictions and assortative matching vary inversely, supporting the model over standard explanations. THE Boundaries OF THE Firm are constantly being drawn and redrawn in the market for corporate control. This activity surely reflects the importance of the placement of the boundaries of the firm, a topic that has received a great deal of attention in economic theory. The goal of this paper is to bridge the gap between the theory of the firm and empirical evidence on mergers, and demonstrate the significance of the theory of the firm for understanding empirical regularities in the market for mergers and acquisitions. One of the most well-established stylized facts about merger and acquisi- tion activity is that the typical merger involves an acquirer with high asset valuations purchasing a target with low asset valuations. This is commonly interpreted as evidence in favor of a “q-theory of mergers,” in which mergers involve redeploying the assets of underperforming tar",

    "title": "The Maturity Rat Race",
    "abstract": "Why do some ﬁrms, especially ﬁnancial institutions, ﬁnance themselves so short- term? We show that extreme reliance on short-term ﬁnancing may be the outcome of a maturity rat race: a borrower may have an incentive to shorten the maturity of an individual creditor’s debt contract because this dilutes other creditors. In response, other creditors opt for shorter maturity contracts as well. This dynamic toward short maturities is present whenever interim information is mostly about the probability of default rather than the recovery in default. For borrowers that cannot commit to a maturity structure, equilibrium ﬁnancing is inefﬁciently short-term. ONE OF THE Central lessons of the ﬁnancial crisis of 2007–2009 is the impor- tance of maturity structure for ﬁnancial stability: the crisis vividly exposed the vulnerability of institutions with strong maturity mismatch—those who ﬁnance themselves short-term and invest long-term—to disruptions in their funding liquidity. This raises the question of why ﬁrms and, in particular, ﬁ- nancial institutions, use so much short-term ﬁnancing, even if this exposes them to signiﬁcant rollover risk? In this paper, we argue that excessive reliance on short-term ﬁnancing may be the outcome of an inefﬁcient dynamic that we call thematurity rat race. To demonstrate this point, we develop a model of the equilibrium maturity structure for a borrower who borrows from multiple creditors to ﬁnance long- term investments. When this borrower cannot commit",

    "title": "The Media and the Diffusion of Information in",
    "abstract": "The media are increasingly recognized as key players in ﬁnancial markets. I inves- tigate their causal impact on trading and price formation by examining national newspaper strikes in several countries. Trading volume falls 12% on strike days. The dispersion of stock returns and their intraday volatility are reduced by 7%, while ag- gregate returns are unaffected. Moreover, analysis of return predictability indicates that newspapers propagate news from the previous day. These ﬁndings demonstrate that the media contribute to the efﬁciency of the stock market by improving the dissemination of information among investors and its incorporation into stock prices. HOW Traders Obtain Information IS of great importance to understanding ﬁ- nancial markets. This paper investigates the contribution of the media, if any, to trading activity and price formation. In textbook ﬁnancial markets, arbi- trage renders this contribution insigniﬁcant: public news is incorporated into asset prices quickly and fully, even before the media have time to report it. Yet, a large body of evidence suggests that public information diffuses gradually through the investor population and that this gradual diffusion affects prices.1 In this context, one may suspect the media matters for ﬁnancial markets. ∗Joel Peress is at Insead.

    "title": "The Misallocation of Finance",
    "abstract": "We estimate real losses arising from the cross-sectional misallocation of ﬁnancial liabilities. Extending a production-based framework of misallocation measurement to the liabilities side of the balance sheet and using manufacturing ﬁrm data from the United States and China, we ﬁnd signiﬁcant misallocation of debt and equity in China but not the United States. Reallocating liabilities of ﬁrms in China to mimic U.S. Efﬁciency would produce gains of 51% to 69% in real value-added, with only 17% to 21% stemming from inefﬁcient debt-equity combinations. For Chinese ﬁrms that are large or in developed cities, we estimate lower distortionary ﬁnancing costs. And macroeconomics has provided convincing evidence that cross-sectional misallocation of capital and labor is signiﬁcant and can help explain why de- veloping countries have lower total factor productivity (TFP).1 Such pervasive evidence of factor misallocation begs the question of whether the ﬁnancial lia- bilities that back the funding of capital goods and payroll are also misallocated. Are the right ﬁrms getting the right amount of ﬁnance, and is the mix of debt and equity optimal? In this paper, we tackle these two related questions, mov- ing from the asset side of the balance sheet to the liability side to quantify the extent of the misallocation of ﬁnance.

    "abstract": "I demonstrate that skill and scale are mismatched among actively managed equity mutual funds. Many mutual fund investors confuse the effects of fund exposures to common systematic factors with managerial skill when allocating capital among funds. Active mutual funds with positive factor-related past returns thus accumulate assets to the point that they signiﬁcantly underperform. I also show that the negative aggregate benchmark-adjusted performance of active equity mutual funds is driven mainly by these oversized funds. THE Extent TO Which AN actively managed mutual fund can add value for investors depends not only on the portfolio manager’s skill in discovering su- perior investment opportunities but also on the scale of the fund.

    "abstract": "All-cash homebuyers account for one-third of U.S. Home purchases between 1980 and gaged buyers pay an 11% premium over all-cash buyers to compensate home sellers for mortgage transaction frictions. A dynamic, representative-seller model implies only a 3% premium, which would suggest an 8% puzzle. Accounting for heterogeneity in selling conditions explains half of this difference, but a puzzle holds in conditions with high transaction risk. An experimental survey of U.S. Homeowners replicates these patterns and suggests that belief distortions can explain the puzzle in these high-risk states. Consider A Home Seller With Offers from two competing buyers: one is mortgage-ﬁnanced and the other is all-cash. Deﬁne the mortgage-cash premium as the expected difference in log prices between the two offers. In the absence of frictions, the mortgage-cash premium should be zero (Modigliani and Miller (1958)). More realistically , the premium should be positive to compensate sellers for frictions in the mortgage origination process, namely , the risk of transaction failure and a longer time to close.

    "abstract": "We study the recent Australian experience with yield curve control (YCC) as perhaps the best evidence of how this policy might work in other developed economies. YCC seemingly worked well in 2020, when the market expected short rates to stay at zero for a long period of time. As the global recovery and inﬂation gained momentum in 2021, liftoff expectations moved up, the Reserve Bank of Australia purchased most of the targeted government bond outstanding, and the target bond’s yield dislocated from other ﬁnancial market instruments. The evidence suggests that central bank bond purchase programs can operate more narrowly than previously considered. With Short -term Interest Rates AT THE effective lower bound during both the Great Recession and the Covid-19 recession, central banks around the world adopted policies of quantitative easing (QE), buying large quantities of government bonds or other similar assets to further ease ﬁnancial condi- tions. QE policies can be divided into those that buy a ﬁxed quantity of bonds and those that target, or cap, a particular yield. The latter are collectively known as yield curve control (YCC) policies. Since the mid-1980s, conventional monetary policy in most economies transitioned from targeting monetary (or reserve) aggregates to short-term interest rates. In contrast, nearly all QE pro- grams to date have speciﬁed ﬁxed quantities of purchases. An exception to this practice is the policy experiment by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA),",

    "abstract": "This paper provides a comprehensive examination of the disciplinary role of the cor- porate takeover market using a sample of U.S. Target firms over the period 1979 to 1998. The time period spanned allows a broader study not only of the disciplinary role of the takeover market in general, but also of the interaction between the takeover market and alternative governance mechanisms during the 1980s and 1990s. Overall, our evidence is consistent with the view of the corporate takeover market as a “court of last resort,” that is, it is an external source of discipline that intercedes when internal control mechanisms are relatively weak or ineffective. Financial Economists Generally Agree With the proposition that takeovers occur in part to replace managers who are not maximizing shareholder wealth (see, e.g., Jensen (1988), Scharfstein (1988), and Weisbach (1993)). Using a sample of 279 successful corporate takeovers of U.S. Targets accomplished through tender offers, this paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the disciplinary role of the takeover market over a recent 20-year period, 1979 to 1998. The distinctive feature of this study is that we explicitly recognize the interaction between the corporate takeover market and alternative control mechanisms while analyzing the impact of the evolving corporate governance environment on the intensity of takeover-related discipline.

    "abstract": "I estimate the market’s valuation of the net beneﬁts to leverage using panel data from 1994 to 2004, identiﬁed from market values and betas of a company’s debt and equity. The median ﬁrm captures net beneﬁts of up to 5.5% of ﬁrm value. Small and proﬁtable ﬁrms have high optimal leverage ratios, as predicted by theory, but in contrast to existing empirical evidence. Companies are on average slightly underlevered relative to the optimal leverage ratio at reﬁnancing. This result is mainly due to zero leverage ﬁrms. I also look at implications for ﬁnancial policy. Theories OF Optimal capital structure typically explain companies’ choice of debt versus equity ﬁnancing by a trade-off: ﬁrms choose a leverage ratio that optimally weighs the beneﬁts of debt such as interest tax shields (Kraus and Litzenberger (1973)) and agency beneﬁts due to reductions in free cash ﬂow (Jensen (1986)) against the costs of debt, which include the direct costs of bankruptcy (Warner (1977) and Weiss (1990)) as well as indirect costs such as debt overhang (Myers (1977)), asset substitution (Jensen and Meckling (1976)), and asset ﬁre-sales (Shleifer and Vishny (1992)). The literature tests this trade- off by running cross-sectional regressions of leverage on a set of variables that proxy for the beneﬁts and costs (see Harris and Raviv (1991) for an overview, and recent work such as Rajan and Zingales (2003) and Frank and Goyal (2004)). A shortcoming of the regression approach is that it is not possible to",

    "title": "The New Game in Town: Competitive Effects",
    "abstract": "We analyze the effect of initial public offerings (IPOs) on industry competitors and provide evidence that companies experience negative stock price reactions to com- pleted IPOs in their industry and positive stock price reactions to their withdrawal. Following a successful IPO in their industry, they show signiﬁcant deterioration in their operating performance. These results are consistent with the existence of IPO- related competitive advantages through the loosening of ﬁnancial constraints, ﬁnan- cial intermediary certiﬁcation, and the presence of knowledge capital. These aspects of competitiveness are signiﬁcant in explaining the cross-section of underperformance as well as survival probabilities for competing ﬁrms. AN Extensive Literature analyzes the performance of companies around their initial public offerings (IPOs). This literature focuses on returns on the ﬁrst day of trading, as well as on returns and operating performance for the 5-year period after the IPO. For example, Ibbotson and Jaffe (1975) document a positive initial return for newly issued companies, while Ritter (1991) analyzes the long- run stock price performance of IPOs and Jain and Kini (1994) consider ﬁrms’ post-IPO operating performance. Our article adds a new dimension to this literature by considering not only the stock market and operating performance of the issuing company, but also the impact of the IPO on the performance of industry competitors. The competitive effects of IPOs have important",

    "title": "The Optimal Concentration of Creditors",
    "abstract": "Our model assumes that creditors need to expend resources to collect on claims. Conse- quently, because diffuse creditors suffer from mutual free-riding (Holmstrom (1982)), they fare worse than concentrated creditors (e.g., a house bank). The model predicts that measures of debt concentration relate positively to creditors’ (aggregate) debt collection expenditures and positively to management’s chosen expenditures to resist paying. However, collection activity is purely redistributive, so social waste is larger when creditors are concentrated. If borrower quality is not known, the best firms choose the most concentrated creditors and pay higher expected yields. Coordination Failure Among Multiple Claimants ,b ethey creditors or owners, is a subject well studied in the academic literature. Such coordination fail- ure can lead to takeover failures (Grossman and Hart (1980)) or bank-runs (e.g., Diamond and Dybvig (1983), Morris and Shin (1999)), or can generally reduce the probability of successful renegotiation to a proposed reorganization plan when renegotiation requires simultaneous assent by many claimants (e.g., Bergl¨of, Roland, and van Thadden (2000)). In many of these models, the coor- dination failure aids the dispersed claimants—multiple claimants’ cooperation is only purchased with an offer that is attractive enough for each and every claimant to choose to collaborate. Thus, coordination failure can suggest that dispersed creditors or owners can receive higher settlem",

    "title": "The Optimal Size of Hedge Funds: Conﬂict",
    "abstract": "This study examines whether the standard compensation contract in the hedge fund industry aligns managers’ incentives with investors’ interests. I show empirically that managers’ compensation increases when fund assets grow, even when diseconomies of scale in fund performance exist. Thus, managers’ compensation is maximized at a much larger fund size than is optimal for fund performance. However, to avoid capital outﬂows, managers are also motivated to restrict fund growth to maintain style- average performance. Similarly, fund management ﬁrms have incentives to collect more capital for all funds under management, including their ﬂagship funds, even at the expense of fund performance. ONE OF THE Important Ways in which hedge funds differ from traditional in- vestment vehicles is in the design of managers’ compensation contracts. A key difference is that, in contrast to their peers in the mutual fund industry, hedge fund managers charge an additional performance-based incentive fee. The in- centive fee allows hedge fund managers to charge part of fund proﬁts as their compensation and is intended to motivate them to maximize fund performance. However, evidence on the extent to which the standard compensation con- tract of hedge funds aligns managers’ incentives with investors’ best interests is mixed. Like other investment vehicles, such as mutual funds, hedge funds are likely to suffer from diseconomies of scale. Limited investment opportunities, potential negative price impac",

    "title": "The Paradox of Financial Fire Sales: The Role",
    "abstract": "How can ﬁre sales for ﬁnancial assets happen when the economy contains well- capitalized but nonspecialist investors? Our explanation combines rational expec- tations equilibrium and “lemons” models. When specialist (informed) market par- ticipants are liquidity-constrained, prices become less informative. This creates an adverse selection problem, decreasing the supply of high-quality assets, and lowering valuations by nonspecialist (uninformed) investors, who become unwilling to sup- ply capital to support the price. In normal times, arbitrage capital can “multiply” itself by making uninformed capital function as informed capital, but in a crisis, this stabilizing mechanism fails. IN A Fire Sale, Sellers ARE Forced TO SELLassets at deep discounts because no one is willing to buy them at fair prices. Sellers can be forced to sell because of ﬁnancial distress, credit market frictions, regulation, margin calls, etc.1 Why do ﬁre sales happen? What makes investors avoid buying assets that are apparently cheap? One explanation is offered by Shleifer and Vishny (1992): if industry experts with higher private valuations do not have enough liquidity, assets are bought at a discount by nonexperts who cannot use them efﬁciently. This argument applies naturally to real assets rather than ﬁnancial securities. But since ﬁnancial securities typically require that the holder only collects cash ﬂows, not operates the assets, there should not be signiﬁcant differences in private valuations.2",

The overlap of funds whose managers reside in the same neighborhood is considerably higher than that of funds whose managers live in the same city but in different neigh- borhoods. These effects are larger when managers share a similar ethnic background, and are not explained by preferences. Valuable information is transmitted through these peer networks: a long-short strategy composed of stocks purchased minus sold by neighboring managers delivers positive risk-adjusted returns.

We show experimentally that investors understand differences in dependence, but not in terms of correlation. Participants invest as if applying a simple counting heuristic for the frequency of comovement. They diversify more when the frequency of comovement is lower even if correlation is higher due to dependence in the tails.

    "abstract": "Financial regulation was as hotly debated a political issue in the 19th century as it is today. We study the political economy of state usury laws in 19th century America. Exploiting the wide variation in regulation, enforcement, and economic conditions across states and time, we ﬁnd that usury laws when binding reduce credit and economic activity, especially for smaller ﬁrms. We examine the motives of regulation and ﬁnd that usury laws coincide with other economic and political policies favoring wealthy political incumbents, particularly when they have more voting power. The evidence suggests ﬁnancial regulation is driven by private interests capturing rents from others rather than public interests protecting the underserved. WE Examine THE MOTIVESand consequences of ﬁnancial regulation to better un- derstand the implications of regulation for ﬁnancial development and economic growth. While the current global ﬁnancial crisis has reinvigorated the debate on ﬁnancial regulation’s effects and motives, there is a long history of ﬁnancial regulation and development we can examine to shed light on these issues. Speciﬁcally, we study the political economy of ﬁnancial regulation and its consequences through the lens of usury laws in 19th century America.

    "abstract": "Incumbents in various industries have different incentives to promote or oppose fi- nancial development. Changes in the relative strength of promoter and opponent industries thus result in changes in the political equilibrium level of financial devel- opment. We conduct an event study using a sample of 41 countries that liberalized trade during 1970 to 2000, and show that the strengthening of promoter relative to opponent industries resulting from liberalization is a good predictor of subsequent fi- nancial development. The benefits of developing the financial system are insufficient for financial development, and rents in particular hands appear to be necessary to achieve it. IT HAS Been Extensively Documented that the level of financial development varies greatly across countries (LaPorta et al. (1997), (1998)). Existing theo- ries that try to explain these differences tend to rely on stable, largely prede- termined factors such as a country’s legal origin (in the line of LaPorta et al. (1997), (1998)), pattern of colonization (Acemoglu and Johnson (2003)), reli- gion and culture (Stulz and Williamson (2003)), and social capital endowment (Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales (2004)). Less documented, however, is the fact that a country’s financial development exhibits nontrivial changes over time that rival its cross-sectional variation.

    "abstract": "The U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee considered many important banking reforms in 2009 to 2010. We show that, during this period, fore- closure starts on delinquent mortgages were delayed in the districts of committee members although there was no difference in delinquency rates between committee and noncommittee districts. In these areas, banks delayed the foreclosure starts by 0.5 months (relative to the 12-month average). The estimated cost of delay to lenders is an order of magnitude greater than the campaign contributions by the political action committees of the largest mortgage servicing banks to the committee members in that period. THE Financial Crisis OF 2008 led to a sharp rise in foreclosures. As a highly visible symbol of the crisis, foreclosures attracted considerable attention from politicians, regulators, and the public. In particular, large banks—many of which also service securitized mortgages—and their foreclosure practices faced public scrutiny. For example, during a congressional hearing on February 10, 2009, Barney Frank, then-Chairman of the Financial Services Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives (hfsc), called for a moratorium on new foreclosure starts. 1 Within days, at least one very large bank agreed to Singleton (Editor); two referees; Gadi Barlevy; Jeff Campbell; Artyom Durnev (WFA discussant); Jeffrey Frieden (nber discussant) Luojia Hu; Brian Knight (nber discussant); Chris Mayer; Brian Melzer (firs discussant",

A long-short portfolio constructed from ﬁrms with high versus low toxic emission intensity within an industry generates an average annual return of 4.42%, which remains signiﬁcant after controlling for risk factors. This pollution premium cannot be explained by ex- isting systematic risks, investor preferences, market sentiment, political connections, or corporate governance.

    "abstract": "The disposition effect for a stock signiﬁcantly weakens if the portfolio is at a gain, but is large when it is at a loss. We ﬁnd this portfolio-driven disposition effect (pdde) in four independent settings: U.S. And Chinese archival data, as well as U.S. And Chinese experiments. The Pdde is robust to a variety of controls in regression speciﬁcations and is not explained by extreme returns, portfolio rebalancing, tax considerations, or investor heterogeneity. Our evidence suggests that investors form mental frames at both the stock and the portfolio levels and that these frames com- bine to generate the Pdde. There IS Perhaps NO More robust trading phenomenon than the disposition effect, the pattern whereby investors are more likely to sell an asset when it is at a gain than when it is at a loss (Shefrin and Statman (1985)). The dispo- sition effect has been documented among U.S. Retail investors (Odean (1998)), foreign retail investors (Frydman and Wang (2020), Grinblatt and Keloharju (2001)), institutional investors (Shapira and Venezia (2001)), homeowners (Genesove and Mayer (2001)), and corporate executives (Heath, Huddart, and Florida.

These pre-FOMC returns have increased over time and account for sizable fractions of total annual realized stock returns. While other major international equity indices experienced similar pre-FOMC returns, we ﬁnd no such effect in U.S. Treasury securities and money market futures. Other major U.S. Macroeconomic news announcements also do not give rise to preannouncement excess equity returns. We discuss challenges in explaining these returns with standard asset pricing theory. IN THE Past FEW decades stocks in the United States and several other major economies have experienced large excess returns in anticipation of U.S. Mon- etary policy decisions made at scheduled policy meetings. This phenomenon, which we refer to as the pre-FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) an- nouncement drift, is difﬁcult to explain with standard asset pricing theory. Members of the FOMC—the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy-making body—regularly convene at scheduled meetings to make monetary policy deci- sions.

    "abstract": "The excess return in the stock market is higher under Democratic than Repub- lican presidencies: 9 percent for the value-weighted and 16 percent for the equal-weighted portfolio. The difference comes from higher real stock returns and lower real interest rates, is statistically significant, and is robust in sub- samples. The difference in returns is not explained by business-cycle variables related to expected returns, and is not concentrated around election dates. There is no difference in the riskiness of the stock market across presidencies that could justify a risk premium. The difference in returns through the political cycle is therefore a puzzle. IN THE Run-up Toall Presidential Elections, the popular press is awash with reports about whether Republicans or Democrats are better for the stock market. Unfor- paper fills that gap by conducting a careful empirical analysis of the relation between presidential elections and the stock market. Using data since 1927, we find that the average excess return of the value- weighted Crsp index over the three-month Treasury bill rate has been about 2 percent under Republican and 11 percent under Democratic presidents-a strik- ing difference of 9 percent per year! This difference is economically and statisti- cally significant.

    "abstract": "Milton Friedman argued that irrational traders will consistently lose money, will not survive, and, therefore, cannot influence long-run asset prices. Since his work, sur- vival and price impact have been assumed to be the same. In this paper, we demon- strate that survival and price impact are two independent concepts. The price impact of irrational traders does not rely on their long-run survival, and they can have a significant impact on asset prices even when their wealth becomes negligible. We also show that irrational traders’ portfolio policies can deviate from their limits long after the price process approaches its long-run limit. Most Neoclassical Asset Pricing Models Rely on the assumption that market participants (traders) are rational in the sense that they behave in ways that are consistent with the objective probabilities of the states of the economy (e.g., Radner (1972) and Lucas (1978)). In particular, they maximize expected utili- ties using the true probabilities of uncertain economic states. This approach is firmly rooted in the tradition of going from the normative to the positive in eco- nomics, yet there is mounting evidence that it is not descriptive of the observed behavior of the average market participant (see, e. G., Alpert and Raiffa (1982), Benartzi and Thaler (2001), Black (1986), Kahneman and Tversky (1979), and Odean (1998)).

In contrast, we adopt the perspective of a buy-and-hold investor and examine stock price levels. For such an investor, the price level is more relevant than the short-horizon expected return, and betas of cash flow fundamentals are more important than high-frequency stock return betas.

The joint hypothesis of the capital asset pricing model (capm, Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1965)) and market efficiency is typically rejected by these tests.

    "title": "The Price Response to S&P 500 Index Additions",
    "abstract": "We study the price effects of changes to the S&P 500 index and document an asym- metric price response: There is a permanent increase in the price of added firms but no permanent decline for deleted firms. These results are at odds with extant ex- planations of the effects of index changes that imply a symmetric price response to additions and deletions. A possible explanation for asymmetric price effects arises from the changes in investor awareness. Results from our empirical tests support the thesis that changes in investor awareness contribute to the asymmetric price effects of S&P 500 index additions and deletions. THE Long-held Assumption that stocks have perfect substitutes, and the perfect elasticity of demand that follows from it, is central to modern finance theory. If securities have (almost) perfectly elastic demand, then any supply or demand shocks that are devoid of information should have no effect on the prevailing of new information focused on block trades, equity issues, and stock splits, but was unable to exclude information effects around these events. Since there is no obvious reason to believe, ex ante, that index changes con- tain new information, they constitute a natural framework for testing whether stocks have almost perfectly elastic or horizontal demand curves. A stock’s ex- cess return around such changes could be consistent with a downward sloping demand curve. With the advent of indexed mutual funds in 1976, and the public announcement of S&P i",

    "title": "The Price of Correlation Risk: Evidence",
    "abstract": "We study whether exposure to marketwide correlation shocks affects expected option returns, using data on S&P100 index options, options on all components, and stock returns. We find evidence of priced correlation risk based on prices of index and indi- vidual variance risk. A trading strategy exploiting priced correlation risk generates a high alpha and is attractive for Crra investors without frictions. Correlation risk exposure explains the cross-section of index and individual option returns well. The correlation risk premium cannot be exploited with realistic trading frictions, provid- ing a limits-to-arbitrage interpretation of our finding of a high price of correlation risk. Correlations Play A Central Role in financial markets. There is considerable ev- idence that correlations between asset returns change over time1 and that stock return correlations increase when returns are low.2 A marketwide increase in correlations negatively affects investor welfare by lowering diversification ben- efits and by increasing market volatility, so that states of nature with unusually high correlations may be expensive. It is therefore natural to ask whether mar- ketwide correlation risk is priced in the sense that assets that pay off well when marketwide correlations are higher than expected (thereby providing a like to thank Yacine A¨ıt-Sahalia, David Bates, Jonathan Berk, Oleg Bondarenko, Michael Brandt, Menachem Brenner, John Campbell, Mike Chernov, Greg Duffee, Darrell Duffie, Ro",

Our calibrated model replicates consumption, dividends, and asset market data, including VIX futures returns, the average im- plied volatilities in SPX and VIX options, and ﬁrst- and higher-order moments of VIX options returns. We document a time variation in the shape of VIX-option-implied volatility and a time-varying hedging relationship between VIX and SPX options that our model both captures. Since Their Introduction IN 2006, options on the VIX index have become the second-most traded contracts on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (cboe), surpassed only by S&P 500 (SPX) options. 1 The trading volume in VIX calls is about twice that of puts, reﬂecting a demand for speculative bets on, or hedges against, market turmoil in the form of high volatility. In this respect, VIX calls inherit some of the characteristics of out-of-the-money SPX put options, but with some important differences. We investigate the differ- ences in the pricing of SPX and VIX options in this paper with a primary view toward understanding the factors that drive differences in the pricing of these two types of catastrophe insurance contracts.

    "title": "The Price of Immediacy",
    "abstract": "This paper models transaction costs as the rents that a monopolistic market maker extracts from impatient investors who trade via limit orders. We show that limit orders are American options. The limit prices inducing immediate execution of the order are functionally equivalent to bid and ask prices and can be solved for various transaction sizes to characterize the market maker’s entire supply curve. We find considerable empirical support for the model’s predictions in the cross-section of Nyse firms. The model produces unbiased, out-of-sample forecasts of abnormal returns for firms added to the S&P 500 index. Capital Market Transactions essentially bundle a primary transaction for the underlying security with a secondary transaction for immediacy. From this perspective, the price of immediacy explains the wedge between transaction prices and fundamental value and therefore represents a cost of transacting. Despite widespread interest among investors and corporations alike, a useful characterization of transaction prices has been elusive. This paper addresses this challenge by developing a parsimonious model of the market for immediacy in capital market transactions that yields an analytically tractable quantity structure of immediacy prices. An inherent friction that limits liquidity in capital markets is the asyn- chronous arrival of buyers and sellers, each demanding relatively quick trans- actions. Grossman and Miller (1988) argue that the demand for immediacy in capital",

    "title": "The Price of Political Uncertainty: Theory and",
    "abstract": "We empirically analyze the pricing of political uncertainty, guided by a theoretical model of government policy choice. To isolate political uncertainty, we exploit its vari- ation around national elections and global summits. We ﬁnd that political uncertainty is priced in the equity option market as predicted by theory. Options whose lives span political events tend to be more expensive. Such options provide valuable protection against the price, variance, and tail risks associated with political events. This pro- tection is more valuable in a weaker economy and amid higher political uncertainty. The effects of political uncertainty spill over across countries. Political Uncertainty HAS Featured PROMINENTLYin the economic landscape of recent years. In the United States, much uncertainty surrounded the gov- ernment bailouts during the ﬁnancial crisis of 2008, the reforms of ﬁnance and health care, the Federal Reserve’s innovative monetary policy, tax policy, as well as the political brinkmanship over the debt ceiling in 2011 and 2013. Standard & Poor’s named political uncertainty as a key reason for its ﬁrst- ever downgrade of the U.S. Treasury debt in 2011. In Europe, the sovereign debt crisis has witnessed tremendous uncertainty about the actions of Euro- pean politicians, central bankers, and Greek voters. Alas, despite the salience of political uncertainty, our understanding of its effects on the economy and ﬁnancial markets is only beginning to emerge. And Veronesi are a",

    "title": "The Private Production of Safe Assets",
    "abstract": "Using high-frequency, granular panel data on short-term debt securities issued in Europe, we study the existence, empirical boundaries, and fragility of private assets’ safety. We show that only securities with the shortest maturities, issued by banks (certiﬁcates of deposit, or CDs), beneﬁt from a safety premium. The supply of such CDs responds positively to excess safety demand. During periods of stress, this re- lation vanishes for all issuers of private securities, even though their aggregate vol- umes do not collapse. Other dimensions of heterogeneity, including issuers’ balance sheets or their domicile countries’ ﬁscal capacity, are less relevant for private safety. A Safe Asset IS AN Asset That IS Immune to adverse selection concerns and thus can be valued without expensive and prolonged analysis (Gorton ( 2017)). Such an asset, for example, a Treasury, has money-like attributes and can serve as a store of value (Nagel ( 2016)). Traditionally, government debt has been the dominant type of safe asset (Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2012)). Recent decades, however, have been characterized by their apparent shortage. One potential explanation is that due to booming savings in emerg- ing economies, the demand for public safe assets increased faster than its sup- ply, pushing real interest rates to historically low levels, and creating global imbalances (Caballero ( 2006), Caballero, Farhi, and Gourinchas ( 2016, 2017), Caballero and Farhi ( 2018)).

    "title": "The Quality of ECN and Nasdaq",
    "abstract": "This paper compares the quality of quotes submitted by electronic communication networks (ECNs) and by traditional market makers to the Nasdaq quote montage. An analysis of the most active Nasdaq stocks shows that ECNs not only post in- formative quotes, but also, compared to market makers, ECNs post quotes rapidly and are more often at the inside. Additionally, ECN quoted spreads are smaller than dealer quoted spreads. The evidence suggests that the proliferation of alter- native trading venues, such as ECNs, may promote quote quality rather than frag- menting markets. Moreover, the results suggest that a more open book contributes to quote quality. This Paper Examines THE Quality of quotes posted by electronic communication networks (ECNs) and by Nasdaq market makers for actively traded Nasdaq stocks. An important dimension of quote quality is price leadership, or price discovery, which is accomplished by timely submission of informative quotes. An informative quote reflects an asset's unobservable full-information value or fundamental value. Full-information value is distinct from the observable price, which can be decomposed into two components, one reflecting full- information value and one reflecting transitory effects. The latter consists of price movements due to the bid-ask bounce, temporary order imbalances, inventory adjustments, and rounding effects. A study of the quality of ECN and Nasdaq market maker quotes is impor- tant because there are important differences",

    "abstract": "We examine the expiration of the IPO quiet period, which occurs after the 25th calendar day following the offering. For IPOs during 1996 to 2000, we find that analyst coverage is initiated immediately for 76 percent of these firms, almost always with a favorable rating. Initiated firms experience a five-day abnormal return of 4.1 percent versus 0.1 percent for firms with no coverage. The abnor- mal returns are concentrated in the days just before the quiet period expires. Abnormal returns are much larger when coverage is initiated by multiple ana- lysts. It does not matter whether a recommendation comes from the lead un- derwriter or not. Companies Participating in an initial public offering (IPO) face numerous regula- tory restrictions that prohibit certain activities while the company is \"in regis- tration\"After completion of an IPO, a firm is still considered to be in registration for an additional period of time. During this time, 25 days during our sample period which is termed the post-IPO \"quiet\" period, firms may make statements of fact regarding business developments and may respond to inquiries from analysts and shareholders regarding factual matters. However, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations generally prohibit firms and their underwriters from publishing opinions concerning valuation and from making forward-looking statements regarding earnings, revenues, and similar items.

    "title": "The Real Determinants of Asset Sales",
    "abstract": "I develop a dynamic structural model in which a firm makes rational decisions to buy or sell assets in the presence of productivity shocks. By identifying equilibrium asset prices, the model also examines the aggregate asset sales activity over the business cycle. It shows that changes in productivity, rather than productivity levels, affect decisions: Firms with rising productivity buy assets and firms with falling productivity downsize (“rising buys falling”). As such, industries in which firms have less persistent and more volatile productivity experience greater asset reallocation. Using plant-level predictions. ONE OF THE Puzzles IN Corporate Finance is why asset sales and merger activities vary not only across industries, but also over time. Many researchers find sim- ilar results: Assets are traded much more frequently in some industries than others, and a greater number of transactions occur in expansion years when aggregate productivity is high. But, what makes assets in one industry more likely to change hands than assets in others? Why do asset purchases and sales coincide with business cycles? Which firms engage in those transactions? This paper addresses these questions by providing a unified framework that jointly analyzes firms’ decisions to buy or sell assets and the activity of as- set reallocation in the industry. In the model, firms experience both firm- and industry-level productivity shocks, and they maximize value by making two interrelated decisions: ho",

    "abstract": "We show that sovereign debt impairments can have a signiﬁcant effect on ﬁnancial markets and real economies through a credit ratings channel. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd that ﬁrms reduce their investment and reliance on credit markets due to a rising cost of debt capital following a sovereign rating downgrade. We identify these effects by exploiting exogenous variation in corporate ratings due to rating agencies’ sovereign ceiling policies, which require that ﬁrms’ ratings remain at or below the sovereign rating of their country of domicile. Sovereign Debt IMPAIRMENTShave become a signiﬁcant problem for developed countries in the aftermath of the 2007 to 2009 global ﬁnancial crisis and the European sovereign debt crisis.

    "abstract": "Using mutual fund redemptions as an instrument for price changes, we identify a strong effect of market prices on takeover activity (the “trigger effect”). An interquar- tile decrease in valuation leads to a seven percentage point increase in acquisition likelihood, relative to a 6% unconditional takeover probability. Instrumentation ad- dresses the fact that prices are endogenous and increase in anticipation of a takeover (the “anticipation effect”). Our results overturn prior literature that ﬁnds a weak relation between prices and takeovers without instrumentation. These ﬁndings im- ply that ﬁnancial markets have real effects: They impose discipline on managers by triggering takeover threats. Does A LOW Market valuation make a ﬁrm a takeover target? In theory, if acqui- sition prices are related to market prices, acquirers can proﬁt from taking over a ﬁrm whose market value is low relative to its peers—due either to mispricing or mismanagement—and restore it to its potential. Indeed, in practice, acquirers and other investors appear to track a ﬁrm’s valuation multiples for indications on the potential for acquisition, and managers strive to maintain high market valuations to prevent a hostile takeover. Understanding whether such a link exists is important because, if so, this would suggest that the market is not a sideshow, but rather exerts a powerful disciplinary effect on ﬁrm management (as suggested by Marris (1964), Manne (1965),a n dJensen (1993)).

We hypothesize that a decrease in analyst coverage increases informa- tion asymmetry and thus increases the cost of capital; as a result, ﬁrms decrease their investment and ﬁnancing. We use broker closures and broker mergers to iden- tify changes in analyst coverage that are exogenous to corporate policies. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we ﬁnd that ﬁrms that lose an analyst decrease their investment and ﬁnancing by 1.9% and 2.0% of total assets, respectively, com- pared to similar ﬁrms that do not lose an analyst. IT IS Well Known that the global ﬁnancial crisis of the late 2000s caused the worst economic contraction since the 1930s. As a result, there has been a surge of interest in the real effects of ﬁnancial shocks (for example, see the survey paper by Bond, Edmans, and Goldstein (2012 )). In this paper, we study the effects on corporate policies of one particular ﬁnancial shock: a decrease in analyst coverage. We examine the effect of analyst coverage on corporate policies using two natural experiments, namely, broker closures as in Kelly and Ljungqvist (2012 ) and broker mergers as in Hong and Kacperczyk ( 2010). Both broker closures and broker mergers cause analysts to be terminated and analyst coverage to decrease for the ﬁrms previously covered by these analysts.

    "abstract": "Using plant-level data for Brazilian manufacturing ﬁrms, this paper provides evi- dence that government control over banks leads to signiﬁcant political inﬂuence over the real decisions of ﬁrms. I ﬁnd that ﬁrms eligible for government bank lending expand employment in politically attractive regions near elections. These expansions are associated with additional (favorable) borrowing from government banks. Fur- ther, these persistent expansions take place just before competitive elections, and are associated with lower future employment growth by ﬁrms in other regions. The anal- ysis suggests that politicians in Brazil use bank lending to shift employment towards politically attractive regions and away from unattractive regions. Government Ownership OF banks is widespread around the world (La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer (2002)). Given the role of banks as a major source of external ﬁnance for ﬁrms, it is important to understand the consequences of government control over their lending decisions. Recent work provides support for the idea that political considerations inﬂuence the lending decisions of government banks (Sapienza (2004), Dinc (2005), Khwaja and Mian (2006), Claessens, Feijen, and Laeven (2008), and Cole (2009)), but the literature has little to say about the real consequences of these considerations.

    "abstract": "This paper provides new evidence on the impact of access to ﬁnance on poverty . It highlights an important channel through which access affects poverty—the labor market. The paper exploits the opening of Banco Azteca in Mexico, a unique “natural experiment” in which over 800 bank branches opened almost simultaneously in pre- existing Elektra stores. Importantly , the bank has focused on previously underserved low-income clients. Our key ﬁnding is a sizeable effect of access to ﬁnance on labor market activity and income levels, especially among low-income individuals and those located in areas with lower preexisting bank penetration. IT IS Well Recognized that ﬁnancial development is important for economic growth (Levine (2005)). Several recent papers also ﬁnd a positive correlation between access to ﬁnance and poverty alleviation at the country level (Honohan (2004), Beck, Demirguc-Kunt, and Levine (2007), Demirguc-kunt, Beck, and Honohan (2008)). However, these papers tend to face identiﬁcation issues, and thus they do not necessarily establish a causal relationship between access to ﬁnance and economic outcomes. Similarly , while the microﬁnance industry has grown exponentially in the past few decades and many researchers have written on the topic, 1 there is little systematic evidence on the casual impact of microﬁnance on economic activity (Karlan and Morduch (2009)).2 This paper’s ﬁrst objective is to ﬁll this gap by providing new evidence on the impact of access to ﬁnan",

    "title": "The Real Product Market Impact of Mergers",
    "abstract": "I document sources of value creation in mergers by analyzing novel data on the quality and price of goods sold by merging ﬁrms. When two competitors in a product market merge, their products converge in quality, and prices fall relative to the competition. These effects take two to three years to be fully realized and are stronger in mature industries. Prices do not fall, however, when the acquirer is diversifying into a new product market. This direct evidence of real changes induced by merger activity is con- sistent with consolidation by related merging ﬁrms to achieve operational efﬁciencies and lower costs. WHY DO Firms Merge, and what happens when they do? Synergies enable two ﬁrms to increase their combined value when brought together and are com- monly cited as motivation for pursuing acquisition activity. Existing studies suggest that mergers do create value. Betton, Eckbo, and Thorburn (2008)s u r - vey the literature and conclude that the combined announcement effect for bidders and targets is positive. Operating performance also appears to im- prove post-merger (Healy, Palepu, and Ruback (1992), Andrade, Mitchell, and Stafford (2001)). The empirical literature has struggled, however, to identify the sources of this value creation. The challenge is that traditional data sets are too coarse. Market power or new product introductions can increase revenues, while plant or supplier consolidation can lower costs. But stock market reactions and ac- counting performance c",

    "abstract": "We study the implications of hedging for corporate ﬁnancing and investment. We do so using an extensive, hand-collected data set on corporate hedging activities. Hedging can lower the odds of negative realizations, thereby reducing the expected costs of ﬁnancial distress. In theory, this should ease a ﬁrm’s access to credit. Us- ing a tax-based instrumental variable approach, we show that hedgers pay lower interest spreads and are less likely to have capital expenditure restrictions in their loan agreements. These favorable ﬁnancing terms, in turn, allow hedgers to invest more. Our tests characterize two exact channels—cost of borrowing and investment restrictions—through which hedging affects corporate outcomes. The analysis shows that hedging has a ﬁrst-order effect on ﬁrm ﬁnancing and investment, and provides new insights into how hedging affects corporate value. More broadly, our study con- tributes novel evidence on the real consequences of ﬁnancial contracting. Active Corporate Risk MANAGEMENTwould be irrelevant in a Modigliani–Miller world of perfect capital markets. Yet, risk management through ﬁnancial hedg- ing has become increasingly important in recent years.

    "abstract": "Financial economists have intensely debated the performance of IPOs using data after the formation of Nasdaq. This paper sheds light on this controversy by undertaking a large, out-of-sample study: We examine the performance for five years after listing of 3,661 U.S. IPOs from 1935 to 1972. The sample displays some underperformance when event-time buy-and-hold abnormal returns are used. The underperformance disappears, however, when cumulative abnormal returns are utilized. A calendar-time analysis shows that over the entire peri- od, IPOs return as much as the market. The intercepts in Capm and Fama- French regressions are insignificantly different from zero, suggesting no ab- normal performance. Ritter (1991) AND Loughran AND Ritter (1995) document severe underperformance of initial public offerings (IPOs) during the past 20 years. In discussing these results, they suggest that investors may systematically be too optimistic about the prospects of firms that are issuing equity for the first time. Their results have inspired countless articles in the popular press about the danger of investing in extends to other countries as well as to seasoned equity offerings. The results concerning IPO performance, however, are controversial. Brav and Gompers (1997) show that firms that go public do not perform worse than bench- marks matched on the basis of size and book-to-market ratios. In addition, they show that value weighting IPO returns dramatically reduces the measured under- per",

    "title": "The Recovery Theorem",
    "abstract": "We can only estimate the distribution of stock returns, but from option prices we observe the distribution of state prices. State prices are the product of risk aversion— the pricing kernel—and the natural probability distribution. The Recovery Theorem enables us to separate these to determine the market’s forecast of returns and risk aversion from state prices alone. Among other things, this allows us to recover the pricing kernel, market risk premium, and probability of a catastrophe and to construct model-free tests of the efﬁcient market hypothesis. Financial Markets Price Securities with payoffs extending out in time, and the hope that they can be used to forecast the future has long fascinated both scholars and practitioners. Nowhere is this more apparent than for the ﬁxed income markets, with an enormous literature devoted to examining the predic- tive content of forward rates. However, with the exception of foreign exchange other markets. This absence is most notable for the equity markets. While there exists a rich market in equity options and a well-developed theory of how to use their prices to extract the martingale or risk-neutral probabilities (see Cox and Ross ( 1976a, 1976b)), there has been a theoretical hurdle to using these probabilities to forecast the probability distribution of future returns, that is, real or natural probabilities. Risk-neutral returns are natural returns that have been “risk adjusted.” In the risk-neutral measure, the expected re- turn",

    "title": "The Relation between Price and Performance",
    "abstract": "Gruber (1996) drew attention to the puzzle that investors buy actively managed equity mutual funds, even though on average such funds underperform index funds. We uncover another puzzling fact about the market for equity mutual funds: Funds with worse before-fee performance charge higher fees. This negative relation between fees and performance is robust and can be explained as the outcome of strategic fee-setting by mutual funds in the presence of investors with different degrees of sensitivity to performance. We also find some evidence that better fund governance may bring fees more in line with performance. Many Studies Have attempted to determine whether equity mutual funds are able to consistently earn positive risk-adjusted returns.1 Although these studies have documented significant differences in risk-adjusted returns across funds, it became apparent early on (Sharpe (1966)) that those differences are to a large has thus been aimed at determining whether the cross-sectional variation in performance that is not explained by fees can be explained by the existence of managers with superior stock-picking skills (see, e.g., Chevalier and Ellison (1999)). However, little attention has been paid to the relation between before- fee performance and fees. In this paper, we focus on this relation and investigate whether differences in fees reflect differences in the value that mutual funds create for investors. Carlos III de Madrid.

    "abstract": "Although traded as distinct products, caps and swaptions are linked by no- arbitrage relations through the correlation structure of interest rates. Using a string market model, we solve for the correlation matrix implied by swaptions and ex- amine the relative valuation of caps and swaptions. We find that swaption prices are generated by four factors and that implied correlations are lower than histor- ical correlations. Long-dated swaptions appear mispriced and there were major pricing distortions during the 1998 hedge-fund crisis. Cap prices periodically de- viate significantly from the no-arbitrage values implied by the swaptions market. THE Growth IN Interest -rate Swaps during the past decade has led to the cre- ation and rapid expansion of markets for two important types of swap-related derivatives: interest-rate caps and swaptions.

    "title": "The Risk-Adjusted Cost of Financial Distress",
    "abstract": "Financial distress is more likely to happen in bad times. The present value of distress costs therefore depends on risk premia. We estimate this value using risk-adjusted default probabilities derived from corporate bond spreads. For a BBB-rated firm, our benchmark calculations show that the NPV of distress is 4.5% of predistress value. In contrast, a valuation that ignores risk premia generates an NPV of 1.4%. We show that marginal distress costs can be as large as the marginal tax benefits of debt derived by Graham (2000). Thus, distress risk premia can help explain why firms appear to use debt conservatively.

Whether such costs are high enough to matter for corporate valuation practice and capital structure decisions is the subject of much debate. Direct costs of dis- tress, such as litigation fees, are relatively small. 1 Indirect costs, such as loss of market share (Opler and Titman (1994)) and inefficient asset sales (Shleifer and Vishny (1992)), are believed to be more important, but they are also much harder to quantify.

    "abstract": "We examine syndicates for 1,638 IPOs from January 1997 through June 2002. We find strong evidence of information production by syndicate members. Offer prices are more likely to be revised in response to information when the syndicate has more underwriters and especially more co-managers. More co-managers also result in more analyst coverage and additional market makers following the IPO. Relationships be- tween underwriters are critical in determining the composition of syndicates, perhaps because they mitigate free-riding and moral hazard problems. While there appear to be benefits to larger syndicates, we discuss several factors that may limit syndicate size. Almost ALL IPO Syndicates Include ONE or more co-managers and several non- managing underwriters. Despite this, there has been almost no recent academic cate participation. What determines the structure of an IPO syndicate? What purpose do co-managers and non-managing syndicate members serve? In this paper, we use a sample of 1,638 IPOs from January 1997 through June 2002 to examine these questions. We find evidence of information production by syndicate members. Specifi- cally, we examine how syndicate structure affects the likelihood and magnitude of offer price revisions in response to information revealed during the filing pe- riod.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates voting preferences of institutional investors using the unique setting of the securities lending market. Investors restrict lendable supply and/or recall loaned shares prior to the proxy record date to exercise voting rights. Recall is higher for investors with greater incentives to monitor, for ﬁrms with poor perfor- mance or weak governance, and for proposals where returns to governance are likely higher. At the subsequent vote, recall is associated with less support for management and more support for shareholder proposals. Our results indicate that institutions value their vote and use the proxy process to affect corporate governance. Understanding institutional investors’ preferences regarding governance is important for ﬁrms that are trying to attract new investors and for policy makers considering the regulation of governance mechanisms.

    "abstract": "Studying China’s credit market using a structural default model that integrates credit risk, liquidity, and bailout, we document improved price discovery and a deep- ening divide between state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and non-SOEs. Amidst liquid- ity deterioration, the presence of government bailout helps alleviate the heightened liquidity-driven default, making SOE bonds more valuable and widening the SOE premium. Meanwhile, the increased importance of government support makes SOEs more sensitive to bailout, while the heightened default risk increases non-SOEs’ sen- sitivity to credit quality. Examining the real impact, we ﬁnd severe performance deteriorations of non-SOEs relative to SOEs, reversing the long-standing trend of non-SOEs outperforming SOEs. THE Coexistence OF State -owned Enterprises (SOEs) with ﬁrms that are not state-owned (non-SOEs) creates the single most important divide in China’s economy, with non-SOE ﬁrms competing with the less efﬁcient but more privileged SOEs for economic, social, and political resources. On credit allocation, SOEs in China are known to have preferential access, although the actual magnitudes have not been well documented in the literature owing to previously circulated under the title “Price Discovery and Market Segmentation in China’s Credit Market.” We thank Wei Xiong (the Editor), two anonymous referees, and an Associate Editor for helpful comments and suggestions.

    "title": "The Secondary Market for Hedge Funds",
    "abstract": "Rational theories of the closed-end fund premium puzzle highlight fund share and asset illiquidity, managerial ability, and fees as important determinants of the pre- mium. Several of these attributes are difﬁcult to measure for mutual funds, and easier to measure for hedge funds. This paper employs new data from a secondary market for hedge funds, discovers a closed-hedge fund premium that is highly correlated with the closed-end mutual fund premium, and shows that the closed-hedge fund pre- mium is well explained by variables suggested by rational theories. Sentiment-based explanations do not ﬁnd support in the data. THE Closed-end Fund PREMIUMpuzzle is one of the best known in ﬁnancial eco- nomics: although the secondary market price of a closed-end mutual fund and its net asset value (NAV) are both claims to exactly the same set of underlying cash ﬂows, their levels are very different, and this difference—the premium— ﬂuctuates greatly over time. Recently, two promising solutions to this puzzle have been advanced.Berk and Stanton (2007), in the tradition of models by Boudreaux (1973), Gemmill and Thomas (2002), and Ross (2002), conjecture that the closed-end fund premium is driven by the trade-off between expecta- tions about fund managers’ ability to generate performance, and the fees paid to managers.Cherkes, Sagi, and Stanton (2009)point out that investments in closed-end funds grant investors indirect access to illiquid underlying assets with high expected returns.

Plan sponsors hire investment man- agers after large positive excess returns but this return-chasing behavior does not deliver positive excess returns thereafter. Investment managers are terminated for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to underperformance. Excess returns af- ter terminations are typically indistinguishable from zero but in some cases positive. In a sample of round-trip firing and hiring decisions, we find that if plan sponsors had stayed with fired investment managers, their excess returns would be no different from those delivered by newly hired managers.

    "abstract": "Gross spreads received by underwriters on initial public offerings (IPOs) in the United States are much higher than in other countries. Furthermore, in recent years more than 90 percent of deals raising $20-80 million have spreads of exactly seven percent, three times the proportion of a decade earlier. Investment bankers readily admit that the IPO business is very profitable, and that they avoid com- peting on fees because they \"don't want to turn it into a commodity business.\" We examine several features of the IPO underwriting business that result in a market structure where spreads are high. IT IS Widely Accepted That there are fixed costs associated with issuing se- curities, leading to economies of scale in the costs of issuing debt, equity, and hybrid securities. For initial public offerings (IPOs) of moderate size, how- ever, no economies of scale are evident when one examines the commissions paid to investment bankers, also known as the gross spreads or underwrit- ing discounts. In the period from 1995 to 1998, for the 1,111 IPOs raising between $20 and $80 million in the United States, more than 90 percent of issuers paid gross spreads of exactly seven percent. This clustering of spreads at seven percent has not always been present. There is much more clustering at seven percent now than a decade ago, although the average spread on IPOs has not changed during this period. In the 1985 to 1987 period, only about one-quarter of moderate size IPOs had spreads of exactly",

    "abstract": "Sorting countries by their dollar currency betas produces a novel cross section of average currency excess returns. A slope factor (long in high beta currencies and short in low beta currencies) accounts for this cross section of currency risk premia. This slope factor is orthogonal to the high-minus-low carry trade factor built from portfolios of countries sorted by their interest rates. The two high-minus-low risk factors account for 18% to 80% of the monthly exchange rate movements. The two risk factors suggest that stochastic discount factors in complete markets’ models should feature at least two global shocks to describe exchange rates. THE Correlation Structure OF Bilateral Exchange Rates can be summarized by a small number of principal components, but those principal components offer a purely statistical description of exchange rates and are difﬁcult to in- terpret in any micro- or macroﬁnance model. In this paper, in contrast, I report that two currency risk factors account for a substantial share of individual exchange rate time series. These factors are priced in currency markets and the shares of systematic currency risk have implications for any no-arbitrage model in international ﬁnance. Two risk factors, namely, carry and dollar, are constructed from portfolios of currencies. The carry factor corresponds to the change in exchange rates between baskets of high and low interest rate currencies, while the dollar factor corresponds to the average change in the exch",

    "abstract": "This paper analyzes the role of jumps in continuous-time short rate models. I first develop a test to detect jump-induced misspecification and, using Treasury bill rates, find evidence for the presence of jumps. Second, I specify and estimate a nonparamet- ric jump-diffusion model. Results indicate that jumps play an important statistical role. Estimates of jump times and sizes indicate that unexpected news about the macroeconomy generates the jumps. Finally, I investigate the pricing implications of jumps. Jumps generally have a minor impact on yields, but they are important for pricing interest rate options. There IS Strong Anecdotal Evidence that jumps play an important role in de- termining the dynamics of interest rate movements, although most models are based on diffusions and explicitly rule out their possibility. For example, Figure 1 displays the daily changes in the 3-month Treasury bill (T-bill) rate from 1991 to 1993, a period during which the short rate fell from 7 to just more than 3 percent; of note are the relatively infrequent but large spikes, interpreted here as “jumps.” Given the magnitude of the jumps, the obvious question is: what generated these movements? It turns out that each of the large movements in Figure 1 coincided with the arrival to the Treasury market of significant information regarding the current or future state of the economy. This observation also holds over other time periods during which news about the macroeconomy generated the larges",

    "abstract": "We find that on average, an announcement of rising unemployment is good news for stocks during economic expansions and bad news during economic contractions. Un- employment news bundles three types of primitive information relevant for valuing stocks: information about future interest rates, the equity risk premium, and corpo- rate earnings and dividends. The nature of the information bundle, and hence the relative importance of the three effects, changes over time depending on the state of the economy. For stocks as a group, information about interest rates dominates dur- ing expansions and information about future corporate dividends dominates during contractions. This Study Investigates THE Short -RUN response of stock prices to the arrival of macroeconomic news. The particular news event we consider is the Bureau of Labor Statistic’s (BLS) monthly announcement of the unemployment rate. We establish that the stock market’s response to unemployment news arrival depends on whether the economy is expanding or contracting. On average, the stock market responds positively to news of rising unemployment in expansions, and negatively in contractions. Since the economy is usually in an expansion phase, it follows that the stock market usually rises on the announcement of bad news from the labor market. Search.

    "abstract": "Using a measure of contract strictness based on the probability of a covenant violation, I investigate how lender-speciﬁc shocks impact the strictness of the loan contract that a borrower receives. Banks write tighter contracts than their peers after suffering payment defaults to their own loan portfolios, even when defaulting borrowers are in different industries and geographic regions from the current borrower. The effects persist after controlling for bank capitalization, although bank equity compression is also associated with tighter contracts. The evidence suggests that recent defaults inform the lender’s perception of its own screening ability, thereby impacting its contracting behavior. Just AS Credit Volumes have swung wildly over the past several years, the terms of loan contracts issued have been equally ﬁckle. Financial covenants requiring borrowers to maintain ﬁnancial ratios within predetermined ranges were abandoned en masse during the easy credit period from 2002 to 2006. In the aftermath of 2008’s ﬁnancial crisis, contracts swung the other way, with ﬁnancial trip wires set such that lenders receive contingent control rights for even modest borrower deterioration. Meanwhile, the effects of binding covenants on borrowers are substantial, ranging from limited access to oth- erwise committed credit facilities (Suﬁ (2009)) to increased lender inﬂuence over the real and ﬁnancial decisions of the ﬁrm (Beneish and Press (1993), Chava and Roberts (2008), Nini, Smith,",

Treasury bonds are almost always overvalued relative to Tips. Total TIPS-Treasury mispricing has ex- ceeded $56 billion, representing nearly 8% of the total amount of Tips outstanding. We ﬁnd direct evidence that the mispricing narrows as additional capital ﬂows into the markets. This provides strong support for the slow-moving-capital explanation of arbitrage persistence. THE Treasury Bond and the Treasury Inﬂation-Protected Securities (tips) markets are two of the largest and most actively traded ﬁxed-income markets in the world. Despite this, we ﬁnd that there is persistent mispricing on a massive scale across these two markets. Furthermore, this mispricing is al- most invariably in one direction—Treasury bonds are consistently overpriced relative to Tips. For example, we show that the price of a Treasury bond can exceed that of an inﬂation-swapped Tips issue exactly matching the cash ﬂows of the Treasury bond by more than $20 per $100 notional amount. The relative mispricing of Tips and Treasury bonds represents one of the largest examples of arbitrage ever documented and poses a major puzzle to classical asset pricing theory.1 We proceed by ﬁrst describing the TIPS-Treasury arbitrage strategy.

    "abstract": "This paper examines whether open market share repurchases deter takeovers. We model pre-repurchase takeover probability as a latent variable and examine its im- pact on the firm’s decision to repurchase shares. Given specification tests reject the Tobit model, we turn to the censored quantile regression method of Powell (1986,Jour- nal of Econometrics 32, 143–155). We find a significantly positive relation between open market share repurchases and takeover probability, and we reconcile empirical findings in previous studies that contradict predictions. Repurchase activity is in- versely related to firm size, consistent with smaller firms having greater information asymmetry, and is related to temporary, but not permanent, cash flows. Open Market Share Repurchase Activity has risen since the mid 1980s to become the most common method for a firm to repurchase its stock. 1 Commonly cited motives for this development include distributing free cash flows, signaling undervaluation, funding executive/employee stock option plans, adjusting cap- ital structure, and defending against unwanted takeovers. 2 However, existing empirical studies fail to find evidence that takeover deterrence is a significant motive for open market share repurchases (Dittmar (2000)). This is perhaps surprising, given the evidence indicates that other methods of repurchases, such as fixed price tender offers and Dutch auction tender offers, are often used to thwart unwanted takeover attempts.

There is no wedge at short horizons, while the wedge accounts for 40% of long-term CIP violations. Consistent with IC theory , the wedge correlates with the shadow cost of intermediary capital, and the SDF-implied interest rate is a weighted average of collateralized and uncollateralized interest rates. Covered Interest Rate Parity (CIP) violations are viewed as prima facie evidence that intermediary constraints (IC) matter for asset valuation (e.g., feedback.

    "abstract": "We build an arbitrage-based model of the yield curves in a heterogeneous monetary union with sovereign default risk, which accounts for the asymmetric shifts in euro- area yields during the Covid-19 pandemic. We derive an afﬁne term structure solu- tion, and decompose yields into expectations, term premium, expected default loss, and credit risk premium components. In an extension, we endogenize the peripheral default probability, showing that it decreases with central bank bond holdings. Cali- brating the model to Germany and Italy, we show that both the level and the shifts in the sovereign spread are mainly attributable to the credit risk premium. Following THE Great Financial Crisis of 2008 to 2009, as policy rates in advanced economies approached their effective lower bounds (ELBs), central banks relied on unconventional tools, such as large-scale asset purchases, to ﬂatten the yield curve and thereby provide further policy stimulus. In this con- text, models of the term structure have become important analytical tools for central bankers and for scholars of monetary policy. In particular, they underlie the prevailing view of the effects of asset purchase programs, which revolves around the duration risk extraction channel (e.g., Hamilton and Wu ( 2012), Greenwood and Vayanos ( 2014), or Krishnamurthy ( 2022)). Under this mecha- nism, net purchases of long-maturity bonds ﬂatten the yield curve by reducing the term premium that private markets demand to compensate for dur",

    "title": "The Term Structure with Semi-credible Targeting",
    "abstract": "The Federal Reserve sets targets for interest rates which it enforces through direct market intervention. These targets are changed periodically. In this pa- per, we develop a term structure model in which the short rate is subject to a control which keeps it close to a target which changes from time to time. The probability of target changes is not constant in the model, but changes as a function of observables. The model performs well at explaining the shifts in the yield curve that accompany target changes. IN U.S. Financial Markets, the Federal Reserve Bank (the Fed) is a unique player. Usually we assume that market participants are price takers in financial mar- kets. However, there is evidence that this is not true of the Fed. In fact, the Fed sets targets for short-term rates which it attempts to maintain by market inter- vention, injecting or withdrawing funds from the market to keep the rates near their targets. Targets are changed from time to time and market participants know when such a target change occurs. They may, in fact, have some limited ability to forecast such target changes. Several recent papers have provided evidence that models which allow the short rate to revert toward a mean, which is itself a random process, perform better than models in which the mean is constant. Jegadeesh and Pennacchi (1996) suggest the relation between such a model and the interest rate targeting of the Fed. However their model assumes a continuously varying mean that is unob",

    "title": "The Theory of Bank Risk Taking",
    "abstract": "There is a large body of literature that concludes that—when confronted with in- creased competition—banks rationally choose more risky portfolios. We argue that this literature has had a significant influence on regulators and central bankers. We review the empirical literature and conclude that the evidence is best described as “mixed.” We then show that existing theoretical analyses of this topic are fragile, since there exist fundamental risk-incentive mechanisms that operate in exactly the opposite direction, causing banks to become more risky as their markets become more concentrated. These mechanisms should be essential ingredients of models of bank competition. ITI Sahoary Notion IN Banking that “excessive competition” can lead to socially undesirable outcomes in the form of bank failures, runs, and panics. As recently noted by a prominent central banker, “The legislative reforms adopted in most countries as a response to the banking and financial crises of the 1930s shared one basic idea which was that, in order to preserve the stability of the bank- ing and financial industry, competition had to be restrained. This fundamental proposition was at the root of the reforms introduced at that time in the United States, Italy, and most other countries” Padoa-Schioppa (2001, p. 14). The ba- sic idea is that, when banks can earn monopoly rents, they become relatively conservative. Their banking charter is valuable and, thus, they shun the risk of bankruptcy, because bankrup",

    "title": "The Time-Varying Price of Financial",
    "abstract": "We introduce a new measure of the price charged by ﬁnancial intermediaries for con- necting mortgage borrowers with capital market investors. Based on administrative lender pricing data, we document that the price of intermediation reacts strongly to variation in demand, reﬂecting capacity constraints of mortgage originators. This positive comovement of price with quantity reduced the pass-through of quantitative easing. We also ﬁnd a notable upward trend in this price between 2008 and 2014, likely due to increased legal and regulatory burden in the mortgage market. The trend led to an implicit cost to borrowers of nearly $100 billion over this period. Mortgage Lending IS ONE OF the main activities of the U.S. ﬁnancial sec- tor and a principal determinant of its growth in recent decades (Greenwood and Scharfstein, 2013). For most U.S. Mortgage transactions, intermediaries directly connect borrowers with capital market investors through the market for mortgage-backed securities (MBS), rather than funding loans from deposits or other sources.1 One might expect the price of this service to be fairly low and stable. Instead, we show that the price of intermediation is highly volatile and exhibited a strong upward trend over the 2008 to 2014 period. We explore fac- tors driving this variation and study its implications for the pass-through of private sector. Paul S. Willen is at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and Nber.

    "title": "The Timing of Option Repricing",
    "abstract": "We investigate whether executive stock option repricings are systematically timed to coincide with favorable movements in the company’s stock price. For a sample of 236 repricing events, we observe sharp increases in stock price in the 20-day period follow- ing the repricing date. In addition, repricing dates tend to either precede the release of good news or follow the release of bad news in the quarterly earnings announce- ments. Since information about stock option repricing is not generally released to the public around the repricing date, these findings suggest that CEOs opportunistically manage the timing of the option repricing date. IN This Study , we examine the timing of executive stock option repricings. Options are granted to employees to align their interests with those of share- holders. However, when the firm’s stock price falls significantly below the exer- cise price of the option, the incentive effect of the option is diminished or lost. Repricing is one mechanism used to reinstate this incentive. The decision to reprice options is controversial. Managers maintain that repricing is necessary both to retain valued employees and to restore incentives lost when options are significantly out-of-the-money. Shareholders argue that management should not be selectively shielded from declines in stock price that may be a result of management’s own decisions. Shareholders further contend that repricing may undermine the integrity of future option plans. Several studie",

    "abstract": "More than 80% of U.S. Syndicated loans contain at least one fee type and contracts typically specify a menu of spreads and fee types. We test the predictions of existing theories on the main purposes of fees and provide supporting evidence that: (1) fees are used to price options embedded in loan contracts such as the drawdown option for credit lines and the cancellation option in term loans, and (2) fees are used to screen borrowers based on the likelihood of exercising these options. We also propose a new total-cost-of-borrowing measure that includes various fees charged by lenders. Fees ARE AN Important Part of corporate loan contracting. More than 80% of U.S. Syndicated loans contain at least one fee type, and contracts typically spec- ify a menu of spreads and fee types. Despite this importance, the substantial empirical literature that studies private loan contracts largely ignores their complex pricing mechanisms, focusing on a single statistic such as an interest rate spread.1 Contracts, however, are not that simple as the following example suggests.

We demonstrate empirically that a two-pillar policy is in place, aiming to balance ex- change rate ﬂexibility and RMB index stability via market and basket pillars. We further extend and validate the formulation that incorporates the so-called counter- cyclical factor. Theoretically, we develop a ﬂexible-price monetary model for the RMB in which the two-pillar policy arises endogenously as an optimal response of the gov- ernment. We estimate the model by generalized method of moments and quantita- tively assess various policy trade-offs. HOW China Manages ITS Currency , the renminbi (RMB), is among the most consequential decisions in global ﬁnancial markets. China’s economy, sec- ond only to that of the United States, has grown miraculously over the last 40 years at an average rate of more than 10% annually (Song, Storesletten, and Zilibotti ( 2011)). After joining the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, China became the world’s largest exporter in 2009. Thanks to its sizable cur- rent account surplus, which reached 10% of its GDP in 2007, China’s foreign reserves swelled to almost 4 trillion U.S. Dollars in mid-2014. The value of the RMB is thus of paramount importance in determining the competitiveness of China’s exports.

    "abstract": "We study an important recent series of buyback auctions conducted by the U.S. Trea- sury in retiring $67.5 billion of its illiquid off-the-run debt. The Treasury was suc- cessful in buying back large amounts of illiquid debt while suffering only a small market-impact cost. The Treasury included the most-illiquid bonds more frequently in the auctions, but tended to buy back the least-illiquid of these bonds. Although the Treasury had the option to cherry pick from among the bonds offered, we find that the Treasury was actually penalized for being spread too thinly in the buybacks.

The buyback auctions differed from the standard Treasury auctions used to issue bills and bonds in several important ways. Foremost among these was that the bonds involved were older and less-liquid issues, contrasting sharply with the usual Treasury issuance auction for highly liquid on-the-run bills and bonds.

    "title": "The Underwriter Persistence Phenomenon",
    "abstract": "This study presents new evidence that initial IPO returns have persistent underwriter-specific components. These components cannot be explained by existing measures of underwriter quality, underwriter service, or controls for several known predictors of initial IPO returns. Tests that trace the roots of persistence most broadly support theories of asymmetric information among underwriters. I present such a model, and consistent with its predictions, I find that high underpricing underwriters (1) are responsible for a majority of the partial adjustment phenomenon, (2) make more informed analyst revisions, (3) experience superior market share growth, and (4) are more likely to serve an institutional clientele. IN A Sample OF U.s.initial Public Offerings from 1984 to 2000, the average IPO experiences initial returns of 22.7%. Using quartiles based on underwriter- specific past initial returns, I find that underwriters in the highest quartile bring to market future IPOs with 32.1% initial returns, compared to just 17.4% for those in the lowest quartile. This economically large spread of 14.7% is ro- bust to controls for known predictors of initial returns such as size, underwriter prestige, industry, and hot IPO markets. Persistent initial return differences ex- ist for large and small underwriters alike, and are stable in both the 1980s and the 1990s.

    "abstract": "The value anomaly arises naturally in the neoclassical framework with rational ex- pectations. Costly reversibility and countercyclical price of risk cause assets in place to be harder to reduce, and hence are riskier than growth options especially in bad times when the price of risk is high. By linking risk and expected returns to eco- nomic primitives, such as tastes and technology, my model generates many empirical regularities in the cross-section of returns; it also yields an array of new refutable WHY DO Value Stocks Earn Higher Expected Returns than growth stocks? This ap- pears to be a troublesome anomaly for rational expectations, because according to conventional wisdom, growth options hinge upon future economic conditions and must be riskier than assets in place. In a widely used corporate finance textbook, Grinblatt and Titman (2001, p. 392) contend that “Growth opportuni- ties are usually the source of high betas,..., because growth options tend to be most valuable in good times and have implicit leverage, which tends to increase beta, they contain a great deal of systematic risk.” Gomes, Kogan, and Zhang (2003) also predict that growth options are always riskier than assets in place, as these options are “leveraged” on existing assets. Growth stocks, which derive market values more from growth options, must therefore be riskier than value stocks, which derive market values more from assets in place.

    "abstract": "We examine (1) how value premiums vary with firm size, (2) whether the Capm explains value premiums, and (3) whether, in general, average returns compensate β in the way predicted by the Capm. Loughran’s (1997) evidence for a weak value premium among large firms is special to 1963 to 1995, U.S. Stocks, and the book-to- market value-growth indicator. Ang and Chen’s (2005) evidence that the Capm can explain U.S. Value premiums is special to 1926 to 1963. The CAPM’s more general problem is that variation in β unrelated to size and the value-growth characteristic goes unrewarded throughout 1926 to 2004. Turns for the post-1963 period; that is, stocks with high ratios of the book value of equity to the market value of equity (value stocks) have higher average returns than stocks with low book-to-market ratios (growth stocks). Extending the tests back to 1926, Davis, Fama, and French (2000) document a value premium in the average returns of the earlier period. Perhaps more important, Fama and French (1993) find that the post-1963 value premium is left unexplained by the Capital Asset Pricing Model (capm) of Sharpe (1964) and Lintner (1965). Ang and Chen (2005) show, however, that the Capm captures the value premium of the 1926 to 1963 period. They also argue that when the tests allow for time-varying market βs, even the post- 1963 period produces no reliable evidence against a Capm story for the value premium.

    "abstract": "We decompose the cross-sectional variance of firms' book-to-market ratios using both a long U.S. Panel and a shorter international panel. In contrast to typical aggregate time-series results, transitory cross-sectional variation in ex- pected 15-year stock returns causes only a relatively small fraction (20 to 25 percent) of the total cross-sectional variance. The remaining dispersion can be explained by expected 15-year profitability and persistence of valuation levels. Furthermore, this fraction appears stable across time and across types of stocks.We also show that the expected return on value-minus-growth strategies is atypically high at times when their spread in book-to-market ratios is wide. Intuitively, Both Expected Stock Returns and expected cash-flow growth play a role in determining the market price of a firm's stock and, thus, its book-to-market ratio. Firms with high book-to-market ratios have on average higher subsequent stock returns than firms with low book-to-market ratios (Rosenberg, Reid, and Lanstein (1985), Fama and French (1992), and others). Simultaneously, differences in firms' book-to-market ratios are also related to differences in future expected cash-flow and earnings growth as well as future profitability. Low-book-to-market firms grow faster and are persistently more profitable than high-book-to-market firms. The relative importance of these two contributing factors to cross-sectional variation in firms' book-to-market ratios remains an open emp",

    "abstract": "Using a novel data set of realized syndicated loan cash ﬂows and a risk-adjustment methodology adapted from the private equity literature, I provide a measure of risk- adjusted returns for bank loan cash ﬂows. Banks, on average, generate 180 basis points in gross risk-adjusted returns and add $75 million of value annually to their loan portfolios. Banks earn higher returns when they lend to ﬁnancially constrained borrowers, and the risk-adjusted performance of bank loan portfolios exhibits persis- tence. However, banks require higher risk-adjusted returns when facing their own ﬁnancing frictions, and shareholders earn nearly zero net risk-adjusted returns once bank staff are compensated for their lending effort. Overall, these ﬁndings suggest that banks provide valuable services to mitigate borrowers’ ﬁnancing frictions, and the present value of loan cash ﬂows pays for the costs of providing these services. WHY DO Banks Exist?c Lassic theories suggest that they add value through services such as maturity and liquidity transformation, risk diversiﬁcation, and screening and monitoring of borrowers.

    "title": "The Value of Central Clearing",
    "abstract": "I study a contracting innovation that suddenly insulated traders of hedging contracts against counterparty risk: central clearing counterparties (CCPs) for derivatives. The ﬁrst CCP was created in Le Havre (France) in 1882, in the coffee futures market. Using triple difference-in-differences estimation, I show that central clearing changed the geography of trade ﬂows Europe-wide, to the beneﬁt of Le Havre. Inspecting the mechanism using trader-level data, I ﬁnd that the CCP solved both a “missing market” problem and adverse selection issues. Central clearing also facilitated entry of new traders in the market. The successful contracting innovation quickly spread to other exchanges. Financial Frictions CAN Prevent GAINSfrom trade from being realized and thus resources from being efﬁciently allocated. However, whether ﬁnancial frictions impair trade is not exogenous: agents can design contracts to mitigate or undo their effects (Allen and Gale (1988)). Throughout history, a number of contract- ing innovations—from the bill of exchange to limited liability—improved cap- ital allocation and risk-sharing, thus contributing to long-term growth (North (1991)). Yet empirically identifying the causal impact of contracting innova- tions on resource allocation is challenging. In particular, it is often difﬁcult to precisely date the appearance of contracting forms that are now widespread in ﬁnancial markets, and data to study these events are often lacking.

    "abstract": "We develop a search model of block trades that values the illiquidity of controlling stakes. The model considers several dimensions of illiquidity. First, following a liq- uidity shock, the controlling blockholder is forced to sell, possibly to a less efﬁcient acquirer. Second, this sale may occur at a ﬁre sale price. Third, absent a liquidity shock, a trade occurs only if a potential buyer arrives. Using a structural estima- tion approach and U.S. Data on trades of controlling blocks of public corporations, we estimate the value of control, blockholders’ marketability discount, and dispersed shareholders’ illiquidity-spillover discount. High Ownership Concentration is a predominant phenomenon in the corpo- rate world. In many countries, including the United States, evidence suggests that high ownership concentration is pervasive in public corporations.1 By deﬁnition, ownership concentration is also an integral part of privately held corporations.2 In this paper, we study the value of controlling blocks of shares in public corporations, and thus contribute to our understanding of the costs and beneﬁts of concentrated ownership. An inherent difﬁculty in valuing control- ling blocks of shares is the illiquidity of the market.

    "abstract": "We model and estimate the value of corporate risk management. We show how risk management can add value when revenues and costs are nonlinearly related to prices and estimate the model by regressing quarterly firm sales and costs on the second and higher moments of output and input prices. For a sample of 34 oil refiners, we find that hedging concave revenues and leaving concave costs exposed each represent between 2% and 3% of firm value. We validate our approach by regressing Tobin’s q on the estimated value and level of risk management and find results consistent with the model. Smith AND Stulz (1985) Show how corporate hedging can add value when firms face convex costs such as progressive taxation and bankruptcy costs. Their cen- tral idea—that nonlinearities justify hedging—has since been applied to other financial factors such as costly external finance, information asymmetry, and managerial risk aversion. 1 However, empirical support for these theories is limited and mixed.2 Theorists have ignored real-side factors behind risk man- agement and empiricists have relied on Capm extensions that might interest diversified investors but subsume the information relevant to corporate risk versity.

    "title": "The Value of Embedded Real Options: Evidence",
    "abstract": "Under the common assumption of constant interest rates, we show that penalties for early termination of a lease are often structured in such a way that the cancellation option embedded in consumer automotive leases has little value. Furthermore, our estimates drawn from a sample of three popular car models over 1990 to 2000 indicate that the stand-alone value of the lease-end purchase option is, on average, about 16% of the market value of underlying used vehicles, or about $1,462 per contract. Finally, we examine the sensitivity of our option value estimates to model parameters and default risk. Recent Years Have Witnessed A Dramatic Growth in the leasing of automobiles. For instance, overall industry sales data indicate that about a third of the new vehicles and trucks sold in the United States are leased (Hendel and Lizzeri (2002), and Miller (1995)), and the Federal Reserve Board survey of family finances reports that the use of leased vehicles by individuals (nonbusiness consumers) has risen from 2.9% to 5.8% over the 1992 to 2001 period (Azicorbe, Kennickell, and Moore (2003)). Consumer automobile lease contracts for new cars often include two embedded options that are not associated with a typical debt contract. The first is a cancellation option that allows the lessee to ter- minate the lease early. The second is a European call option, which gives the lessee the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the leased (used) vehicle at the scheduled termination of the l",

    "title": "The Value of Financial Flexibility",
    "abstract": "We develop a model that endogenizes dynamic financing, investment, and cash re- tention/payout policies in order to analyze the effect of financial flexibility on firm value. We show that the value of financing flexibility depends on the costs of external financing, the level of corporate and personal tax rates that determine the effective cost of holding cash, the firm’s growth potential and maturity, and the reversibility of capital. Through simulations, we demonstrate that firms facing financing frictions should simultaneously borrow and lend, and we examine the nature of dynamic debt and liquidity policies and the value associated with corporate liquidity. Recent Surveys OF American AND European Cfos suggest that the most im- portant driver of firms’ capital structure decisions is the desire to attain and preserve financial flexibility. 1 Financial flexibility represents the ability of a firm to access and restructure its financing at a low cost. Financially flexible firms are able to avoid financial distress in the face of negative shocks, and to readily fund investment when profitable opportunities arise. While a firm’s financial flexibility depends on external financing costs that may reflect firm characteristics such as size, it is also a result of strategic decisions made by the firm related to capital structure, liquidity, and investment. In this paper, we explore how firms should optimally manage their financial flexibility in the face of various transaction costs",

    "title": "The Value of Investment Banking Relationships:",
    "abstract": "We examine the long-standing question of whether ﬁrms derive value from invest- ment bank relationships by studying how the Lehman collapse affected industrial ﬁrms that received underwriting, advisory, analyst, and market-making services from Lehman. Equity underwriting clients experienced an abnormal return of around –5%, on average, in the 7 days surrounding Lehman’s bankruptcy, amounting to $23 bil- lion in aggregate risk-adjusted losses. Losses were especially severe for companies that had stronger and broader security underwriting relationships with Lehman or were smaller, younger, and more ﬁnancially constrained. Other client groups were not adversely affected. THE Question OF Whether ﬁrms derive value from investment banking (IB) relationships has received considerable attention in the literature, especially since the increasingly competitive market for IB services would suggest that come up with an unambiguous answer, however, due in part to the difﬁculty in measuring the value of relationship capital.

    "title": "The Variability of IPO Initial Returns",
    "abstract": "The monthly volatility of IPO initial returns is substantial, ﬂuctuates dramatically over time, and is considerably larger during “hot” IPO markets. Consistent with IPO theory, the volatility of initial returns is higher for ﬁrms that are more difﬁcult to value because of higher information asymmetry. Our ﬁndings highlight underwriters’ difﬁculty in valuing companies characterized by high uncertainty, and raise serious questions about the efﬁcacy of the traditional ﬁrm-commitment IPO process. One implication of our results is that alternate mechanisms, such as auctions, could be beneﬁcial for ﬁrms that value price discovery over the auxiliary services provided by underwriters. Initial Public Offerings (ipos) are underpriced on average: The secondary market trading price of a stock is on average much higher than its IPO price. A number of academic papers note that the equity in private companies with uncertain prospects is inherently difﬁcult to value, and they posit that under- pricing is an efﬁcient response to the complexity of this valuation problem.1 In contrast, others have questioned whether the IPO price-setting process results in excess underpricing of IPO stocks. This article proposes a new metric for evaluating the pricing of IPOs in tradi- tional ﬁrm-commitment offerings: the volatility of initial returns to IPO stocks. We ﬁnd that there is considerable volatility in initial returns. To the extent that the IPO price is a forecast of the secondary market price for t",

    "abstract": "We use estimates of the Black-Scholes sensitivity of managers' stock option port- folios to stock return volatility and the sensitivity of managers' stock and stock option portfolios to stock price to test the relationship between managers' risk preferences and hedging activities. We find that as the sensitivity of managers' stock and stock option portfolios to stock price increases, firms tend to hedge more. However, as the sensitivity of managers' stock option portfolios to stock return volatility increases, firms tend to hedge less. ONE OF THE Agency Costs associated with the corporate form of ownership comes from the risk aversion of the firm's managers. The typical corporate manager has a significant portion of his or her wealth invested in the cor- poration, both through portfolio holdings and the value of firm-specific hu- man capital. As a result, managers have an incentive to reduce firm risk more than may be desirable from the perspective of an unaffiliated, diver- sified shareholder. One way to mitigate managerial risk aversion is to pro- vide the manager with contracts that have a payoff structure that is a convex function of the firm's stock price (Smith and Stulz (1985)). Guay (1999) finds that stock options are an important way in which convexity is added to managers' portfolios. However, as recognized by Carpenter (2000) and Lambert, Larcker, and Verrecchia (1991), stock options create two opposing effects on managerial incentives. The first effect is sensitiv",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates whether improvements in the ﬁrm’s internal corporate gov- ernance create value for shareholders. We analyze the market reaction to governance proposals that pass or fail by a small margin of votes in annual meetings. This pro- vides a clean causal estimate that deals with the endogeneity of internal governance rules. We ﬁnd that passing a proposal leads to signiﬁcant positive abnormal returns. Adopting one governance proposal increases shareholder value by 2.8%. The market reaction is larger in ﬁrms with more antitakeover provisions, higher institutional ownership, and stronger investor activism for proposals sponsored by institutions. In addition, we ﬁnd that acquisitions and capital expenditures decline and long-term performance improves. Corporate Governance Provisions grant managers independence to man- age the ﬁrm. However, they also insulate managers from the monitoring and control of shareholders. 1 Establishing empirically how these provisions affect shareholder value and what type of shareholder rights have greater effects is essential for our understanding of the internal governance of ﬁrms. In practice, it is generally difﬁcult to ﬁnd a setting in which a ﬁrm’s governance structure changes exogenously. As a result, the existing literature has generally not been able to provide causal estimates of the effect of these corporate governance provisions. 2 Furthermore, the range of results in the Nber, Cepr, and IZA.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we test whether ﬁrms properly adjust for risk in their capital budget- ing decisions. If managers use a single discount rate within ﬁrms, we expect that conglomerates underinvest (overinvest) in relatively safe (risky) divisions. We mea- sure division relative risk as the difference between the division’s asset beta and a ﬁrm-wide beta. We establish a robust and signiﬁcant positive relationship between division-level investment and division relative risk. Next, we measure the value loss due to this behavior in the context of acquisitions. When the bidder’s beta is lower than that of the target, announcement returns are signiﬁcantly lower. IN This Paper , WE Provide evidence that ﬁrms fail to properly adjust for risk in their valuation of investment projects, and that such behavior leads to value- destroying investment decisions. According to the standard textbook formula, the value of an investment project depends on both its expected cash ﬂows and its discount rate, which is a measure of risk. In practice, however, survey evidence shows that most ﬁrms use only a single discount rate to value all of their projects (Bierman ( 1993), Graham and Harvey ( 2001)), a behavior that we label the “wacc fallacy.” The weighted average cost of capital (wacc) fallacy is a failure to account for project-speciﬁc risk, which is particularly damaging when the ﬁrm has to decide between heterogeneous projects. The value of riskier projects will be overestimated, while that of saf",

    "title": "The Wall Street Walk when Blockholders",
    "abstract": "Effective monitoring by equity blockholders is important for good corporate gover- nance. A prominent theoretical literature argues that the threat of block sale (“exit”) can be an effective governance mechanism. Many blockholders are money managers. We show that, when money managers compete for investor capital, the threat of exit loses credibility, weakening its governance role. Money managers with more skin in the game will govern more successfully using exit. Allowing funds to engage in activist measures (“voice”) does not alter our qualitative results. Our results link widely prevalent incentives in the ever-expanding money management industry to the nature of corporate governance. Equity Blockholders IN Publicly traded corporations who are dissatisﬁed with the actions of company management can sell their blocks—the so-called “Wall Street Walk.” A growing theoretical literature starting with Admati and Pﬂei- derer ( 2009) and Edmans ( 2009) argues that the Wall Street Walk can be an effective form of governance. The exit of a blockholder will typically depress the stock price, punishing management whenever executive compensation is linked to the market price of equity. Thus, faced with a credible threat of exit, management will be reluctant to underperform. Admati and Pﬂeiderer argue that, when blockholders observe managers underperforming, it is in their own interest to exit early before information about the manager’s underperformance becomes public. This makes exit a",

This steadfastness was re- warded in the subsequent bull market. Despite unusual interest in some “experience” stocks (e.g., cannabis stocks), they tilted primarily toward stocks with high past share volume and dollar-trading volume (themselves mostly big stocks). From mid-2018 to mid-2020, an aggregated crowd consensus portfolio (a proxy for the household-equal- weighted portfolio) had both good timing and good alpha. THE Online Retail Brokerage Company Robinhood (RH) was founded in 2013 with a plan to make it easier and cheaper for small investors to partic- ipate in the stock and option markets. Its customers are widely believed to be a new breed of mostly young, small, computer-savvy but novice investor. Some reports have pegged their typical account sizes as low as $2,000. By mid- 2020, Robinhood was reported to have attracted a clientele of over 13 million investors, more than twice the population of Finland. The active participation of such tiny investors on this large scale is a new phenomenon. Thus, the academic literature still knows very little about them.

We propose a credit multiplier driven by these considerations and empirically isolate its impor- tance by comparing how a similar ﬁrm responds to shocks differently when these shocks are initiated in their most proﬁtable quarter (“main quarter”). We implement this test using recurring and unpredictable shocks (e.g., oil shocks) and provide exten- sive evidence supporting our identiﬁcation strategy . Our results suggest that funding constraints and credit multiplier effects are signiﬁcant for smaller ﬁrms that heavily rely on ﬁnancing from suppliers. ONE OF THE Central Questions in ﬁnance is how ﬁnancing frictions af- fect ﬁrms and the real economy . An inﬂuential idea in this context is the exis- tence of a ﬁnancial accelerator or credit multiplier effect (e.g., Bernanke and Gertler (1989) and Kiyotaki and Moore (1997)). In the presence of ﬁnancing frictions, short-term operating losses can lead to borrowing problems that are both ampliﬁed and propagated over time through their impact on ﬁrms’ bal- ance sheets.

A study of the 103 countries that have stock markets reveals that insider trading laws exist in 87 of them, but enforcement-as evi- denced by prosecutions-has taken place in only 38 of them. Before 1990, the re- spective numbers were 34 and 9. We find that the cost of equity in a country, after controlling for a number of other variables, does not change after the introduction of insider trading laws, but decreases significantly after the first prosecution.

    "abstract": "Prices and returns are alternative ways to present information and to elicit expec- tations in ﬁnancial markets. But do investors think of prices and returns in the same way? We present three studies in which subjects differ in the level of exper- tise, amount of information, and type of incentive scheme. The results are consistent across all studies: asking subjects to forecast returns as opposed to prices results in higher expectations, whereas showing them return charts rather than price charts re- sults in lower expectations. Experience is not a useful remedy but cognitive reﬂection mitigates the impact of format changes. Prices AND Returns ARE Alternative ways to present ﬁnancial market infor- mation and to elicit ﬁnancial market expectations in surveys. According to normative decision theory, expectations are invariant to superﬁcial changes in the way the information is presented and the way they are elicited. However, do investors understand a chart of a fund’s performance in the same way when the performance chart plots past prices or past returns? And is it the same to ask an analyst to forecast prices or returns?

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a new hand-collected data set that tracks restrictions on share- holder rights at approximately 1,000 ﬁrms from 1978 to 1989. In conjunction with the 1990 to 2006 Irrc data, we track shareholder rights over 30 years. Most gov- ernance changes occurred during the 1980s. We ﬁnd a robustly negative association between restrictions on shareholder rights (usingG-Index as a proxy) and Tobin’sQ. The negative association only appears after judicial approval of antitakeover defenses in the 1985 landmark Delaware Supreme Court decision ofMoran v. Household. This decision was an unanticipated exogenous shock that increased the importance of shareholder rights. IN This Paper, we explore the relationship between shareholder rights and ﬁrm value over the 1978 to 2006 period. Including pre-1990 data is particularly valuable because substantial changes along three dimensions potentially af- fecting this relationship occurred during this period. First, the 1980s saw the rise and fall of a substantial takeover market, including a hostile takeover market. Second, the law surrounding the use of antitakeover defenses, which we treat as limiting shareholder rights, also experienced considerable ﬂux.

In this paper, we show that a bank’s stock return performance during the 1998 crisis predicts its stock return performance and probability of failure during the recent ﬁnancial crisis. This effect is economically large. Our ﬁndings are consistent with persistence in a bank’s risk culture and/or aspects of its business model that make its performance sensitive to crises. Banks that relied more on short-term funding, had more leverage, and grew more are more likely to be banks that performed poorly in both crises. IS There Something Unique about certain banks that makes them perform worse in a crisis? Some aspects of their business model could make them more sensitive to crises, but so could their risk culture. There has been considerable discussion about the risk culture of Goldman Sachs and why this risk culture allowed it to perform better than its competitors during the crisis. 1 More re- cently, the difﬁculties of former high executives of Goldman Sachs such as John Corzine in their post-Goldman Sachs life have been viewed as further evidence that these executives were successful at Goldman Sachs not simply because of ∗Fahlenbrach is Associate Professor at the Ecole Polytechnique F´ed´erale de Lausanne (epfl), We thank two anonymous referees, an Associate Editor, Viral Acharya, Andrea Beltratti, Amit Goyal, Cam Harvey (the Editor), Florian Heider, Olivier De Jonghe, Jun-Koo Kang, Chris- tian Laux, Claudio L",

    "title": "Threshold Events and Identiﬁcation: A Study",
    "abstract": "Threshold events are discrete events triggered when an observable continuous variable passes a known threshold. We demonstrate how to use threshold events as identiﬁcation strategies by revisiting the evidence in Rauh (2006, Investment and ﬁnancing constraints: Evidence from the funding of corporate pension plans, Journal of Finance61, 33–71) that mandatory pension contributions cause invest- ment declines. Rauh’s result stems from heavily underfunded ﬁrms that constitute a small fraction of the sample and that differ sharply from the rest of the sample. To al- leviate this issue, we use observations near funding thresholds and ﬁnd causal effects of mandatory contributions on receivables, R&D, and hiring, but not on investment. We also provide useful suggestions and diagnostics for analyzing threshold events. THE Identification OF Causal Effects is of central interest in empirical cor- porate ﬁnance. One particularly interesting class of identiﬁcation strategies involves the use of threshold events, in which a discrete event or treatment oc- curs when an observable continuous variable passes a known threshold. These thresholds can occur because of accounting conventions, government regula- tions, or contractual agreements, among other things. Given the increasing use of identiﬁcation strategies based on threshold events, the intent of this paper is threefold. First, we provide general guidance on how one can and cannot use threshold events to identify causal relationships. We",

    "abstract": "A mutual fund manager is more likely to buy (or sell) a particular stock in any quarter if other managers in the same city are buying (or selling) that same stock. This pattern shows up even when the fund manager and the stock in question are located far apart, so it is distinct from anything having to do with local preference. The evidence can be interpreted in terms of an epidemic model in which investors spread information about stocks to one another by word of mouth. IN This Paper , WE Explore THE Hypothesis that investors spread information and ideas about stocks to one another directly, through word-of-mouth communica- tion. This hypothesis comes up frequently in informal accounts of the behav- ior of the stock market. 1 For example, in his bestseller Irrational Exuberance, Shiller (2000) devotes an entire chapter to the subject of “Herd Behavior and Epidemics,” and writes A fundamental observation about human society is that people who communicate regularly with one another think similarly. There is at any place and in any time a Zeitgeist,aspirit of the times. ...Word-of-mouth transmission of ideas appears to be an important contributor to day-to-day or hour-to-hour stock market fluctuations.

    "abstract": "This paper explores the economic role credit rating agencies play in the corporate bond market. We consider three existing theories about multiple ratings: information production, rating shopping, and regulatory certiﬁcation. Using differences in rating composition, default prediction, and credit spread changes, our evidence only supports regulatory certiﬁcation. Marginal, additional credit ratings are more likely to occur because of, and seem to matter primarily for, regulatory purposes. They do not seem to provide signiﬁcant additional information related to credit quality. Credit Rating Agencies(cras) Report information about the credit risk of ﬁxed income securities. The various ways the information is used by ﬁnancial, legal, and regulatory entities may potentially inﬂuence the nature of the information production process. Bond ratings are used not only for risk assessment, but also for regulatory certiﬁcation, that is, for classiﬁcation of securities into in- vestment grade (IG) and high yield (HY, or junk) status. These classiﬁcations in turn inﬂuence institutional demand and serve as bright-line triggers in corpo- rate credit arrangements and regulatory oversight. Regulations may mandate that insurance companies and banks keep much higher reserve capital for HY issues than for IG corporate bonds. Other institutions such as pension funds and mutual funds are often restricted by their charters with respect to the amount of HY debt they can hold. Taken together, more tha",

    "abstract": "We investigate whether business ties with portfolio ﬁrms inﬂuence mutual funds’ proxy voting using a comprehensive data set spanning 2003 to 2011. In contrast to prior literature, we ﬁnd that business ties signiﬁcantly inﬂuence promanagement voting at the level of individual pairs of fund families and ﬁrms after controlling for Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) recommendations and holdings. The associa- tion is signiﬁcant only for shareholder-sponsored proposals and stronger for those that pass or fail by relatively narrow margins. Our ﬁndings are consistent with a demand- driven model of biased voting in which company managers use existing business ties with funds to inﬂuence how they vote. Mutual Funds ARE OF Great importance to both retail investors and corpo- rations. They are the main investment vehicle for retail investors, not least via their role in managing pension portfolios through 401(K) plans. They are also highly relevant to corporate governance as they collectively own 24% of U.S. Corporate equity 1 and large fund families hold blocks of 10% or more in dozens of large U.S. Corporations (Davis and Yoo ( 2003)).

    "abstract": "We show that market-maker balance sheet and income statement variables explain time variation in liquidity, suggesting liquidity-supplier ﬁnancing constraints matter. Using 11 years of Nyse specialist inventory positions and trading revenues, we ﬁnd that aggregate market-level and specialist ﬁrm-level spreads widen when specialists have large positions or lose money. The effects are nonlinear and most prominent when inventories are big or trading results have been particularly poor. These sensi- tivities are smaller after specialist ﬁrm mergers, consistent with deep pockets easing ﬁnancing constraints. Finally, compared to low volatility stocks, the liquidity of high volatility stocks is more sensitive to inventories and losses. Asset Market Liquidity VARIESconsiderably over time. This variation matters to market participants who worry about the cost of trading into or out of a desired position in a short period of time. Liquidity can affect asset prices, too. For example, investors may demand higher rates of return as compensation for holding illiquid assets and assets that are particularly sensitive to ﬂuctu- ations in liquidity. However, despite the interest in aggregate liquidity from both of these angles, we know relatively little about exactly why market liq- uidity varies over time.

    "title": "Time Variation in the Covariance between Stock",
    "abstract": "The conditional covariance between aggregate stock returns and aggregate consump- tion growth varies substantially over time. When stock market wealth is high relative to consumption, both the conditional covariance and correlation are high. This pattern is consistent with the “composition effect,” where agents’ consumption growth is more closely tied to stock returns when stock wealth is a larger share of total wealth. This variation can be used to test asset-pricing models in which the price of consumption risk varies. After accounting for variations in this price, the relation between expected excess stock returns and the conditional covariance is negative. That there are predictable variations in excess returns to the stock market. The uncertainty in this conclusion is partially driven by our inability to interpret comfortably these variations in a sensible model of asset pricing. In a world of rational investors who care about consumption, variations in expected excess returns should be driven by variations in either the amount of “consumption risk” in stock returns—the conditional covariance between stock returns and consumption—or the required compensation per unit of consumption risk. But attempts to link these potential explanations to the data have either failed empirically or have not been rigorously tested.

    "title": "Time Variation of the Equity Term Structure",
    "abstract": "I study the term structure of one-period expected returns on dividend claims with different maturity . I ﬁnd that the slope of the term structure is countercyclical. The countercyclical variation is consistent with theories of long-run risk and habit, but these theories cannot explain the average downward slope. At the same time, the cyclical variation is inconsistent with recent models constructed to match the average downward slope. More generally , the average and cyclicality of the slope are hard to reconcile with models with a single risk factor. I introduce a model with two priced factors to solve the puzzle. This Paper Documents Cyclical Variation in the term structure of equity returns. Understanding this variation is important for understanding which risks drive ﬂuctuations in the equity risk premium. The cyclical variation docu- mented in this paper suggests that ﬂuctuations in the equity risk premium are driven mainly by long-maturity risks such as long-run risk dividend growth or discount rate risk, and less by short-maturity risks such as disaster risk. This ﬁnding is, however, a puzzle because it is inconsistent with the set of models that can replicate the average slope of the equity term structure. The cycli- cal variation is also important for understanding time variation in valuation ratios on equity claims and the extent to which this variation is predictable.

    "abstract": "We use Hasbrouck's (1991) vector autoregressive model for prices and trades to empirically test and assess the role played by the waiting time between consecu- tive transactions in the process of price formation. We find that as the time dura- tion between transactions decreases, the price impact of trades, the speed of price adjustment to trade-related information, and the positive autocorrelation of signed trades all increase. This suggests that times when markets are most active are times when there is an increased presence of informed traders; we interpret such markets as having reduced liquidity. THE Availability OF Large data sets on transaction data and powerful com- putational devices has generated a new wave of interest in market micro- of its hypotheses. The microstructure literature is mainly devoted to the study of the mechanics of price formation, examining questions such as, \"What are the determinants of the behavior of prices?\" and \"How is new informa- tion incorporated into prices?\"'1 Hasbrouck's (1991) analysis reveals that the change in prices depends on characteristics of trades (sign and size) and the market environment as measured by bid-ask spread, in addition to the cur- rent and past levels of prices. At time t, when a trade is performed, larger transaction size and spread imply a larger price revision after the trade. Furthermore, not only does volume affect prices, but it has a persistent im- pact on prices, which means volume conveys information. Th",

    "abstract": "I present a model of consumption and savings for a multiperson household in which members are imperfectly altruistic, derive utility from both private and shared public goods, and share wealth. I show that, despite having standard exponential time pref- erences, the household is time-inconsistent: Members save too little and overspend on private consumption goods. The household remains time-inconsistent even when members save separately , because the possibility of voluntary transfers or joint con- tribution to the public good preserves the dynamic commons problem. The household will choose to share wealth when the risk-sharing beneﬁts outweigh the utility cost of overconsumption. Standard Theory OF Household Financial decision making is based on the behavior of a single maximizing agent. However, a considerable body of empirical work strongly rejects the unitary model as an adequate description of household decision making (see, for example, Lundberg, Pollak, and Wales (1997), Browning and Chiappori (1998), Phipps and Burton (1998), Ashraf (2009), and Cesarini et al. (2017)). The key lesson from this literature is that household members have distinct preferences and are self-interested, caring more about the utility from their own consumption than their partners. These empirical ﬁndings have led to considerable theoretical work that reconsiders the static theory of household demand for goods and labor supply (see, for example, Chiappori (1988), Browning et al.

    "abstract": "Most extant structural credit risk models underestimate credit spreads—a shortcom- ing known as the credit spread puzzle. We consider a model with priced stochastic asset risk that is able to ﬁt medium- to long-term spreads. The model, augmented by jumps to help explain short-term spreads, is estimated on ﬁrm-level data and identi- ﬁes signiﬁcant asset variance risk premia. An important feature of the model is the signiﬁcant time variation in risk premia induced by the uncertainty about asset risk. Various extensions are considered, among them optimal leverage and endogenous de- fault.

Moreover, thesame fund managers that pick stocks well in expansions also time the market well in recessions. These fund managers signiﬁcantly outperform other funds and passive benchmarks. Our results suggest a new measure of managerial ability that weighs a fund’s market timing more in recessions and stock picking more in booms. The measure displays more persistence than either market timing or stock picking alone and predicts fund performance. A Large Literature STUDIESwhether investment managers add value for their clients, and if so how. One way to shed light on these questions is to decompose fund performance into stock picking and market timing. Previous work esti- mates picking and timing implicitly assuming that each manager is endowed with a ﬁxed amount of each skill. But stock picking and market timing are not talents one is born with. They are the result of time spent analyzing data. Like workers in other jobs, fund managers may choose to focus on different tasks at different points in time. This simple idea leads us to evaluate fund manager skill in a way that allows its nature to change, depending on economic con- ditions. Our results show that successful managers pick stocks well in booms and time the market well in recessions. This suggests that stock picking and market timing are tasks",

    "abstract": "Data on corporate governance and disclosure practices reveal wide within-country variation that decreases with the strength of investors’ legal protection. A simple model identifies three firm attributes related to that variation: investment oppor- tunities, external financing, and ownership structure. Using firm-level governance and transparency data from 27 countries, we find that all three firm attributes are related to the quality of governance and disclosure practices, and firms with higher governance and transparency rankings are valued higher in stock markets. All rela- tions are stronger in less investor-friendly countries, demonstrating that firms adapt to poor legal environments to establish efficient governance practices. Previous Studies Show That Better Legal Protection for investors is associated with higher valuation of the stock market (La Porta et al.

    "abstract": "Incorporating debt in a dynamic real options framework, we show that underinvest- ment stems from truncation of equity’s horizon at default. Debt overhang distorts both the level and composition of investment, with underinvestment being more se- vere for long-lived assets. An empirical proxy for the shadow price of capital to equity is derived. Use of this proxy yields a structural test for debt overhang and its mitiga- tion through issuance of additional secured debt. Using measurement error-consistent GMM estimators, we find a statistically significant debt overhang effect regardless of firms’ ability to issue additional secured debt. IN Dynamic Investment Models , the shadow price of capital, or marginal q,i sa sufficient statistic for investment. 1 Since marginal q is unobservable, Tobin’s average Q, the ratio of equity plus debt value to replacement cost of the capital stock, is commonly used as an empirical proxy. Hayashi (1982) and Abel and Eberly (1994) provide formal justifications for this practice, deriving conditions under which average Q and marginal q are equal. A drawback of both models is that they preclude any role for financial structure by assuming that the firm is financed exclusively with equity. Starting with the Abel and Eberly (1994) model of first-best investment, where marginal and average Q are equal, this paper analyzes the investment policy of an equity-maximizing firm with long-term debt outstanding. 2 In this situation, levered equity’s marginal",

We find no evidence that multiple directors shirk their responsibil- ities to serve on board committees. We do not find that multiple directors are associated with a greater likelihood of securities fraud litigation. We conclude that the evidence does not support calls for limits on directorships held by an individual.

Equity Option Trading Changed dramatically with the beginning of vigorous com- petition for order flow in many actively traded options during August 1999; the introduction of payment for order flow soon thereafter; and the launch of the International Securities Exchange in May 2000. Prior to these changes, many actively traded options were listed on only one exchange. For these options, there were no order routing decisions, and interactions between market par- ticipants were governed by one exchange.

    "abstract": "Long payment terms are a strong impediment to the entry and survival of liquidity-constrained ﬁrms. To test this idea and its implications, I consider the eﬀect of a reform restricting the trade credit supply of French trucking ﬁrms. In a diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences setting, I ﬁnd that trucking ﬁrms’ corporate default probability decreases by 25% following the restriction. The eﬀect is persistent, concentrated among liquidity constrained ﬁrms, and not oﬀset by a decrease in proﬁts. The restriction also triggers an increase in the entry of small trucking ﬁrms.

    "title": "Trade Credit, Financial Intermediary Development,",
    "abstract": "Recent work suggests that financial development is important for economic growth, since financial markets more effectively allocate capital to firms with high value projects. For firms in poorly developed financial markets, implicit borrowing in the form of trade credit may provide an alternative source of funds. We show that industries with higher dependence on trade credit finan- cing exhibit higher rates of growth in countries with weaker financial institu- tions. Furthermore, consistent with barriers to trade credit access among young firms, we show that most of the effect that we report comes from growth in the size of preexisting firms. IN Recent Years, there has been increasing interest in the economics literature in the role of financial intermediaries in promoting economic growth. Recent pa- pers have shown that improved financial market development is associated with growth, using a variety of methodologies and data sets.1 One of the basic explana- tions for this pattern is that the financial sector serves to reallocate funds from those with an excess of capital, given their investment opportunities, to those with a shortage of funds (relative to opportunities). Thus, an economy with well- developed financial institutions will be better able to allocate resources to projects that yield the highest returns. This allocative role of financial institutions in promoting development was the focus of Rajan and Zingales (1998), who found that industrial sectors with a great",

    "title": "Trade Generation, Reputation,",
    "abstract": "This paper examines the trade-generation and reputation-building incentives facing sell-side analysts. Using a unique data set I demonstrate that optimistic analysts generate more trade for their brokerage firms, as do high reputation analysts. I also find that accurate analysts generate higher reputations. The analyst therefore faces a conflict between telling the truth to build her reputation versus misleading investors via optimistic forecasts to generate short-term increases in trading commissions. In equilibrium I show forecast optimism can exist, even when investment-banking affil- iations are removed. The conclusions may have important policy implications given recent changes in the institutional structure of the brokerage industry. Significant Media, Regulatory, AND Academic Attention has recently been focused on the conflicts of interest generated by the relationship between sell-side an- alysts and investment-banking departments. One outcome of this controversy wasasettlement between U.S. Regulators and 10 top investment banks requir- (brokerage) firms”. 1 A key assumption underlying this settlement is that split- unbiased earnings estimates and better outcomes for brokerage clients. However, with the introduction of such an institutional structure, the incen- tive for sell-side analysts to generate investment-banking business is simply replaced by the incentive to generate trading commissions.

    "title": "Trade Network Centrality and Currency Risk",
    "abstract": "I uncover an economic source of exposure to global risk that drives international asset prices. Countries that are more central in the global trade network have lower interest rates and currency risk premia. To explain these ﬁndings, I present a general equi- librium model in which central countries’ consumption growth is more exposed to global consumption growth shocks. This causes the currencies of central countries to appreciate in bad times, resulting in lower interest rates and currency risk premia. Empirically, central countries’ consumption growth covaries more with world con- sumption growth, further validating the proposed mechanism. Between 2001 AND 2016, Carry Trade Investors that went long in currencies with high average interest rates, by borrowing in currencies with low average interest rates, obtained an annualized Sharpe ratio of 0.43. This Sharpe ratio is similar to those found in U.S. Equity markets and is surprising given the strategy’s simple, unconditional nature. Although the returns to carry trade strategies are well studied, less is known about their economic origins. In this paper, I show that differences in interest rates that drive currency returns are explained by countries’ trade network centrality, that is, their position in the global trade network. By connecting returns to economic quantities, I shed light on the fundamental origins of exposure to risk that drives international asset prices.

    "title": "Trader Leverage and Liquidity",
    "abstract": "Does trader leverage drive equity market liquidity? We use the unique features of the margin trading system in India to identify a causal relationship between traders’ ability to borrow and a stock’s market liquidity. To quantify the impact of trader leverage, we employ a regression discontinuity design that exploits threshold rules that determine a stock’s margin trading eligibility. We ﬁnd that liquidity is higher when stocks become eligible for margin trading and that this liquidity enhancement is driven by margin traders’ contrarian strategies. Consistent with downward liquidity spirals due to deleveraging, we also ﬁnd that this effect reverses during crises. HOW Does Trader Leverage impact equity market liquidity? The recent ﬁnan- cial crisis has increased interest in the idea that variation in traders’ ability to use leverage (that is, the ability of traders to borrow in order to invest in risky assets) can cause sharp changes in market liquidity. In fact, the assumption that capital constraints drive market liquidity is central to several inﬂuen- tial theoretical models (see, for example, Gromb and Vayanos ( 2002), Garleanu and Pedersen (2007), Brunnermeier and Pedersen ( 2009), Geanakoplos (2010)).

    "abstract": "Utilizing a comprehensive database of transactions in municipal bonds, we investi- gate the volume–volatility relation in the municipal bond market. We find a positive relation between the number of transactions and a bond’s price volatility. In contrast to previous studies, we find a negative relation between average deal size and price volatility. These results are found to be robust throughout the sample. Our results are inconsistent with current theoretical models of the volume–volatility relation. These inconsistencies may arise because current models fail to account for the effects of overall market liquidity on the costs of large transactions. THE Relation Between THE Volume OF Trade in a security and its price volatil- ity has probably always been of interest to market practitioners. More re- cently, with the availability of large databases of individual transactions, the volume–volatility relation has received significant attention from the academic community, as well. Previous studies across a wide range of securities mar- kets, including the markets for corporate equity, financial and commodities futures, and foreign exchange, have documented a positive relation between price volatility and the volume of transactions (see Karpoff (1987) for a re- view of early theoretical and empirical research).

    "abstract": "For years, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accidentally distributed securities disclosures to some investors before the public. We exploit this setting, which is unique because the delay until public disclosure was exogenous and the pri- vate information window was well deﬁned, to study informed trading with a random stopping time. Trading intensity and the pace at which prices incorporate information decrease with the expected delay until public release, but the relation between trad- ing intensity and time elapsed varies with traders’ learning process. Noise trading and relative information advantage play similar roles as in standard microstructure theories assuming a ﬁxed time window. FOR More Than TWO Decades, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has provided investors with access to securities ﬁlings containing market- moving information through its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Re- trieval (edgar) system, which is available through the SEC’s website. And for years, unbeknownst to lawmakers and the public, a small group of private in- vestors were inadvertently given access to these ﬁlings before they were widely released via EDGAR—a government contractor operating a platform known as Robert J.

    "title": "Trading Complex Assets",
    "abstract": "We perform an experimental study to assess the effect of complexity on asset trading. We ﬁnd that higher complexity leads to increased price volatility, lower liquidity, and decreased trade efﬁciency especially when repeated bargaining takes place. However, the channel through which complexity acts is not simply due to the added noise induced by estimation error. Rather, complexity alters the bidding strategies used by traders, making them less inclined to trade, even when we control for estimation error across treatments. As such, it appears that adverse selection plays an important role in explaining the trading abnormalities caused by complexity. Complexity Bounds THE Ability of market participants to accurately value assets. Some assets are easier to analyze (e.g., Treasury bonds), whereas others have unbounded contingencies that prevent agents from pinning down their exact values (e.g., corporate bonds with embedded American options and credit default swaps). Indeed, for many ﬁnancial assets there do not exist closed-form analytical solutions to quantify their value. Moreover, the recent growth of securitization and the use of ﬁner tranches of underlying collateral are likely to exacerbate complexity in the market (e.g., Furﬁne (2011)). The purpose of this paper is to study how complexity affects asset trad- ing, price volatility, liquidity, and trade efﬁciency. Surely complexity increases uncertainty regarding asset values, but it remains unclear what effect this should",

    "abstract": "We study the effect of trading costs on information aggregation and acquisition in ﬁnancial markets. For a given precision of investors’ private information, an irrele- vance result emerges when investors are ex ante identical: price informativeness is independent of the level of trading costs. When investors are ex ante heterogeneous, a change in trading costs can increase or decrease price informativeness, depend- ing on the source of heterogeneity. Our results are valid under quadratic, linear, and ﬁxed costs. Through a reduction in information acquisition, trading costs reduce price informativeness. We discuss how our results inform the policy debate on ﬁnancial transaction taxes/Tobin taxes. Trading IN Financial Markets IS associated with costs whose magnitude varies over time and across space. For instance, technological advances have dramatically reduced the cost of trading in many ﬁnancial markets over recent decades. On the ﬂip side, taxes on ﬁnancial transactions along the lines of To- bin ( 1978) have increased the cost of trading at the margin, and hence are pe- riodically the subject of heated debates. 1 Given that ﬁnancial markets play an essential role in aggregating dispersed information, it is important to under- stand whether changes in the level of trading costs improve or reduce ﬁnancial markets’ ability to aggregate information.

    "abstract": "The effective cost of trading is usually estimated from transaction-level data. This study proposes a Gibbs estimate that is based on daily closing prices. In a validation sample, the daily Gibbs estimate achieves a correlation of 0.965 with the transaction- level estimate. When the Gibbs estimates are incorporated into asset pricing specifi- cations over a long historical sample (1926 to 2006), the results suggest that effective cost (as a characteristic) is positively related to stock returns. The relation is strongest in January, but it appears to be distinct from size effects. Investigations Into THE Role of liquidity and transaction costs in asset pricing must generally confront the fact that while many asset pricing tests make use of U.S. Equity returns from 1926 onward, the high-frequency data used to estimate trading costs are usually not available prior to 1983. Accordingly, most studies either limit the sample to the post-1983 period of common coverage or use the longer historical sample with liquidity proxies estimated from daily data. This paper falls into the latter group. Specifically, I propose a new approach to estimating the effective cost of trading and the common variation in this cost. These estimates are then used in conventional asset pricing specifications with a view to ascertaining the role of trading costs as a characteristic in explaining expected returns.

    "abstract": "Individual investors who hold common stocks directly pay a tremendous perfor- mance penalty for active trading. Of 66,465 households with accounts at a large discount broker during 1991 to 1996, those that trade most earn an annual return of 11.4 percent, while the market returns 17.9 percent. The average household earns an annual return of 16.4 percent, tilts its common stock investment toward high-beta, small, value stocks, and turns over 75 percent of its portfolio annually.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates trading volume before scheduled and unscheduled corporate announcements to explore how traders respond to private information. I show that cumulative trading volume decreases inversely to information asymmetry prior to scheduled announcements, while the opposite relation holds for volume after the announcement. In contrast, trading volume before unscheduled announcements in- creases dramatically and shows little relation to proxies for information asymmetry. I investigate the behavior of market makers and find that they act appropriately by in- creasing price sensitivity before all announcements, implying that they extract timing information from their order books. Trading Volume Plays a critical role in financial markets. It facilitates the price discovery process, enables investors to share financial risks, and ensures that corporations can raise funds needed for investment. Trading volume is gen- erally characterized as either informed or uninformed (liquidity trading). Al- though both types of trading volume are studied in the finance literature, 1 their relative importance remains poorly understood. In this paper, I study trading volume prior to important corporate announcements, when information asym- metry 2 is likely to be the greatest.

    "abstract": "We derive an intertemporal asset pricing model and explore its implications for trading volume and asset returns. We show that investors trade in only two portfolios: the market portfolio, and a hedging portfolio that is used to hedge the risk of changing market conditions. We empirically identify the hedging portfolio using weekly volume and returns data for U.S. Stocks, and then test two of its properties implied by the theory: Its return should be an additional risk factor in explaining the cross section of asset returns, and should also be the best predictor of future market returns. Fundamental Shocks TO THE Economy Drive Both THE Supply and demand of finan- cial assets and their prices. Therefore, any asset pricing model that attempts to establish a structural link between asset prices and underlying economic factors also establishes links between prices and quantities such as trading volume since economic fundamentals such as the investors’ preferences and the assets’ future payoffs determine the joint behavior of prices and quanti- ties. 1 The construction and empirical implementation of any asset pricing model should therefore involve both price and quantity as key elements. Indeed, from a purely empirical perspective, the joint behavior of price and quantity reveals more information about the relation between asset prices and economic factors than do prices alone. The asset pricing literature, however, has focused more on prices and much less on quantities. For exam",

It shows that closures generate rich patterns of time variation in trading and returns, including those consistent with empirical findings: (1) U-shaped patterns in the mean and volatility of returns over trading periods, (2) higher trading activity around the close and open, (3) more volatile open-to-open returns than close-to-close returns, (4) higher returns over trading periods than over nontrading periods, (5) more volatile returns over trading peri- ods than over nontrading periods.

    "abstract": "Does country transparency affect international portfolio investment? We examine this question by constructing new measures of transparency and by making use of a unique microdata set on portfolio holdings of emerging market funds around the world. We distinguish between government and corporate transparency. There is clear evidence that funds systematically invest less in less transparent countries. Moreover, funds have a greater propensity to exit nontransparent countries during crises. THE Merits OF Transparency Have Recently been emphasized in the context of both corporate and government policies. In policy circles, transparency is seen as a way for countries to attract capital, reduce capital market volatility, and lessen the severity of financial crises. For example, it has been argued that during volatile times, international investors may be more likely to rush in and out of opaque countries (see International Monetary Fund (2001)). In the corporate finance context, there is a new literature emphasizing how earn- ings opacity affects equity returns (see, e.g., Bhattacharya, Daouk, and Welker (2003)). There is also some evidence that cross-country differences in corporate governance may be related to economy wide outcomes during financial market crises (Johnson et al. (2000)). This paper examines whether and how the holdings of international in- vestors are affected by country transparency and whether this effect becomes more pronounced during crises. So far, the effect",

    "abstract": "We present a theory of optimal transparency when banks are exposed to rollover risk. Disclosing bank-speciﬁc information enhances the stability of the ﬁnancial system during crises, but has a destabilizing effect in normal economic times. Thus, the reg- ulator optimally increases transparency during crises. Under this policy, however, information disclosure signals a deterioration of economic fundamentals, which gives the regulator ex post incentives to withhold information. This commitment problem precludes a disclosure policy that provides ex ante optimal insurance against aggre- gate shocks, and can result in excess opacity that increases the likelihood of a systemic crisis. Financial Crises ARE Often associated with demands for an increase in the transparency of the ﬁnancial system. Following the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis, reg- ulators have periodically performed and disclosed stress tests on the largest ﬁnancial institutions. This practice has been the subject of much debate, how- ever. For instance, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke cautioned that “when the stress assessment was getting started, some observers had warned that the assessment and, in particular, the public disclosure of the results might back- ﬁre.”1 Moreover, the accuracy and informativeness of these tests have been questioned, emphasizing the credibility issues that regulators face when ad- justing their disclosure policy.

    "title": "Treasury Bill Shortages and the Pricing of",
    "abstract": "We propose a model of post-Great Financial Crisis (GFC) money markets and mon- etary policy implementation. In our framework, capital regulation may deter banks from intermediating liquidity derived from holding reserves to shadow banks. Con- sequently, money markets can be segmented, and the scarcity of Treasury bills avail- able to shadow banks is the main driver of short-term spreads. In this regime, open market operations have an inverse effect on net liquidity provision when swap- ping ample reserves for scarce T-bills or repos. Our model quantitatively accounts for post-2010 time series for repo rates, T-bill yields, and the Fed’s reverse repo facility usage. Before THE Great Financial Crisis (GFC), short-term rates were tightly controlled by the Federal Reserve (Fed) through variations in the supply of scarce reserves available to banks. Since then, the Fed has been implementing an “ample reserve” framework by satiating banks’ demand for reserves and varying the interest it pays on these balances.

    "title": "Treasury Richness",
    "abstract": "We provide estimates of Treasury convenience premia across the entire term struc- ture of Treasury bills, notes, and bonds over more than a quarter of a century and document a variety of key stylized facts about their time-series and cross-sectional patterns. These results raise concerns about the evolving nature of Treasury mar- kets and suggest that investors may now place less weight on the traditional role of Treasury securities as liquid trading vehicles. These stylized facts provide empirical benchmarks that could help guide future theoretical and empirical work about the economics of safe assets in ﬁnancial markets. ONE OF THE Most Important issues in asset pricing is whether investors should be willing to pay a premium above intrinsic fair value for Treasury securities because of their money-like characteristics. This type of premium is often called a convenience premium in the literature and is widely known as Treasury “richness” by market participants. A Treasury security is said to be rich/cheap if its convenience premium is positive/negative. An extensive theoretical literature focuses on convenience premia in Trea- sury markets. This literature can be divided into two contrasting streams. The ﬁrst seeks to explain why Treasuries are rich, while the second seeks to explain why some Treasuries are cheap. On the one hand, the safe-asset literature argues that investors may pay a premium for Treasury securities because of the safety and liquidity Treasuries provide.1",

    "title": "Trends in Corporate Governance",
    "abstract": "The popular press and scholarly studies have noted a number of trends in corpo- rate governance. This article addresses, from a theoretical perspective, whether these trends are linked. And, if so, how? The article finds that a trend toward greater board diligence will lead, sometimes through subtle or indirect mechanisms, to trends to- ward more external candidates becoming CEO, shorter tenures for CEOs, more ef- fort/less perquisite consumption by CEOs (even though such behavior is not directly monitored), and greater CEO compensation. An additional prediction is that, under plausible conditions, externally hired CEOs should have shorter tenures, on average, than internally hired CEOs. THE Corporate Form HAS Existed FOR Centuries . The East India Company, for example, was chartered by Elizabeth I in 1600 (Baskin and Miranti (1997)). One might imagine, given this long history, that the issue of how corporations should be governed would have been settled some time ago. Yet, for nearly as long as corporations have existed, there have been complaints about corporate governance and agitation to improve it (e.g., Smith (1776), p. 700: “Negligence and profusion, therefore, must always prevail, more or less, in the management of the affairs of such compan[ies]”). Moreover, these complaints and agitation have had real effects: Over the centuries, they have led to various changes in corporate law and regulation, including up to the present, with laws such as Sarbanes-Oxley.

    "abstract": "Stocks and other financial assets are traded at prices that lie on a fixed grid determined by the minimum tick size. Observed prices and quoted spreads do not correspond to the equilibrium prices and true spreads that would exist in a market with no minimum tick size. Using Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods, this paper estimates the equilibrium prices and true spreads. For large stocks, most of the quoted spread is attributable to the rounding of prices and the adverse selection component is small. The true spread and the adverse selection component are greater for mid-sized stocks. As A Wedge Between What Buyers PAY and what sellers receive, the bid-ask spread has long interested students of transaction costs. Apart from order processing costs, the market microstructure literature has focused on two main components of the spread: the inventory and the adverse selection costs of trading. Demsetz (1968), Stoll (1978), and Ho and Stoll (1981, 1983) model the inventory holding costs of market makers whereas Copeland and Galai (1983), Glosten and Milgrom (1985), Kyle (1985), and Easley and O'Hara (1987) model the adverse selection costs.

    "title": "Trusting the Stock Market",
    "abstract": "We study the effect that a general lack of trust can have on stock market participation. In deciding whether to buy stocks, investors factor in the risk of being cheated. The perception of this risk is a function of the objective characteristics of the stocks and the subjective characteristics of the investor. Less trusting individuals are less likely to buy stock and, conditional on buying stock, they will buy less. In Dutch and Italian micro data, as well as in cross-country data, we find evidence consistent with lack of trust being an important factor in explaining the limited participation puzzle. THE Decision TO Invest IN stocks requires not only an assessment of the risk– return trade-off given the existing data, but also an act of faith (trust) that the data in our possession are reliable and that the overall system is fair. Episodes like the collapse of Enron may change not only the distribution of expected pay- offs, but also the fundamental trust in the system that delivers those payoffs. Most of us will not enter a three-card game played on the street, even after ob- serving a lot of rounds (and thus getting an estimate of the “true” distribution of payoffs). The reason is that we do not trust the fairness of the game (and the person playing it). In this paper, we claim that for many people, especially people unfamiliar with finance, the stock market is not intrinsically different from the three-card game. They need to have trust in the fairness of the game and in",

    "abstract": "We examine whether firms belonging to Korean business groups (chaebols) benefit from acquisitions they make or whether such acquisitions provide a way for con- trolling shareholders to increase their wealth by increasing the value of other group firms (tunneling). We find that when a chaebol-affiliated firm makes an acquisi- tion, its stock price on average falls. While minority shareholders of a chaebol- affiliated firm making an acquisition lose, the controlling shareholder of that firm on average benefits because the acquisition enhances the value of other firms in the group. This evidence is consistent with the tunneling hypothesis. Recent Empirical Evidence Suggests that business groups in developing coun- tries can facilitate efficient allocation of capital and managerial resources. Khanna and Palepu (1997, 2000) argue that business groups in developing countries mimic the beneficial functions of market mechanisms that are present only in advanced economies. When a particular market mechanism is not well developed or accessible, a business group can add value by providing member firms with alternative means of overcoming problems. For example, when a country's external cap- ital market is not well developed, the operation of an internal capital market within a business group enables those firms with the best projects within the group to obtain resources.1 However, the structure of diversified business groups may create agency problems.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates risk-taking in the liquid portfolios held by a large panel of Swedish twins. We document that the portfolio share invested in risky assets is an increasing and concave function of ﬁnancial wealth, leading to different risk sensi- tivities across investors. Human capital, which we estimate directly from individual labor income, also affects risk-taking positively, while internal habit and expenditure commitments tend to reduce it. Our microﬁndings lend strong support to decreas- ing relative risk aversion and habit formation preferences. Furthermore, heteroge- neous risk sensitivities across investors help reconcile individual preferences with representative-agent models. HOW Does THE Asset allocation of individual investors depend on their main ﬁnancial and demographic characteristics? Portfolio choice theory provides nor- mative answers to this question under a wide range of risk preferences and ﬁ- nancial circumstances (see, for example, Campbell and Viceira (2002)). Among the many mechanisms investigated in the literature, the relation between risk- taking and wealth is of primary importance because it distinguishes constant relative risk aversion (crra) utility from increasingly popular alternatives.

    "abstract": "We estimate the effects of deregulation of U.S. Banking restrictions on interstate per- sonal income insurance for the period 1970 to 2001. Interstate income insurance occurs when personal income reacts less than one-to-one to state-specific output shocks. We find that insurance improved after banking deregulation, with a larger effect in states where small businesses are more important and on proprietors’ income than on other components of personal income. Our explanation centers on the role of banks as a prime source of small business finance and on the close intertwining of the personal and business finances of small business owners. Since THE 1970S, THE Structure OF THE U.S. Banking industry has changed con- siderably following the deregulation of restrictions on branching and interstate banking. The ensuing wave of consolidation has increased the average bank’s size and allowed banks to expand into new geographical markets by operat- ing larger branch networks or bank holding companies. Because banks play a central role in the allocation of capital in the economy and are the prime source of finance to small businesses, we examine if these changes in bank market structure have had real effects for small business owners. 1 In partic- ular, we examine whether interstate personal income insurance is higher af- ter deregulation, where by income insurance, we refer to the extent to which, ∗Yuliya Demyanyk is at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.

    "title": "Uncertainty about Government Policy and Stock",
    "abstract": "We analyze how changes in government policy affect stock prices. Our general equilib- rium model features uncertainty about government policy and a government whose decisions have both economic and noneconomic motives. The model makes numerous empirical predictions. Stock prices should fall at the announcement of a policy change, on average. The price decline should be large if uncertainty about government policy is large, and also if the policy change is preceded by a short or shallow economic down- turn. Policy changes should increase volatilities and correlations among stocks. The jump risk premium associated with policy decisions should be positive, on average. Governments Shape THE Environment in which the private sector operates. They affect ﬁrms in many ways: for instance, by levying taxes, providing subsi- dies, enforcing laws, regulating competition, and deﬁning environmental poli- cies. In short, governments set the rules of the game. Governments change these rules from time to time, eliciting price reactions in ﬁnancial markets. These reactions are weak if the change is widely antic- ipated, but they can be strong if the markets are caught by surprise. This paper analyzes the effects of changes in government policy on stock prices in a theoretical setting. Naturally, policy changes are not exogenous; they are deter- mined by various economic and political forces. To account for this endogeneity, we develop a simple asset pricing model in which the government plays",

    "abstract": "I construct an equilibrium model that captures salient properties of index option prices, equity returns, variance, and the risk-free rate. A representative investor makes consumption and portfolio choice decisions that are robust to his uncertainty about the true economic model. He pays a large premium for index options because they hedge important model misspeciﬁcation concerns, particularly concerning jump shocks to cash ﬂow growth and volatility. A calibration shows that empirically con- sistent fundamentals and reasonable model uncertainty explain option prices and the variance premium. Time variation in uncertainty generates variance premium ﬂuctuations, helping explain their power to predict stock returns. Knightian Uncertainty — Ambiguity About the true model governing fundamentals—can be an important factor inﬂuencing investors’ consumption and portfolio choice decisions. Incorporating it into asset pricing models can therefore shed light on sources of asset return premiums and time variation in prices. In this paper, I construct an equilibrium model with a representative investor who has model uncertainty that varies in intensity over time.1 A cali- bration of this model is shown to capture a broad set of features of equity and equity index option prices. In particular, the model generates two prominent features of index options that represent a challenge to equilibrium models: (i) the large premium embedded in their prices, called the variance premium, and (ii) the",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the “conﬁdential holdings” of institutional investors, especially hedge funds, where the quarter-end equity holdings are disclosed with a delay through amendments to Form 13F and are usually excluded from the standard databases. Funds managing large risky portfolios with nonconventional strategies seek conﬁ- dentiality more frequently. Stocks in these holdings are disproportionately associated with information-sensitive events or share characteristics indicating greater informa- tion asymmetry. Conﬁdential holdings exhibit superior performance up to 12 months, and tend to take longer to build. Together the evidence supports private information and the associated price impact as the dominant motives for conﬁdentiality. Mandatory Disclosure OF Holdings in public companies by investors is an essential part of securities market regulation. At the core of this regulation is Section 13(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which requires institu- tional investment managers to disclose their quarterly portfolio holdings.

We document a posi- tive effect of effort on unexpected earnings and cumulative abnormal returns follow- ing earnings announcements, and a reduction in credit default swap spreads. This is robust to using exogenous weather patterns as an instrument. Long-short, calendar- time effort portfolios earn signiﬁcant average daily returns. Finally, we revisit impor- tant agency issues from the literature. THE Moral Hazard Problem DUE to hidden effort is ubiquitous but is hard to study empirically.

    "title": "Uncovering the Risk–Return Relation",
    "abstract": "There is ongoing debate about the apparent weak or negative relation between risk (conditional variance) and expected returns in the aggregate stock market. We de- velop and estimate an empirical model based on the intertemporal capital asset pric- ing model (icapm) that separately identifies the two components of expected returns, namely, the risk component and the component due to the desire to hedge changes in investment opportunities. The estimated coefficient of relative risk aversion is posi- tive, statistically significant, and reasonable in magnitude. However, expected returns are driven primarily by the hedge component. The omission of this component is partly responsible for the existing contradictory results. THE Return ON THE Market Portfolio plays a central role in the capital asset pricing model (capm), the financial theory widely used by both academics and practitioners. However, the intertemporal properties of stock market returns are not yet fully understood. 1 In particular, there is ongoing debate in the liter- ature about the relation between stock market risk and return, and the extent to which stock market volatility moves stock prices. This paper provides new evidence on the risk–return relation by estimating a variant of Merton’s (1973) intertemporal capital asset pricing model (icapm). In his seminal paper, Merton (1973) shows that the conditional excess market return, E t−1rM,t − rf,t−1, is a linear function of its conditional variance, σ2 M,t−1, (th",

    "title": "Underreaction to Dividend Reductions",
    "abstract": "Using a sample of 2,337 cash dividend reduction or omission announcements over the 1927 to 1999 period, this study reports significant negative post-announcement long-term abnormal returns, which last 1 year only. However, this long-term abnormal performance is driven by the post-earnings-announcement drift. After controlling for the earnings performance and the skewness of buy-and-hold abnormal returns, there is no compelling evidence of a post-dividend-reduction or post-dividend-omission price drift. A number of studies present evidence of long-term return anomalies following major corporate events that call into question the informational efficiency of capital markets. In particular, these studies demonstrate that announcement- period abnormal stock returns for various events are not unbiased revisions in investors’ expectations. 1 Fama (1998) reviews this evidence and concludes that these seemingly puzzling findings are the result of chance, or incorrect statistical method, or a misspecified expected return model. 2 In particular, in his review of the paper by Michaely, Thaler, and Womack (1995), who report a stock price underreaction in samples of 561 dividend initiation and 887 dividend omission announcements made over the 1964 to 1988 period, Fama contends that changing the matching criteria might tell a different story, and hence he calls for an out-of-sample test before drawing any inferences about long-term returns following changes in dividend payments.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates options market reaction to changes in the instantaneous variance of the underlying asset. There are three main findings. First, options market investors underreact to individual daily changes in instantaneous vari- ance. Second, these same investors overreact to periods of mostly increasing or mostly decreasing daily changes in instantaneous variance. Third, they tend to underreact (overreact) to current daily changes in instantaneous variance that are preceded mostly by daily changes of the opposite (same) sign. The third finding can reconcile the first two and is also consistent with well-established cognitive biases. THE Existence AND Nature of predictable investor misreaction to information is a central concern of financial economists. Recently, one focus of this con- cern has been a body of stock market studies that can be interpreted as indicating that stock market investors underreact to information over short horizons and overreact to information over long horizons (see Chapters 1 and 5 of Shleifer (2000) for a review of the stock market studies that advo- cates this interpretation). Some researchers have accepted this interpreta- tion and embraced the challenge of building theoretical models that provide a unified explanation of short-horizon underreaction and long-horizon over- reaction (Barberis, Shleifer, and Vishny (1998) (henceforth, BSV), Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam (1998), Hong and Stein (1999)).

    "abstract": "Based on a novel high-frequency data set for a large number of ﬁrms, I estimate the time-varying latent continuous and jump factors that explain individual stock returns. The factors are estimated using principal component analysis applied to a local volatility and jump covariance matrix. I ﬁnd four stable continuous systematic factors, which can be well approximated by a market, oil, ﬁnance, and electricity portfolio, while there is only one stable jump market factor. The exposure of stocks to these risk factors and their explained variation is time-varying. The four continuous factors carry an intraday risk premium that reverses overnight. ONE OF THE Most POPULARmethods for modeling systematic risk is estimation of factor models—ﬁnding the “right” systematic factors has become the central question of asset pricing. I contribute to our understanding about systematic risk by shedding light on the following three questions: (i) what are the factors that explain the systematic comovement in individual stocks, (ii) how does the systematic factor structure for stocks change over time, and (iii) what are the asset pricing implications of the systematic factors? To do so, the approach that I follow has three key elements: First, rather than using a prespeciﬁed (and potentially misspeciﬁed) set of factors, I estimate the statistical factors, which can explain most of the common comovement in a large cross section of stock returns. Second, I use high-frequency data which allow me to",

    "abstract": "When unscheduled news arrives, investors react with a stochastic delay yet still may exploit new information. In this context, I study the equilibrium dynamics of limit order markets. Continuous idiosyncratic liquidity shocks result in trades on both sides of the order book. News therefore arrives at random times. Following news, order ﬂows become unbalanced and market depth is consumed, leading to positive covariance between price variability, trading volume, and order book unbalances. Holding the unconditional price variability constant, news frequency has a negative effect on both market depth and the variability-volume covariance. IN Modern Financial Markets , Most stocks, as well as bonds and derivatives, are traded via electronic limit order books. In such a trading venue, any par- ticipant can provide new quotes, with limit orders, or trade against existing ones, with market orders. Limit orders allow the investor to improve the exe- cution price but potentially expose her to a winner’s curse problem when public information arrives. In this paper I explore what underlies the placement of limit and market orders when information is released, at random times, by unscheduled news (e.g., on Bloomberg, Reuters Newswire, etc.). I also exam- ine how news arrivals, and their frequency, impact market liquidity, trading volume, and volatility. This paper is the ﬁrst to tackle these questions in the context of an equilibrium model in which all agents are rational and can use full",

    "title": "Unshrouding: Evidence from Bank Overdrafts",
    "abstract": "Lower prices produce higher demand . . . Or do they? A bank’s direct marketing to holders of “free” checking accounts shows that a large discount on 60% APR over- drafts reduces overdraft usage, especially when bundled with a discount on debit card or autodebit transactions. In contrast, messages mentioning overdraft availability without mentioning price increase usage. Neither change persists long after the mes- sages stop. These results do not square easily with classical models of consumer choice and ﬁrm competition. Instead, they support behavioral models where consumers un- derestimate and are inattentive to overdraft costs, and ﬁrms respond by shrouding overdraft prices in equilibrium. Many Business Models IN Financial services and other industries rely on expen- sive add-ons that are tied to base goods. Examples include expensive overdraft credit (add-on) tied to a “free” checking account (base good), back-end man- agement fees tied to “free” investment advice, printer cartridges and printers, luggage fees and airline tickets, and dealer-supplied maintenance and auto- mobiles. A closely related practice is overage/penalty pricing. Businesses with such revenue models typically focus their marketing and competitive strategy on the base good, even though add-ons/overages can be critical revenue sources. Retail banking provides a striking example: banks often market checking accounts as free, even though many consumers end up paying high fees for overdraft credit. 1 Govern",

    "title": "Unspanned Stochastic Volatility: Evidence",
    "abstract": "Most existing dynamic term structure models assume that interest rate derivatives are redundant securities and can be perfectly hedged using solely bonds. We find that the quadratic term structure models have serious difficulties in hedging caps and cap straddles, even though they capture bond yields well. Furthermore, at-the-money straddle hedging errors are highly correlated with cap-implied volatilities and can explain a large fraction of hedging errors of all caps and straddles across moneyness and maturities. Our results strongly suggest the existence of systematic unspanned factors related to stochastic volatility in interest rate derivatives markets. Interest Rate Caps AND Swaptions are among the most widely traded interest rate derivatives in the world. According to the Bank for International Settle- ments, their combined notional value has been more than 10 trillion dollars in recent years, which is many times larger than that of exchange-traded op- tions. Because of the size of these markets, accurate and efficient pricing and hedging of caps and swaptions have enormous practical importance. Prices of interest rate derivatives may also contain richer information about term struc- ture dynamics than bond yields or swap rates. Over the last decade, a huge literature (both theoretical and empirical) on multifactor dynamic term struc- ture models (hereafter DTSMs) has been developed. 1 While numerous studies have fit these models to bond yields or swap rates, their perf",

    "abstract": "This paper directly tests the hypothesis that upstairs intermediation lowers ad- verse selection cost. We find upstairs market makers effectively screen out information-motivated orders and execute large liquidity-motivated orders at a lower cost than the downstairs market. Upstairs markets do not cannibalize or free ride off the downstairs market. In one-quarter of the trades, the upstairs market offers price improvement over the limit orders available in the consolidated limit order book. Trades are more likely to be executed upstairs at times when liquidity is lower in the downstairs market. This Paper Examines THE Extent to which upstairs market makers, who know the identity of parties submitting orders, route orders based on perceived information content. The paper also investigates whether the upstairs mar- ket cannibalizes or free rides off the downstairs market. The recent explosive growth of Electronic Communications Networks (ECNs) and other anonymous order entry systems, such as Island and Instinet, raises the question of the role and importance of an upstairs market. As discussed in Harris (1993), off-market activities potentially impose a number of exter- nalities on public exchanges. These can make it difficult to enforce second- ary precedence rules. For example, in the downstairs market, orders are generally matched first on the basis of price and second on the basis of time of arrival. However, as orders received in the upstairs market do not have to be submi",

    "abstract": "We ﬁnd that a ﬁrm’s investment is highly sensitive to the investments of other ﬁrms headquartered nearby, even those in very different industries. A ﬁrm’s investment also responds to ﬂuctuations in the cash ﬂows and stock prices (q) of local ﬁrms outside its sector. These patterns do not appear to reﬂect exogenous area shocks such as local shocks to labor or real estate values, but rather suggest that local agglomeration economies are important determinants of ﬁrm investment and growth. Twenty-five Years AGO, Detroit-based Unisys was the second largest computer company in the United States, and Whole Foods was still a ﬂedging organic grocer, with scarcely a presence beyond its headquarters in Austin, Texas. Since that time, it would be hard to ﬁnd cities with more different trajecto- ries. Austin’s population has exploded, while Detroit has suffered population declines, the departure of key employers, and increased crime. 1 Meanwhile, Whole Foods has grown to become an industry leader in the grocery business, with Unisys reduced to a bit player, having twice ﬂirted with bankruptcy in recent years. Urban economists have long explored the connection between location and economic variables, ﬁnding large differences in, for example, worker wages and productivity rates across geographic areas.

    "abstract": "We conduct a study in which subjects trade stocks in an experimental market while we measure their brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging. All of the subjects trade in a suboptimal way. We use the neural data to test a “realization utility” explanation for their behavior. We ﬁnd that activity in two areas of the brain that are important for economic decision-making exhibit activity consistent with the predictions of realization utility. These results provide support for the realization utility model. More generally, they demonstrate that neural data can be helpful in testing models of investor behavior. Over THE Past 20 years, economists have accumulated a large amount of evi- dence on how individual investors manage their ﬁnancial portfolios over time. Some of this evidence is puzzling, in the sense that it is hard to reconcile with the simplest models of rational trading (Barberis and Thaler (2003), Campbell (2006)). Theorists have responded to this challenge by constructing new mod- els of investor behavior. Empiricists, in turn, have started testing these newly developed models. Most of the empirical work that tests theories of investor behavior uses ﬁeld data (Barber and Odean (2000), Barber and Odean ( 2001), Choi et al. (2009), Grinblatt and Keloharju (2009)).

We model platforms where buyers and sellers can meet to exchange services. Tokens serve as the sole medium of exchange on a platform and can be traded in a secondary market. Tokenizing a platform commits a ﬁrm to give up monopolistic rents associ- ated with the control of the platform, leading to long-run competitive prices. We show how the threat of entrants can incentivize developers to tokenize and discuss cases where regulation is needed to enforce tokenization. Financial Technology (fintech ) IS Promising to revolutionize the ﬁnance world. A key element in this vision is decentralization, which aims to break the market power of ﬁnancial intermediaries and other large play- ers in the ﬁnancial industry . However, while FinTech focuses on increasing competition, the rise of technology in the economy at large is generating concerns about greater concentration of market power.

    "title": "Valuation Risk and Asset Pricing",
    "abstract": "Standard representative-agent models fail to account for the weak correlation be- tween stock returns and measurable fundamentals, such as consumption and output growth. This failing, which underlies virtually all modern asset pricing puzzles, arises because these models load all uncertainty onto the supply side of the economy. We propose a simple theory of asset pricing in which demand shocks play a central role. These shocks give rise to valuation risk that allows the model to account for key asset pricing moments, such as the equity premium, the bond term premium, and the weak correlation between stock returns and fundamentals. IN Standard Representative-agent Asset pricing models, the expected return to an asset reﬂects the covariance between the asset’s payoff and the agent’s stochastic discount factor (SDF). An important challenge to these models is that the correlation and covariance between stock returns and measurable fundamentals, especially consumption growth, is weak at both short and long horizons. Cochrane and Hansen (1992), Campbell and Cochrane (1999), and Cochrane (2001) call this phenomenon thecorrelation puzzle. More recently, Lettau and Ludvigson (2011) document this puzzle using different methods. According to their estimates, the shock that accounts for the vast majority of asset price ﬂuctuations is uncorrelated with consumption at virtually all horizons. The basic disconnect between measurable macroeconomic fundamentals and stock returns underlies virt",

    "title": "Valuation and Control in Venture Finance",
    "abstract": "This paper presents the model of a relationship between a venture capitalist and an entrepreneur engaged in the formation of a new firm. I assume that the entre- preneur derives private nonpecuniary benefits from having some control over the firm. I show that to separate the entrepreneur's value of control from the firm's expected payoff, the venture capitalist demands disproportionately higher control rights than the size of his equity investment. The entrepreneur is compensated for a greater loss of control through better terms of financing, ability to extract higher rents from asymmetric information, and improved risk sharing. Venture Capital Firms often finance projects which, at the time of funding, have neither revenues nor even a product in existence. However, by using an intricate system of control rights, venture capitalists can overcome many failures inevitable in a complex task of converting entrepreneurial talent into companies, products, and markets. There are three main facts about the allocation of control rights between venture capitalists and entrepreneurs. First, the degree of control acquired by venture capitalists is disproportionately large compared to what they would have received under the \"one share one vote rule\" (see Sahlman (1990), Go- mpers (1997), and Black and Gilson (1998)). Second, control is not an indi- visible right held at any one time by either an investor or an entrepreneur, but rather a continuous variable that is adjusted and fine-tuned",

    "title": "Valuation of the Debt Tax Shield",
    "abstract": "In this study, we use cross-sectional regressions to estimate the value of the debt tax shield. Recognizing that debt is correlated with the value of operations along nontax dimensions, we estimate reverse regressions in which we regress future profitability on firm value and debt rather than regressing firm value on debt and profitability. Reversing the regressions mitigates bias and facilitates the use of market information to control for differences in risk and expected growth. Our estimated value for the debt tax shield is approximately 40 percent (10 percent) of debt balances (firm value), net of the personal tax disadvantage of debt. THE Debt TAX Shield HAS Stimulated decades of debate regarding firm valua- tion and the cost of capital. In 1963, Modigliani and Miller (hereafter MM) first hypothesized that the tax benefits of debt increase firm value and de- crease the cost of using debt capital. In 1977, Miller countered that firms pass out the tax benefits of debt to creditors through high interest rates to compensate them for the personal tax disadvantage of debt. Others have proposed that the financial distress costs of debt offset at least some of the tax benefits (see, e.g., DeAngelo and Masulis, 1980). A priori, therefore, the firm valuation and capital structure implications of the debt tax shield are unclear, so empirical investigation is required. Empirical investigation of the debt tax shield has followed three primary lines of inquiry. First, many studies inv",

Value and momentum returns correlate more strongly across asset classes than passive exposures to the asset classes, but value and momentum are negatively correlated with each other, both within and across asset classes. Our results indicate the pres- ence of common global risks that we characterize with a three-factor model. Global funding liquidity risk is a partial source of these patterns, which are identiﬁable only when examining value and momentum jointly across markets. Our ﬁndings present a challenge to existing behavioral, institutional, and rational asset pricing theories that largely focus on U.S. Equities. TWO OF THE MOSTstudied capital market phenomena are the relation between an asset’s return and the ratio of its “long-run” (or book) value relative to its current market value, termed the “value” effect, and the relation between an asset’s return and its recent relative performance history, termed the “mo- mentum” effect. The returns to value and momentum strategies have become central to the market efﬁciency debate and the focal points of asset pricing stud- ies, generating numerous competing theories for their existence.

We examine the propensity of these strategies to generate statistically and economically significant profits due to our familiarity with the data. Under plausible assumptions, data snooping can account for up to 50 percent of the in-sample relations between firm characteristics and returns uncovered using single (one-way) sorts. The biases can be much larger if we simultaneously condition returns on two (or more) characteristics. THE Debate Around THE Empirical Support for the one-factor Capital Asset Pricing Model (capm) in explaining the cross section of expected returns of financial in part, been given theoretical validity by both the intertemporal version of the Capm (see, e.g., Merton (1973)) and the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (see Ross (1976), Connor (1984)). However, with little guidance from theory on the identity of the \"factors\" that determine returns, for the most part, the goal of this litera- ture is the discovery of multiple characteristics, such as \"value\" versus \"glamour,\" that are statistically related to asset returns. The resurgence of this literature started about two decades ago with tests by Banz (1981) and Reinganum (1981) that use firm size, in addition to a firm's beta, to explain the cross section of required returns on equity.

    "abstract": "We document a robust cross-sectional positive association across industries between a measure of the economic efficiency of corporate investment and the magnitude of firm- specific variation in stock returns. This finding is interesting for two reasons, neither of which is a priori obvious. First, it adds further support to the view that firm-specific return variation gauges the extent to which information about the firm is quickly and accurately reflected in share prices. Second, it can be interpreted as evidence that more informative stock prices facilitate more efficient corporate investment. Corporate Capital Investment should be more efficient where stock prices are more informative. Informed stock prices convey meaningful signals to manage- ment about the quality of their decisions. They also convey meaningful signals to the financial markets about the need to intervene when management de- cisions are poor. Corporate governance mechanisms, such as shareholder law- suits, executive options, institutional investor pressure, and the market for corporate control, depend on stock prices. Where stock prices are more infor- mative, these mechanisms induce better corporate governance—which includes more efficient capital investment decisions.

It then values the strips using an asset pricing model that captures the risk in the cross-section of bonds and equity factors. The method delivers a risk-adjusted proﬁt on each PE investment and a time series for the expected return on each fund category . We ﬁnd negative risk-adjusted proﬁts for the average PE fund, with sub- stantial heterogeneity and some persistence in the performance. Expected returns and risk-adjusted proﬁt decline in the later part of the sample. Private Equity Investments Have Risen in importance over the past 25 years. In contrast, the number of publicly listed ﬁrms has been falling since 1997, especially among smaller ﬁrms. Private equity (PE) funds account for $5.8 trillion in assets under management (AUM), and raised nearly $800 billion in new capital in 2018 alone (Bökberg et al. (2019)).

    "abstract": "We study asset allocation when the conditional moments of returns are partly predictable. Rather than first model the return distribution and subsequently char- acterize the portfolio choice, we determine directly the dependence of the optimal portfolio weights on the predictive variables. We combine the predictors into a single index that best captures time variations in investment opportunities. This index helps investors determine which economic variables they should track and, more importantly, in what combination. We consider investors with both expected utility (mean variance and Crra) and nonexpected utility (ambiguity aversion and prospect theory) objectives and characterize their market timing, horizon ef- fects, and hedging demands. There IS BY NOW Ample Evidence in the literature that the means, variances, covariances, and higher order moments of stock and bond returns are time- varying and predictable. However, it has proven difficult to translate this evi- dence of predictability into practical portfolio advice because the different moments of returns, which in turn determine the optimal portfolio weights, are typically predicted by different sets of economic variables. Perhaps because of this difficulty with modeling the conditional return distribution, most professional investment advice is given solely on the basis of variables that forecast expected returns, such as the dividend yield or the slope of the term structure.1 Looking beyond expected returns, it is",

    "abstract": "I show that venture capitalists’ motivation to build reputation can have beneﬁcial effects in the primary market, mitigating information frictions and helping ﬁrms go public. Because uninformed reputation-motivated venture capitalists want to appear informed, they are biased against backing ﬁrms—by not backing ﬁrms, they avoid taking low-value ﬁrms to market, which would ultimately reveal their lack of infor- mation. In equilibrium, reputation-motivated venture capitalists back relatively few bad ﬁrms, creating a certiﬁcation effect that mitigates information frictions. However, they also back relatively few good ﬁrms, and thus, reputation motivation decreases welfare when good ﬁrms are abundant or proﬁtable. Delegated Investors Wish TO BE perceived as skilled in order to generate “ﬂows,” that is, to attract new investors and retain existing ones. This motiva- tion to build a reputation for being skilled can distort their trades in secondary markets. For example, delegated investors may trade too much in an attempt to appear informed, even when they are not. Such excessive portfolio churning can decrease secondary market efﬁciency (Dow and Gorton ( 1997), Dasgupta and Prat ( 2006, 2008), Guerrieri and Kondor ( 2012)). However, delegated in- vestors play an important role not only in secondary markets, where their trading behavior affects market efﬁciency, but also in primary markets, where their investment behavior affects real efﬁciency.

    "abstract": "This paper examines venture capital’s (VC) role in the geographic clustering of high- growth startups. We exploit a rule change that disproportionately impacted U.S. Re- gions that historically lacked VC ﬁnancing via a restriction of banks to invest in the asset class. A one-standard-deviation increase in VCs’ exposure to the rule led to a 20% decline in fund size and a 10% decrease in the likelihood of raising a follow-on fund. Startups were not wholly cushioned: ﬁnancing and valuations declined. Star- tups also moved out of impacted states after the rule change, likely exacerbating existing geographic disparity in entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship AND Innovation IN THE United States are geograph- ically concentrated (Chen et al. ( 2010), Chatterji, Glaeser, and Kerr ( 2014), Chattergoon and Kerr ( 2022)). The concentration of entrepreneurial activi- ties has important implications for economic performance and regional de- velopment, which has motivated many federal and local policies (Saxenian (1994), Lerner ( 2012)). These policies include place-based programs, direct in- vestments, grants, subsidized loans, education, and tax breaks (e.g., Chatterji, Glaeser, and Kerr ( 2014)).

    "abstract": "This paper examines the impact venture capital can have on the development of new firms. Using a hand-collected data set on Silicon Valley start-ups, we find that venture capital is related to a variety of professionalization measures, such as human resource policies, the adoption of stock option plans, and the hiring of a marketing VP. Venture-capital-backed companies are also more likely and faster to replace the founder with an outside CEO, both in situations that appear adversar- ial and those mutually agreed to. The evidence suggests that venture capitalists play roles over and beyond those of traditional financial intermediaries. IN This Paper, WE SET OUT to empirically examine whether venture capitalists play a role in the professionalization of start-up companies. We use a unique hand-collected data set of Silicon Valley start-ups that allows us to observe aspects of the internal organization of firms. We find that venture capital- ists play a role at the top of the organization, in terms of replacing the original founders with an outside CEO. Moreover they seem to influence developments further down the organization, in terms of playing a role for the introduction of stock option plans, the hiring of a VP of sales and mar- keting, and the formulation of human resource policies. Traditional financial intermediation theory tends to focus on information- based roles of financial intermediaries, dealing with the alleviation of moral hazard or adverse selection (Diamond (",

    "abstract": "Contrary to conventional wisdom, we document that approximately 15% of venture capitalist (VC)-backed ﬁrms raise additional capital from VCs in the ﬁve years af- ter going public. We propose two explanations for why ﬁrms revert to VC ﬁnancing post-IPO (initial public offering). First, we hypothesize that VC participation in post- IPO ﬁnancing represents an efﬁcient solution to informational problems that would otherwise constrain ﬁrms’ abilities to exploit value-increasing investments. Analy- ses of ﬁrm and VC characteristics, together with the ﬁnding that these investments are value-increasing for both VCs and the underlying companies, support this hy- pothesis. We ﬁnd no support for the alternative that agency conﬂicts motivate these investments. A Large Body OF Literature documents that venture capitalists (VCs) focus on young private companies, generally in high-tech industries. As Metrick and Yasuda (2011) succinctly state, “A VC invests only in private companies. . . . A VC’s primary goal is to maximize its ﬁnancial return by exiting investments through a sale or an initial public offering (IPO).” We show, however, that these same investors fund companies after the IPO as well. In a sample of private ﬁrms that go public for the ﬁrst time, 15% of the ﬁrms backed by VC ﬁnancing prior to the IPO received additional funding from VCs within the ﬁrst ﬁve years after the IPO. Approximately half of these post-IPO VC ﬁnancings were from the same VC that funded the company prior",

    "abstract": "The stylized fact that volatility is not priced in individual equity options does not withstand scrutiny . First, we show that the average return of heavily traded deep out-of-the-money call options on stocks is−116 basis points per day . Second, Fama- MacBeth estimates of the volatility risk premium in stock options are similar to those in S&P 500 Index call options. Third, the mean return of heavily traded delta-hedged at-the-money calls (puts) is−23 (−30) basis points. Fourth, the variance risk pre- mium in stock options is negative. Our analysis highlights the importance of mi- crostructure biases and robustness in empirical work with options. Determining Whether Volatility IS Priced has important consequences for interpreting implied volatilities and understanding the purpose of equity option markets. A volatility risk premium means that implied volatilities, whether they are derived from the Black-Scholes (1973) model or the model- free approach of Carr and Madan (2001) and Britten-Jones and Neuberger (2000), cannot be interpreted as unbiased forecasts of future realized volatility . Furthermore, knowing whether a volatility risk premium exists has important implications for understanding the purpose of options markets, in particular, the extent to which they can be seen as markets for volatility risk. Though understanding whether volatility is priced is a central issue in the option literature, the evidence is somewhat mixed. While both Coval and Shumway (2001) and Bak",

    "abstract": "This study employs a new data set from art auctions to examine the relationship be- tween auctioneer presale price estimates and the long-term performance of artworks. We find that the price estimates for expensive paintings have a consistent upward bias over a long period of 30 years. High estimates at the time of purchase are as- sociated with adverse subsequent abnormal returns. Moreover, the estimation error for individual paintings tends to persist over time. These results are consistent with the view that auction house price estimates are affected by agency problems and that some investors are credulous. Rationality HAS Long Been A KEY Assumption of much of modern economics. Given its importance, numerous studies recently have examined its empirical valid- ity and have discovered some evidence of bounded rationality or information inefficiency. For example, in behavioral finance, several studies have provided evidence suggesting that investors on average do not discount sufficiently the incentives of interested parties, such as firms, brokers, and analysts, to ma- nipulate the information they provide. Womack (1996) found that securities analysts are biased in their forecasts and recommendations. Stock recommen- dations favor buys over sells. Capstaff, Paudyal, and Rees (1998) also discovered that earnings forecasts are generally optimistic, especially at long time hori- zons.

When consumption is more salient than nonconsumption, people perceive that others are consuming heavily , and infer that future prospects are favorable. This increases ag- gregate consumption in a positive feedback loop. A distinctive implication is that disclosure policy interventions can ameliorate undersaving. In contrast with wealth- signaling models, information asymmetry about wealthreduces overconsumption.

    "title": "Volatility Expectations and Returns",
    "abstract": "We provide evidence that agents have slow-moving beliefs about stock market volatil- ity that lead to initial underreaction to volatility shocks followed by delayed overre- action. These dynamics are mirrored in the VIX and variance risk premiums, which reﬂect investor expectations about volatility, and are also supported in both surveys and ﬁrm-level option prices. We embed these expectations into an asset pricing model and ﬁnd that the model can account for a number of stylized facts about market re- turns and return volatility that are difﬁcult to reconcile, including a weak or even negative risk-return trade-off. Agents ’perceptions OF Risk Play a critical role in asset pricing models. However, a long literature ﬁnds that the empirical risk-return trade-off is weak at best (Glosten, Jagannathan, and Runkle (1993)), despite this trade-off being strong in leading asset pricing models (Moreira and Muir (2017)).1 This paper proposes a model in which a representative agent has biased, slow-moving expectations about volatility. We show that these expectations help explain a weak relation between risk and returns. We discipline expectations about volatility in the model in three ways: we microfound beliefs based on sticky and extrapolative expectations (which have been shown to be present in many other contexts), we use survey data to directly assess agents’ expectations of of Economics, Maastricht, Nova, Amsterdam, and Stanford, as well as Andy Atkeson, Nick Bar- beris, John Ca",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates informed trading on stock volatility in the option market. We construct non-market maker net demand for volatility from the trading volume of individual equity options and find that this demand is informative about the future realized volatility of underlying stocks. We also find that the impact of volatility de- mand on option prices is positive. More importantly, the price impact increases by 40% as informational asymmetry about stock volatility intensifies in the days leading up to earnings announcements and diminishes to its normal level soon after the volatility uncertainty is resolved. THE Last Several Decades have witnessed astonishing growth in the market for derivatives. The market’s current size of $200 trillion is more than 100 times greater than 30 years ago (Stulz (2004)). Accompanying this impressive growth in size has been an equally impressive growth in variety: The derivatives mar- ket now covers a broad spectrum of risk, including equity risk, interest rate risk, weather risk, and, most recently, credit risk and inflation risk. This phenome- nal growth in size and breadth underscores the role of derivatives in financial markets and their economic value. While financial theory has traditionally em- phasized the spanning properties of derivatives and their consequent ability to improve risk-sharing (Arrow (1964) and Ross (1976)), the role of derivatives as a vehicle for the trading of informed investors has emerged as another important",

    "abstract": "We deﬁne a sentiment indicator based on option prices, valuation ratios, and interest rates. The indicator can be interpreted as a lower bound on the expected growth in fundamentals that a rational investor would have to perceive to be happy to hold the market. The bound was unusually high in the late 1990s, reﬂecting dividend growth expectations that in our view were unreasonably optimistic. Our approach exploits two key ingredients. First, we derive a new valuation ratio decomposition that is related to the Campbell–Shiller loglinearization but that resembles the Gordon growth model more closely and has certain other advantages. Second, we introduce a volatility index that provides a lower bound on the market’s expected log return. IN This Paper , WE Introduce A Market sentiment indicator that exploits two contrasting views of market predictability. One of our aims is to ﬁnd a useful way of measuring the “bubbliness” of the market. If valuation ratios— think P/D—are high, then one starts to worry. But valuation ratios can be high for good reasons if interest rates are low, or if risk premia are low (and are widely understood to be low), or both. A vast literature studies the extent to which signals based on valuation ra- tios are able to forecast market returns and/or measures of dividend growth. Early papers include Keim and Stambaugh (1986), Campbell and Shiller (1988), and Fama and French (1988). More recently, Martin (2017) argues that implied volatility indexes based o",

    "abstract": "How important are volatility ﬂuctuations for asset prices and the macroeconomy? We ﬁnd that an increase in macroeconomic volatility is associated with an increase in discount rates and a decline in consumption. We develop a framework in which cash ﬂow, discount rate, and volatility risks determine risk premia and show that volatil- ity plays a signiﬁcant role in explaining the joint dynamics of returns to human capital and equity. Volatility risk carries a sizable positive risk premium and helps account for the cross section of expected returns. Our evidence demonstrates that volatility is important for understanding expected returns and macroeconomic ﬂuctuations. Recent Economic Analysis emphasizes the important role of macroeconomic volatility movements in determining asset prices and macroquantities. In the asset pricing model of Bansal and Yaron (2004), an increase in aggregate volatil- ity lowers asset prices and, importantly, shocks to volatility carry a separate risk premium. A growing literature in macroeconomics also highlights the ef- fect of volatility on macroquantities.1 In this paper, we show that variation in macroeconomic volatility is indeed an important and separate risk that signiﬁ- cantly affects the macroeconomy (aggregate consumption) and asset prices. To guide our analysis, we develop a dynamic asset pricing framework in which the stochastic discount factor and therefore the risk premium are determined of Pennsylvania and Nber.

    "abstract": "Managed portfolios that take less risk when volatility is high produce large alphas, increase Sharpe ratios, and produce large utility gains for mean-variance investors. We document this for the market, value, momentum, proﬁtability, return on equity, investment, and betting-against-beta factors, as well as the currency carry trade. Volatility timing increases Sharpe ratios because changes in volatility are not offset by proportional changes in expected returns. Our strategy is contrary to conventional wisdom because it takes relatively less risk in recessions. This rules out typical risk- based explanations and is a challenge to structural models of time-varying expected returns. WE Construct Portfolios That SCALEmonthly returns by the inverse of their previous month’s realized variance, decreasing risk exposure when variance was recently high and vice versa. We call these volatility-managed portfolios. We document that this simple trading strategy earns large alphas across a wide range of asset pricing factors, suggesting that investors can beneﬁt from volatility timing. We then interpret these results from both a portfolio choice and a general equilibrium perspective.

    "abstract": "The standard analysis of corporate governance assumes that shareholders vote in ratios that firms choose, such as one share-one vote. However, if the cost of unbundling and trading votes is sufficiently low, then shareholders choose the ratios. We document an active market for votes within the U.S. Equity loan market, where the average vote sells for zero. We hypothesize that asymmetric information motivates the vote trade and find support in the cross section. More trading occurs for higher-spread and worse- performing firms, especially when voting is close. Vote trading corresponds to support for shareholder proposals and opposition to management proposals.

We show that ﬁnance jobs feature high compensation, up-or-out promo- tion, and long work hours, and are more attractive than other jobs. Moral hazard problems are exacerbated in booms, even though pay increases. Employees whose talent would be more valuable elsewhere can be lured into ﬁnance jobs, while the most talented employees might be unable to land these jobs because they are “too hard to manage.” IN THE AFTERMATHof the 2007 ﬁnancial crisis, there has been much debate about the level and structure of pay in the ﬁnancial sector. Why are ﬁnancial sector employees paid so much, and why do they seem to be especially irresponsible in booms, even though their pay is higher than usual? In this paper, we build a parsimonious model that addresses these questions and also explains other distinguishing characteristics of ﬁnancial sector careers—the extreme work hours, high reliance on bonuses, and up-or-out career structures. We further explain entry and exit patterns for ﬁnancial sector employees. There is no question that ﬁnancial sector pay is extremely high.

    "abstract": "We develop and test a theory explaining the equilibrium matching of issuers and un- derwriters. We assume that issuers and underwriters associate by mutual choice, and that underwriter ability and issuer quality are complementary. Our model implies that matching is positive assortative, and that matches are based on firms’ and un- derwriters’ relative characteristics at the time of issuance. The model predicts that the market share of top underwriters and their average issue quality varies inversely with issuance volume. Various cross-sectional patterns in underwriting spreads are consistent with equilibrium matching. We find strong empirical confirmation of our theory. Once A Firm Decides to issue equity in the public market, it must next decide which underwriter to employ for the offering. And underwriters, faced with a variety of opportunities to provide their services, must decide which issuers to serve. In this paper, we develop a theory that explains the equilibrium asso- ciation of issuing firms and underwriters and produces a rich set of testable empirical implications. Examining the empirical evidence, we find strong sup- port for our theory. Our theoretical setup is based on the idea that issuing firms and underwrit- ers associate by mutual choice. This approach is new to the literature.

    "abstract": "The Homeland Investment Act provided a tax holiday for the repatriation of foreign earnings. Advocates argued the Act would alleviate ﬁnancial constraints by reducing the cost to U.S. Multinationals of accessing internal capital. This paper shows that repatriations did not increase domestic investment, employment, or R&D—even for ﬁrms that appeared to be ﬁnancially constrained or lobbied for the holiday. Instead, a $1 increase in repatriations was associated with a $0.60 to $0.92 increase in share- holder payouts. Regulations intended to restrict such payouts were undermined by the fungibility of money. Results indicate that U.S. Multinationals were not ﬁnancially constrained and were well-governed. THE Homeland Investment Act(hia), passed in 2004 as part of the American Jobs Creation Act (ajca), provided for a one-time tax holiday on the repa- triation of foreign earnings by U.S.-based multinational enterprises (MNEs).

    "title": "Wealth Destruction on a Massive Scale?",
    "abstract": "Acquiring-firm shareholders lost 12 cents around acquisition announcements per dollar spent on acquisitions for a total loss of $240 billion from 1998 through 2001, whereas they lost $7 billion in all of the 1980s, or 1.6 cents per dollar spent. The 1998 to 2001 aggregate dollar loss of acquiring-firm shareholders is so large because of a small number of acquisitions with negative synergy gains by firms with extremely high valuations. Without these acquisitions, the wealth of acquiring-firm sharehold- ers would have increased. Firms that make these acquisitions with large dollar losses perform poorly afterward. IN This Paper , WE Examine THE Experience of acquiring-firm shareholders in the recent merger wave and compare it to their experience in the merger wave of the 1980s. Such an investigation is important because the recent merger wave is the largest by far in American history. It is associated with higher stock valuations, greater use of equity as a form of payment for transactions, and more takeover defenses in place than the merger wave of the 1980s. 1 Though these differences suggest poorer returns for acquiring-firm shareholders, there are also several reasons why the acquiring-firm shareholders may have better returns. With the growth of options as a form of managerial compensation in the 1990s, managerial wealth is more closely tied to stock prices, presumably making management more conscious of the impact of acquisitions on the stock especially grateful to Harry D",

    "title": "Wealth and Executive Compensation",
    "abstract": "Using new data on the wealth of Swedish CEOs, I show that higher wealth CEOs re- ceive stronger incentives. Since high wealth (excluding own-firm holdings) implies low absolute risk aversion, this is consistent with a risk aversion explanation. To examine whether wealth is likely to proxy for power, I use lagged wealth (typically measured before the CEO was hired), and the results remain for one of two incentive measures. Also, the wealth–incentive result is not stronger for CEOs likely to face limited owner oversight. Finally, wealth is unrelated to pay levels, and is hence unlikely to proxy for skill. THE Compensation OF Chief Executives of large listed companies is often largely in the form of risky instruments such as shares and options. Since share prices are affected by many factors outside management control, this exposes CEOs to risk. According to standard agency theory, the risk inherent in incentive com- pensation should reduce optimal incentives. Looking across firms, the evidence that volatile stock prices reduce incentives in actual compensation has been mixed (see, e.g., Aggarwal and Samwick (1999), Core and Guay (2001), and Prendergast (2002) for different views). The importance of risk for incentives is thus in dispute. This paper takes another look at CEO incentives, exploiting variation in risk aversion rather than risk. Decreasing absolute risk aversion implies that a wealthy CEO is less risk-averse than a similar (same coefficient of relative risk aversion",

This positive wealth-insurance correlation, which is surprising given the prevailing view that wealth substitutes for insurance, persists after allowing for wealth-related differences in risk or bequest preferences, pricing, background risk, education, employment, or liquidity constraints. Our ﬁndings call for further inves- tigation of this wealth-coverage correlation but support theories emphasizing the consumption-smoothing role of insurance across not only states of the world, but also time. Canonical Models OF Insurance Demand such as Mossin (1968)a n d Lewis (1989), as well as the more recent models in Gollier (2003) and Koijen, Van Nieuwerburgh, and Yogo (2016), focus on the role of insurance in smooth- ing consumption across states of the world.

Firms respond to these shocks by drawing on and increasing the size of their credit lines. Banks charge borrowers for this liquidity via increased interest rates and less borrower-friendly loan provisions. Credit line adjustments occur within one calendar quarter of the shock and persist for at least nine months. Overall, we provide evi- dence that bank credit lines are an important tool for managing the nonfundamental component of cash ﬂow volatility, especially for solvent, small bank borrowers. HOW Useful TO Firms ARE bank lines of credit? On the one hand, Shockley and Thakor (1997) and Holmstrom and Tirole (1998) argue that credit lines precommit banks to provide debt ﬁnancing when ﬁrms face negative shocks. On the other hand, Suﬁ (2009) ﬁnds that access to credit lines is restricted following a decline in borrower proﬁtability, presumably when ﬁrms most need the ﬁnancing. Acharya et al.

    "title": "What Determines the Domestic Bias and Foreign",
    "abstract": "We examine how mutual funds from 26 developed and developing countries allocate their investment between domestic and foreign equity markets and what factors de- termine their asset allocations worldwide. We find robust evidence that these funds, in aggregate, allocate a disproportionately larger fraction of investment to domestic stocks. Results indicate that the stock market development and familiarity variables have significant, but asymmetric, effects on the domestic bias (domestic investors overweighting the local markets) and foreign bias (foreign investors under or over- weighting the overseas markets), and that economic development, capital controls, and withholding tax variables have significant effects only on the foreign bias. Increased Access TO Financial Markets Across the globe has provided expand- ing opportunities for investors to diversify their investments across many markets. It is widely recognized that cross-border diversification of equity portfolios offers potential gains to investors (Grubel (1968), Levy and Sar- nat (1970), Solnik (1974), Grauer and Hakansson (1987), Eldor, Pines, and Schwartz (1988), DeSantis and Gerard (1997), among others). Substantial re- search has shown, however, that investors do not exploit such diversification opportunities, as they allocate a relatively large fraction of their wealth to do- mestic equities, a phenomenon commonly called the “home bias”— representing one of the unresolved puzzles in the international finance l",

    "abstract": "We ask whether mutual funds’ ﬂows reﬂect the incentives of the brokers interme- diating them. The incentives we address are those revealed in statutory ﬁlings: the brokers’ shares of sales loads and other revenue, and their afﬁliation with the fund family. We ﬁnd signiﬁcant effects of these payments to brokers on funds’ inﬂows, particularly when the brokers are not afﬁliated. Tracking these investments forward, we ﬁnd load sharing, but not revenue sharing, to predict poor performance, consis- tent with the different incentives these payments impart. We identify one beneﬁt of captive brokerage, which is the recapture of redemptions elsewhere in the family. THE Decision TO Invest in a mutual fund is usually traced to the investor’s preferences and information. However, the vast majority of long-term mutual fund assets arrived through some layer of intermediation (Investment Com- brokers to play a role.

    "abstract": "This study empirically evaluates the certification and value-added roles of reputable venture capitalists (VCs). Using a novel sample of entrepreneurial start-ups with multiple financing offers, I analyze financing offers made by competing VCs at the first professional round of start-up funding, holding characteristics of the start-up fixed. Offers made by VCs with a high reputation are three times more likely to be accepted, and high-reputation VCs acquire start-up equity at a 10–14% discount. The evidence suggests that VCs’ “extra-financial” value may be more distinctive than their functionally equivalent financial capital. These extra-financial services can have financial consequences. A Central Issue for early-stage high-tech entrepreneurs is obtaining external resources when the assets of their start-up are intangible and knowledge-based. Particularly for entrepreneurs without an established reputation, convincing external resource providers such as venture capitalists (VCs) to provide finan- cial capital may be challenging. The literature contains two main lines of re- on designing institutional structures to permit financing early-stage ventures. This contractual- and monitoring-based approach is aimed at solving poten- tial agency problems between investors and entrepreneurs (e.g., Admati and Pfleiderer (1994), Lerner (1995), Hellmann (1998), and Kaplan and Str¨omberg quality of a start-up cannot be directly observed, external actors rely on the quality of the start-u",

    "title": "What Do Returns to Acquiring Firms Tell Us?",
    "abstract": "We study shareholder returns for firms that acquired five or more public, private, and/or subsidiary targets within a short time period. Since the same bidder chooses different types of targets and methods of payment, any variation in returns must be due to the characteristics of the target and the bid. Results indicate bidder shareholders gain when buying a private firm or subsidiary but lose when pur- chasing a public firm. Further, the return is greater the larger the target and if the bidder offers stock. These results are consistent with a liquidity discount, and tax and control effects in this market. Takeovers are one of the most important events in corporate finance, both in target firms gain significantly and that wealth is created at the announce- ment of takeovers (i.e., combined bidder and target returns are positive). However, we know much less about the effects of takeovers on the share- holders of acquiring firms. Evidence suggests that these shareholders earn, on average, a zero abnormal return at the acquisition's announcement, though there is tremendous variation in these returns. Researchers have been un- able to successfully explain much of this variation, partially because the announcement of a takeover reveals information about numerous things. For example, Grinblatt and Titman (2002, p. 708) state that the stock return at the time of the bid cannot be completely attributed to the expected effect of the acquisition on profitability, arguing that, \"the st",

    "abstract": "The literature on managerial style posits a linear relation between a chief executive ofﬁcer’s (CEOs) past experiences and ﬁrm risk. We show that there is a nonmono- tonic relation between the intensity of CEOs’ early-life exposure to fatal disasters and corporate risk-taking. CEOs who experience fatal disasters without extremely negative consequences lead ﬁrms that behave more aggressively, whereas CEOs who witness the extreme downside of disasters behave more conservatively. These patterns manifest across various corporate policies including leverage, cash hold- ings, and acquisition activity.

    "abstract": "We decompose the returns of ﬁve well-known anomalies into cash ﬂow and discount rate news. Common patterns emerge across the ﬁve factor portfolios and their mean- variance efﬁcient (MVE) combination. Whereas discount rate news predominates in market returns, systematic cash ﬂow news drives the returns of anomaly portfolios and their MVE combination with the market portfolio. Anomaly cash ﬂow and dis- count rate shocks are largely uncorrelated with market cash ﬂow and discount rate shocks and with business cycle ﬂuctuations. These rich empirical patterns restrict the joint dynamics of ﬁrm cash ﬂows and the pricing kernel, thereby informing models of stocks’ expected returns. Over THE Past 30 Years, researchers have uncovered robust patterns in stock returns that contradict classic asset pricing theories. A prominent example is that value stocks outperform growth stocks, even though they are similarly exposed to ﬂuctuations in the overall stock market. To exploit such anomalies, investors can form long-short portfolios (e.g., long value and short growth) with high average returns and near-zero market risk. These long-short anomaly portfolios are an important part of the mean-variance efﬁcient (MVE) portfolio and thus the stochastic discount factor (SDF). In the ﬁve-factor Fama and French (2015) model, nonmarket factors account for 85% of the variance in the model’s implied SDF.1 Researchers sharply disagree about the source of these nonmarket factors.

    "title": "What Drives Firm-Level Stock Returns?",
    "abstract": "I use a vector autoregressive model (VAR) to decompose an individual firm's stock return into two components: changes in cash-flow expectations (i.e., cash-flow news) and changes in discount rates (i.e., expected-return news). The VAR yields three main results. First, firm-level stock returns are mainly driven by cash-flow news. For a typical stock, the variance of cash-flow news is more than twice that of expected-return news. Second, shocks to expected returns and cash flows are pos- itively correlated for a typical small stock. Third, expected-return-news series are highly correlated across firms, while cash-flow news can largely be diversified away in aggregate portfolios. BY Definition, A Firm's Stock Returns are driven by shocks to expected cash flows (i.e., cash-flow news) and/or shocks to discount rates (i.e., expected- importance of cash-flow and expected-return news for aggregate portfolio returns (e.g., Campbell (1991) and Campbell and Ammer (1993)), but virtu- ally no evidence on the relative importance of these components at the firm level.

    "abstract": "A higher U.S. Government debt-to-output (D-O) ratio does not forecast higher sur- pluses or lower returns on Treasurys in the future. Neither future cash ﬂows nor discount rates account for the variation in the current D-O ratio. The market val- uation of Treasurys is surprisingly insensitive to macro fundamentals. Instead, the future D-O ratio accounts for most of the variation because the D-O ratio is highly persistent. Systematic surplus forecast errors may help account for these ﬁndings. Since the start of the Global Financial Crisis, surplus projections have anticipated a large ﬁscal correction that failed to materialize. IN Light OF Large Increases in the government debt-to-output (D-O) ratios over the past 15 years, there is an ongoing debate in the United States and other advanced economies about ﬁscal sustainability (see, e.g., Croce, Nguyen, and Schmid (2012), Brunnermeier, Merkel, and Sannikov (2020), Chernov , Schmid, and Schneider (2020), Mian, Straub, and Suﬁ (2021), Reis (2021), Jiang et al.

    "abstract": "I decompose the variation of credit spreads for corporate bonds into changing expected returns and changing expectation of credit losses. Using a log-linearized pricing iden- tity and a vector autoregression applied to microlevel data from 1973 to 2011, I ﬁnd that expected returns contribute to the cross-sectional variance of credit spreads nearly as much as expected credit loss does. However, most of the time-series variation in credit spreads for the market portfolio corresponds to risk premiums. What Drives THE Cross-sectional variation in credit spreads? Credit spreads are higher when the corporate bond issuer faces a higher default risk and when the discount rate for the corporate bond’s cash ﬂows rises. Since ex- relies on structural models of debt, such as the Merton (1974) model, to de- compose credit spreads. However, there is little agreement on the best mea- sures of expected default loss and expected returns. In this article, I take advantage of a large panel data set of U.S. Corporate bond prices and esti- mate the conditional expectations without relying on a particular model of default. Based on these estimates, I quantify the contributions of the de- fault component and the discount rate component to the variation in credit spreads. I apply the variance decomposition approach of Campbell and Shiller (1988a, 1988b) to the credit spread. In the decomposition, the credit spread plays the role of the dividend-price ratio for stocks, while credit loss plays the rol",

    "title": "What Drives the Disposition Effect? An Analysis",
    "abstract": "We investigate whether prospect theory preferences can predict a disposition effect. We consider two implementations of prospect theory: in one case, preferences are defined over annual gains and losses; in the other, they are defined over realized gains and losses. Surprisingly, the annual gain/loss model often fails to predict a disposition effect. The realized gain/loss model, however, predicts a disposition effect more reliably. Utility from realized gains and losses may therefore be a useful way of thinking about certain aspects of individual investor trading. ONE OF THE Most Robust Facts About THE Trading of individual investors is the “disposition effect”: when an individual investor sells a stock in his portfolio, he has a greater propensity to sell a stock that has gone up in value since pur- chase than one that has gone down. The effect has been documented in all the available large databases of individual investor trading activity and has been linked to important pricing phenomena such as post-earnings announcement drift and stock-level momentum. Disposition effects have also been uncovered in other settings—in the real estate market, for example, and in the exercise of executive stock options. While the disposition effect is a fundamental feature of trading, its underlying cause remains unclear.Why do individual investors have a greater propensity to John Campbell, Francisco Gomes, Mark Grinblatt, Bing Han, Xuedong He, Daniel Kahneman, George Loewenstein, Cade Mas",

    "abstract": "This paper analyzes the impact of changes in monetary policy on equity prices, with the objectives of both measuring the average reaction of the stock market and under- standing the economic sources of that reaction. We find that, on average, a hypothetical unanticipated 25-basis-point cut in the Federal funds rate target is associated with about a 1% increase in broad stock indexes. Adapting a methodology due to Camp- bell and Ammer, we find that the effects of unanticipated monetary policy actions on expected excess returns account for the largest part of the response of stock prices. THE Ultimate Objectives OF Monetary Policy are expressed in terms of macroe- conomic variables such as output, employment, and inflation. However, the influence of monetary policy instruments on these variables is at best indi- rect. The most direct and immediate effects of monetary policy actions, such as changes in the Federal funds rate, are on the financial markets; by affect- ing asset prices and returns, policymakers try to modify economic behavior in ways that will help to achieve their ultimate objectives. Understanding the links between monetary policy and asset prices is thus crucially important for understanding the policy transmission mechanism. This paper is an empirical study of the relationship between monetary pol- icy and one of the most important financial markets, the market for equities.

    "abstract": "We provide evidence on the value of patents to startups by leveraging the quasi- random assignment of applications to examiners with different propensities to grant patents. Using unique data on all ﬁrst-time applications ﬁled at the U.S. Patent Ofﬁce since 2001, we ﬁnd that startups that win the patent “lottery” by drawing lenient examiners have, on average, 55% higher employment growth and 80% higher sales growth ﬁve years later. Patent winners also pursue more, and higher quality, follow-on innovation. Winning a ﬁrst patent boosts a startup’s subsequent growth and innovation by facilitating access to funding from venture capitalists, banks, and public investors. Patents Award Temporary Monopoly Rights over inventions to their inven- tors. In theory, patents can beneﬁt their holders by deterring copycats and by serving as defensive shields in litigation suits, as bargaining chips in licens- ing negotiations, and as signaling devices to attract investors and customers (Budish, Roin, and Williams (2016)). Policymakers and scholars argue that these beneﬁts offset the social cost of patent rights (Nordhaus (1969), Scherer (1972)).

    "abstract": "Privatization of state-owned enterprises is on the agenda across the globe. Using Swedish data covering two decades, we show that productivity gains and headcount reductions are associated with economic costs for incumbent workers. Workers ex- perience income losses and higher unemployment, but half of the losses are covered by the social safety net. We also ﬁnd small positive effects on entrepreneurship and cash holdings but no meaningful effects on other labor market, family, health, or household ﬁnance outcomes. Productivity improves when the CEO is replaced, and the gains outweigh workers’ income declines by a factor of between two and six. Privatization OF State -owned Enterprises (soes) ﬁgures prominently on the policy agendas of numerous advanced economies worldwide. 1 Formu- lating effective, evidence-based privatization policies requires a thorough understanding of the associated costs and beneﬁts for all stakeholders.

    "abstract": "We derive a formula for the expected return on a stock in terms of the risk-neutral variance of the market and the stock’s excess risk-neutral variance relative to that of the average stock. These quantities can be computed from index and stock option prices; the formula has no free parameters. The theory performs well empirically both in and out of sample. Our results suggest that there is considerably more vari- ation in expected returns, over time and across stocks, than has previously been acknowledged. IN This Paper , WE Derive A NEW formula that expresses the expected return on a stock in terms of the risk-neutral variance of the market, the risk-neutral variance of the individual stock, and the value-weighted average of stocks’ risk- neutral variance. Then we show that the formula performs well empirically. The inputs to the formula—the three measures of risk-neutral variance— are computed directly from option prices. As a result, our approach has some distinctive features that separate it from more conventional approaches to the cross section. First, as it is based on current market prices rather than, say, accounting information, it can in principle be implemented in real time. Nor does it require that we use any historical information. It thus represents a parsimonious al- ternative to pooling data on many ﬁrm characteristics (as, for instance, in Lewellen (2015)).

    "abstract": "A unique data set allows us to monitor the buys, sells, and holds of individuals and institutions in the Finnish stock market on a daily basis. With this data set, we employ Logit regressions to identify the determinants of buying and selling activ- ity over a two-year period. We find evidence that investors are reluctant to realize losses, that they engage in tax-loss selling activity, and that past returns and his- torical price patterns, such as being at a monthly high or low, affect trading. There also is modest evidence that life-cycle trading plays a role in the pattern of buys and sells. THE Extraordinary Degree OF Trading Activity in financial markets repre- sents one of the great challenges to the field of finance. Many theoretical models in finance, such as those found in Aumann (1976) and Milgrom and by Odean (1999) also shows that the trades of many investors not only fail to cover transaction costs, but tend to lose money before transaction costs. To address the puzzle of why so much trading occurs, it would be useful to understand what motivates trades and whether such motivations are rooted in behavioral hypotheses, such as an aversion to realizing losses, a mis- guided belief in contrarianism or momentum that might be evidence of over- confidence (see, e.g., Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam (1998)), or a love of gambling. Alternatively, it would be equally useful to learn if more rational motivations, such as portfolio rebalancing consistent with mean- va",

    "abstract": "Performance: ﬂuid intelligence, cognitive reﬂection, and theory of mind (ToM). Fluid intelligence provides traders with computational skills necessary to draw a statisti- cal inference. Cognitive reﬂection helps traders avoid behavioral biases and thereby extract signals from market orders and update their prior beliefs accordingly. ToM describes the degree to which traders correctly assess the informational content of or- ders. We show that cognitive reﬂection and ToM are complementary because traders beneﬁt from understanding signals’ quality only if they are capable of processing these signals. THE Cornerstone Models OF FINANCEbuild on the assumption that a represen- tative economic agent acts rationally (e.g., Markowitz (1952), Sharpe (1964), Samuelson (1970)). However, the rationality assumption, which requires that individuals correctly apply and carry out mathematical and statistical meth- ods, has been challenged by behavioral ﬁnance studies that ﬁnd a large degree of variability in individuals’ ability to solve complex problems. When presented with such problems, most individuals tend to rely on simple heuristics instead of performing the requisite calculations (e.g., see Thaler (1993, 2005), Barberis and Thaler (2003), Shefrin (2007) for surveys). The heterogeneity in individuals’ cognitive capacities suggests that we may observe signiﬁcant differences in their ﬁnancial decisions.

    "abstract": "We survey a representative sample of U.S. Individuals about how well leading aca- demic theories describe their ﬁnancial beliefs and decisions. We ﬁnd substantial sup- port for many factors hypothesized to affect portfolio equity share, particularly back- ground risk, investment horizon, rare disasters, transactional factors, and ﬁxed costs of stock market participation. Individuals tend to believe that past mutual fund per- formance is a good signal of stock-picking skill, actively managed funds do not suffer from diseconomies of scale, value stocks are safer and do not have higher expected returns, and high-momentum stocks are riskier and do have higher expected returns. THE Finance Literature Offers NO shortage of theories about investor moti- vations and beliefs, which translate into choices that in aggregate determine asset prices. However, testing these theories with observational data has been difﬁcult. Finding empirical variation in a hypothesized factor that is incontro- vertibly uncorrelated with potentially relevant unobserved variables is often impossible. If we instead evaluate models based primarily on their ability to match endogenous moments in the data, we run up against the difﬁculty that Hector Calvo Pardo; John Campbell; Raj Chetty; Joao Cocco; Lorenzo Garlappi; Richard Evans; Vincent Glode; William Goetzmann; Luigi Guiso; Jonathan Ingersoll; Ravi Jagannathan; Marcin Kacperczyk; Panu Kalmi; Raymond Kan; Alina Lerman; Tobias Moskowitz; Stefan Nagel; Monika",

    "title": "What Type of Process Underlies Options?",
    "abstract": "We develop a simple robust method to distinguish the presence of continuous and discontinuous components in the price of an asset underlying options. Our method examines the prices of at-the-money and out-of-the-money options as the option's time-to-maturity approaches zero. We show that these prices converge to zero at speeds that depend upon whether the underlying asset price process is purely continuous, purely discontinuous, or a combination of both. We apply the method to S&P 500 index options and find the existence of both a continuous component and a jump component in the index. To effectively price or hedge derivative securities, or to understand the behavior of financial asset prices in general, it is important to know if they are best mod- eled using a purely continuous process (PC), a pure jump process (PJ), or a combi- nation of both (CJ). We develop a method to distinguish between these possibilities using options written on the asset in question. Specifically, we exam- ine the market prices of at-the-money (ATM) and out-of-the-money (OTM) op- tions as the option's maturity date approaches the valuation date. While the prices of all ATM and OTM options converge to zero as the time to maturity ap- proaches zero, our theoretical work shows that the speed of convergence differs across the three possibilities (PC, PJ, or CJ). We can thus identify the type of an asset price process by examining the convergence speeds of these option prices. The simplest approach for d",

    "abstract": "We examine the effect of securities laws on stock market development in 49 countries. We find little evidence that public enforcement benefits stock markets, but strong evidence that laws mandating disclosure and facilitating private enforcement through liability rules benefit stock markets. IN This Paper , WE Examine Securities Laws OF 49 Countries, focusing specifically on how these laws regulate the issuance of new equity to the public. Security issuance is subject to the well-known “promoter’s problem” (Mahoney (1995))— the risk that corporate issuers sell bad securities to the public—and as such is covered in all securities laws. 1 We analyze the specific provisions in securities laws governing initial public offerings in each country, examine the relationship between these provisions and various measures of stock market development, and interpret the evidence in light of the available theories of securities laws. For securities markets, alternative theories of optimal legal arrangements can be distilled down to three broad hypotheses. Under the null hypothesis, associated with Coase (1960) and Stigler (1964), the optimal government pol- icy is to leave securities markets unregulated. Issuers of securities have an incentive to disclose all available information to obtain higher prices simply be- cause failure to disclose would cause investors to assume the worst (Grossman (1981), Grossman and Hart (1980), Milgrom and Roberts (1986)).

    "abstract": "We examine the price behavior and market activity of the Jardine Group com- panies after they were delisted from Hong Kong in 1994. Although the trading activity of the Jardine Group moved to Singapore, the core businesses re- mained in Hong Kong and Mainland China. Evidence indicates the Jardine stocks are correlated less (more) with the Hong Kong (Singapore) market after the delisting. This result cannot be explained by various hypotheses, such as relocation of core business, time-varying betas, migration of trading activity, and currency and tax distortions. We conclude that price fluctuations are af- fected by country-specific investor sentiment. Many Companies ARE Cross-listed in different countries to broaden their capital and investor base. If international financial markets are perfectly integrated, stock price movements should not be affected by their trading location. However, recent studies show that the share price of a company is excessively influenced by the market in which the stock is traded, indicating that the international markets are partially segmented. For example, Bodurtha, Kim, and Lee (1995) show that in the U.S. Market, the prices of closed-end country funds are strongly affected by U.S. Market movement, even though their net asset values are not.

    "abstract": "We investigate odd-lot trades in equity markets. Odd lots are increasingly used in algorithmic and high-frequency trading, but are not reported to the consolidated tape or in databases such as TAQ. In our sample, the median number of odd-lot trades is 24% but in some stocks odd lots are 60% or more of trading. Odd-lot trades contribute 35% of price discovery, consistent with informed traders using odd lots to avoid detection. Omitting odd-lot trades leads to inaccuracies in order imbalance measures and makes sentiment measures unreliable. Excluding odd lots from the consolidated tape raises important regulatory issues. ODD Lots ARE Trades for less than 100 shares of stock. Traditionally, odd-lot trades and volumes were small, and were thought to originate from retail traders and so they were viewed as having little information content with respect to future price movements—that is, as irrelevant. As a result, the convention followed by all market centers was that only round-lot trades of 100 shares and mixed-lot trades of greater than 100 shares are reported to the consolidated tape.1 providing data, and to Soeren Hvidkjaer for providing computer code.

    "title": "When Financial Institutions Are Large",
    "abstract": "While financial institutions’ aggregate investments have grown substantially world- wide, the size of their individual shareholdings, and ultimately their incentive to monitor, may be limited by the free-rider problem, regulations, and a preference for diversification and liquidity. We compare institutions’ shareholding patterns across countries and find vast differences in the extent to which they are large shareholders. These variations are largely determined by macro corporate governance factors such as shareholder protection, law enforcement, and corporate disclosure requirements. This suggests that strong governance environments act to strengthen monitoring abil- ity such that more institutions are encouraged to hold concentrated equity positions. Institutional Investments IN World Equity Markets have grown substantially in recent decades. 1 While this trend has led to financial institutions becom- ing the largest investor class in many countries, the extent to which they are willing to take concentrated ownership positions remains unclear. 2 From a corporate governance perspective, analyzing concentrated shareholdings is important because they provide an incentive to monitor (Shleifer and Vishny (1986)). However, acquiring such shareholdings can be prohibitively costly for financial institutions due to the free-rider problem, regulatory investment lim- its, as well as a preference for diversification and liquidity (Admati, Pfleiderer, and Zechner (1994), Bhide (1994), B",

    "title": "When Is Bad News Really Bad News?",
    "abstract": "We examine whether the price response to bad and good earnings shocks changes as the relative level of the market changes. The study is based on a complete sample of annual earnings announcements during the period 1988 to 1998. The relative level of the market is based on the difference between the current market P/E and the average market P/E over the prior 12 months. We find that the stock price response to negative earnings surprises increases as the relative level of the market rises. Furthermore, the difference between bad news and good news earn- ings response coefficients rises with the market. ONE OF THE Longest Running empirical debates in finance regards the relative pricing of\"value\" and \"glamour\" stocks. Beginning with early work by Basu (1983) and Stattman (1980), evidence has accumulated that excess returns on value stocks-that is, the issues of companies for which the ratio of earn- ings, cash flow, or book value per share is large relative to stock price-are greater than returns on glamour stocks, for which these ratios are small. On one side, Fama and French (1992, 1993, 1995, 1996) argue that the observed differential between the returns on value and glamour stocks represents a risk premium. The alternative view, articulated by Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny (1994), is that the market fails to efficiently price value and glamour stocks. Extending Lakonishok et al.

In a large sample of 10-Ks during 1994 to 2008, almost three-fourths of the words identiﬁed as negative by the widely used Harvard Dictionary are words typically not considered negative in ﬁnancial contexts. We develop an alternative negative word list, along with ﬁve other word lists, that better reﬂect tone in ﬁnancial text. We link the word lists to 10-K ﬁling returns, trading volume, return volatility, fraud, material weakness, and unexpected earnings.

    "abstract": "We provide new evidence on the role of ﬁnancial advisors in M&As. Contrary to prior studies, top-tier advisors deliver higher bidder returns than their non-top-tier counterparts but in public acquisitions only, where the advisor reputational exposure and required skills set are relatively larger. This translates into a $65.83 million shareholder gain for an average bidder. The improvement comes from top-tier advi- sors’ ability to identify more synergistic combinations and to get a larger share of synergies to accrue to bidders. Consistent with the premium price–premium quality equilibrium, top-tier advisors charge premium fees in these transactions. Mergers AND ACQUISITIONS(M&As) constitute one of the most important activ- ities in corporate ﬁnance, bringing about substantial reallocations of resources within the economy. In 2007 alone, when the most recent merger wave peaked, corporations spent $4.2 trillion on M&A deals worldwide. Investment banks ad- vised on over 85% of these deals by transaction value, generating an estimated $39.7 billion in advisory fees. The investment banking industry is dominated by a group of so-called “bulge bracket” ﬁrms.

    "abstract": "We examine how creditor protection affects ﬁrms with different levels of owners’ and managers’ personal costs of bankruptcy (PCB). Theoretically , we show that ﬁrms with high PCB borrow and invest more under a more debtor-friendly management stay system, whereas ﬁrms with low PCB borrow and invest more under a more creditor- friendly receivership system. Intuitively , stronger creditor protection relaxes ﬁnan- cial constraints but reduces credit demand. Which effect dominates depends on own- ers’ and managers’ PCB. Empirically , we ﬁnd support for these predictions using a Korean bankruptcy reform that replaced receivership with management stay . Empirical Evidence ON THE Optimal degree of creditor protection in bankruptcy is mixed. Following the seminal work of La Porta et al.

    "abstract": "We provide novel evidence for an equilibrium link between investors’ disagreement, the market price of volatility and correlation, and the differential pricing of index and individual equity options. We show that belief disagreement is positively related to (i) the wedge between index and individual volatility risk premia, (ii) the different slope of the smile of index and individual options, and (iii) the correlation risk premium. Priced disagreement risk also explains returns of option volatility and correlation trading strategies in a way that is robust to the inclusion of other risk factors and different market conditions. THE Pricing OF Index and individual stock options differs in a number of striking empirical dimensions, which represent a challenge to modern asset pricing models. First, as noted in Bakshi, Kapadia, and Madan ( 2003), the index option implied volatility smile is on average steeper and more negatively skewed than the smile of single-stock options. Second, the average volatility risk premium of index options is typically larger than that of individual stock options. For instance, while the average at-the-money implied volatility of S&P 100 index options has been about 19.2% on a yearly basis, realized volatility has been only about 16.7%, which implies an index volatility risk premium of 2.5%. In contrast, the average volatility risk premium of single-name S&P 100 stocks has been only 0.9% in the same sample period. Third, such signiﬁcant cross-sectional",

    "abstract": "This paper examines aftermarket trading of underwriters and unaffiliated market makers in the three-month period after an IPO. We find that the lead underwriter is always the dominant market maker; he takes substantial inventory positions in the aftermarket trading, and co-managers play a negligible role in aftermarket trading. The lead underwriter engages in stabilization activity for less successful IPOs, and uses the overallotment option to reduce his inventory risk. Compensa- tion to the underwriter arises primarily from fees, but aftermarket trading does generate positive profits, which are positively related to the degree of underpricing. Initial Public Offerings OF Securities are among the most important events in capital markets. By providing access to public markets, the IPO is both the conduit for new capital to flow to fledgling companies and the mecha- nism for the existing owners to realize a return for their efforts.1 The lead underwriter plays an important role in pricing and distributing an IPO, certifying the quality of the issue by his past performance in IPO under- writing.2 However, the importance of the underwriter continues beyond the IPO date, when he becomes a market maker for the newly traded stock.

    "abstract": "This paper empirically examines patents for financial formulas and methods, whose patentability was recently confirmed in the litigation between State Street Bank and Trust and Signature Financial Group. The number of such filings and awards has been accelerating. Patent filings by academics have been very infrequent, which appears to be a consequence of a lack of awareness or interest on the part of faculty Patents FOR Financial Formulas and methods, which have been awarded by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (uspto) since at least the early 1970s, have become increasingly frequent in recent years. Interest in these awards has surged since a 1998 decision in a lawsuit between Signature Financial Group and State Street Bank, which established the patentability of finan- cial and other business methods.' This paper takes a comprehensive look at financial patenting, in an effort to understand this growing area of activity and its implications for academia. The analysis proceeds in four parts. The first part documents two basic facts about finance patenting. First, numerous financial patents have been tions and grants has been accelerating. Second, the involvement of academ- ics and universities in patenting finance has been modest: universities and faculty member is far less than in other scientific disciplines.

    "abstract": "We study the value premium using the multiples-based market-to-book decomposition of Rhodes-Kropf, Robinson, and Viswanathan (2005). The market-to-value component drives all of the value strategy return, while the value-to-book component exhibits no return predictability in either portfolio sorts or ﬁrm-level regressions. Existing re- sults linking market-to-book to operating leverage, duration, exposure to investment- speciﬁc technology shocks, and analysts’ risk ratings derive from the unpriced value- to-book component. In contrast, results on expectation errors, limits to arbitrage, and certain types of cash ﬂow risk and consumption risk exposure are due to the market- to-value component. Overall, our evidence casts doubt on several value premium theories. THE Positive Return Differential between high book-to-market (value) and low book-to-market (growth) stocks is one of the most pervasive phenomena in the behavior of stock prices, having been documented in many markets around the world (e.g., Fama and French (1998, 2012), Asness, Moskowitz, is concerned with the economic origins of the book-to-market effect.

CEO candidates vary along two primary dimensions: one that captures general ability and another that contrasts communication and interpersonal skills with execution skills. We ﬁnd that subsequent performance is positively related to general ability and execution skills. The ﬁndings expand our view of CEO characteristics and types relative to previous studies. Theorists Have Long ASSUMEDthat CEOs have heterogeneous talents and abil- ities that map into ﬁrm performance. For example,Rosen (1981), Murphy and Zabojnik (2004),a n dGabaix and Landier (2008)all model CEOs with different qualities.

    "abstract": "Using a data set that provides unprecedented detail on investors’ stockholdings, we analyze whether investors take the quality of corporate governance into account when selecting stocks. We find that all categories of investors (domestic and foreign, institu- tional and small individual) who generally enjoy only security benefits are reluctant to invest in companies with weak corporate governance. In contrast, individuals con- nected with company insiders are more likely to invest in weak corporate governance companies. These findings suggest that it is important to distinguish between in- vestors who enjoy private benefits or access private information, and investors who enjoy only security benefits.

    "abstract": "Gruber (1996) and Zheng (1999) report that investors channel money toward mutual funds that subsequently perform well. Sapp and Tiwari (2004) find that this “smart money” effect no longer holds after controlling for stock return momentum. While prior work uses quarterly U.S. Data, we employ a British data set of monthly fund inflows and outflows differentiated between individual and institutional investors. We document a robust smart money effect in the United Kingdom. The effect is caused by buying (but not selling) decisions of both individuals and institutions. Using monthly data available post-1991 we show that money is comparably smart in the United States. CAN Investors Identify Superior Mutual Funds ? The first studies to address this question (Gruber (1996), Zheng (1999)) find that, indeed, funds that receive greater net money flows subsequently outperform their less popular peers. This finds that after fund performance is adjusted for the momentum factor in stock returns, greater net flows no longer lead to better performance (Sapp and Tiwari (2004)). In this paper, we reexamine the smart money issue with U.K. Data. Owing to data constraints, all of the above studies work with aggregate money flows to funds: All investors are aggregated, and sales are offset by repurchases. Furthermore, not having access to exact net flows, these papers approximate due to Robert Stambaugh (former editor) and an anonymous referee for very helpful comments and suggestions. We are also",

    "title": "Which Shorts Are Informed?",
    "abstract": "We construct a long daily panel of short sales using proprietary Nyse order data. From 2000 to 2004, shorting accounts for more than 12.9% of Nyse volume, sug- gesting that shorting constraints are not widespread. As a group, these short sellers are well informed. Heavily shorted stocks underperform lightly shorted stocks by a risk-adjusted average of 1.16% over the following 20 trading days (15.6% annualized). Institutional nonprogram short sales are the most informative; stocks heavily shorted by institutions underperform by 1.43% the next month (19.6% annualized). The re- sults indicate that, on average, short sellers are important contributors to efficient stock prices. Throughout THE Financial Economics Literature , short sellers occupy an exalted place in the pantheon of investors as rational, informed market participants who act to keep prices in line. Theoreticians often generate a divergence be- tween prices and fundamentals by building models that prohibit or constrain short sellers (e.g., Miller (1977), Harrison and Kreps (1978), Duffie, Garleanu, and Pedersen (2002), Hong, Scheinkman, and Xiong (2006)). Empirical evidence uniformly indicates that when short sale constraints are relaxed, overvalua- tions become less severe, suggesting that short sellers move prices toward fun- damentals (examples include Lamont and Thaler (2003), Danielsen and Sorescu (2001), Jones and Lamont (2002), Cohen, Diether, and Malloy (2007)).

    "abstract": "This paper investigates value and growth investing in a large administrative panel of Swedish residents. We show that, over the life cycle, households progressively shift from growth to value as they become older and their balance sheets improve. Furthermore, investors with high human capital and high exposure to macroeconomic risk tilt their portfolios away from value. While several behavioral biases seem evident in the data, the patterns we uncover are overall remarkably consistent with the portfolio implications of risk-based theories of the value premium. A Central Question OF Modern ﬁnance is why value stocks consistently out- perform growth stocks on average both in the United States and around the world (Graham and Dodd (1934), Basu (1977), Fama and French (1992, 1998)).1 As Fama and French (1992, 1995) suggest, the value premium may be compensation for systematic risks other than market portfolio return risk, Singleton (the Editor), the Associate Editor, and two anonymous referees for many insightful comments.

    "title": "Who Blinks in Volatile Markets,",
    "abstract": "We investigate the relationship between the ownership structure and returns of firms on days when the absolute value of the market's return is two percent or more. We find that a firm's abnormal return on these days is related to the per- centage of institutional ownership, that there is abnormally high turnover in the firm's shares on these days, and that this abnormal turnover is significantly re- lated to the percentage of institutional ownership in the firm. Taken together, these results are consistent with positive feedback herding behavior on the part of some institutions, particularly mutual and pension funds. WHO Sells When There IS A Large Drop in the stock market, institutional or individual investors? The answer is not clear. One could argue that individ- ual investors are less sophisticated and more risk averse than institutions, so the individual investor is the one who reacts and sells during a sharp market drop. Alternatively, one could argue that institutional investors, al- though they are more sophisticated, have short horizons. Because of this, they herd together with their peers and sell during a market decline, since \"an unprofitable decision is not as bad for reputation when others make the same mistake\" (Scharfstein and Stein (1990) and Froot, Scharfstein, and Stein (1992)). Individuals, who may make decisions based on longer-term criteria (Markowitz (1991)), would be less likely to react during short-term market swings. The answer to the question of wh",

    "title": "Who Blows the Whistle on Corporate Fraud?",
    "abstract": "To identify the most effective mechanisms for detecting corporate fraud, we study all reported fraud cases in large U.S. Companies between 1996 and 2004. We ﬁnd that fraud detection does not rely on standard corporate governance actors (investors, SEC, and auditors), but rather takes a village, including several nontraditional players (employees, media, and industry regulators). Differences in access to information, as well as monetary and reputational incentives, help to explain this pattern. In- depth analyses suggest that reputational incentives in general are weak, except for journalists in large cases. By contrast, monetary incentives help explain employee whistleblowing. THE Large AND NUMEROUScorporate frauds that emerged in the United States at the onset of the new millennium provoked an immediate legislative response in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX). This law was predicated upon the idea that the existing institutions designed to uncover fraud had failed, and that their incentives as well as their monitoring should be increased. The political imper- ative to act quickly prevented any empirical analysis to substantiate the law’s premises. Which actors bring corporate fraud to light? What motivates them? Did reforms target the right actors and change the situation? Can detection be improved in a more cost-effective way? To answer these questions, we gather data on a comprehensive sample of alleged corporate frauds that took place in U.S. Companies with more than 750 mill",

    "abstract": "We analyze lender of last resort (lolr) lending during the European sovereign debt crisis. Using a novel data set on all central bank lending and collateral, we show that weakly capitalized banks took out more Lolr loans and used riskier collateral than strongly capitalized banks. We also ﬁnd that weakly capitalized banks used Lolr loans to buy risky assets such as distressed sovereign debt. This resulted in a reallo- cation of risky assets from strongly to weakly capitalized banks. Our ﬁndings cannot be explained by classical Lolr theory. Rather, they point to risk taking by banks, both independently and with the encouragement of governments, and highlight the beneﬁt of unifying Lolr lending and bank supervision. Lender OF Last Resort(lolr) actions represent one of the most dramatic in- terventions by governments in ﬁnancial markets, particularly during ﬁnancial crises.

    "title": "Who Drove and Burst the Tech Bubble?",
    "abstract": "From 1997 to March 2000, as technology stocks rose more than ﬁve-fold, institutions bought more new technology supply than individuals. Among institutions, hedge funds were the most aggressive investors, but independent investment advisors and mutual funds (net of ﬂows) actively invested the most capital in the technology sector. The technology stock reversal in March 2000 was accompanied by a broad sell-off from institutional investors but accelerated buying by individuals, particularly discount brokerage clients. Overall, our evidence supports the bubble model of Abreu and Brunnermeier (2003), in which rational arbitrageurs fail to trade against bubbles until a coordinated selling effort occurs. Perceived Bubbles, Such AS the “tech bubble” and the more recent credit and real estate bubbles, pose challenges to efﬁcient market theories and are not well understood. The stock market run-up in the mid to late 1990s was the greatest in the last 140 years of U.S. History in terms of both price appreciation and market-wide valuation multiples. 1 While theoretical models explaining bubbles are plentiful, there is little rigorous empirical work uncovering the complex access to some of the essential data while Harris was a Nasdaq Visiting Academic Fellow.

    "title": "Who Finances Durable Goods and Why It Matters:",
    "abstract": "We propose that, by ﬁnancing their own product sales through captive ﬁnance sub- sidiaries, durable goods manufacturers commit to higher resale values for their prod- ucts in future periods. Using data on captive ﬁnancing by the manufacturers of heavy equipment, we ﬁnd that captive-backed models have lower price depreciation. The evidence is consistent with captive ﬁnance helping manufacturers commit to ex-post actions that support used machine prices. This, in turn, conveys higher pledgeabil- ity for captive-backed products, even for individual machines ﬁnanced by banks. Although motivated as a rent-seeking device, captive ﬁnancing generates positive spillovers by relaxing credit constraints. A Substantial Share OF DURABLEgoods ﬁnanced with credit in the United States is not ﬁnanced by banks, but rather by the manufacturer of the good itself. For ﬁrms making new investments in equipment used in agriculture, construction, logging, manufacturing, and printing, the share of ﬁnancing done by the wholly owned subsidiary lenders of equipment manufacturers was 58% as of 2013 and ranged from dominant (76% in agricultural equipment) to nontrivial (18% in printing) (see Figure1). And while manufacturers are important lenders within each of these industries, they are also sizable enough to be important in aggregate.

    "title": "Who Gambles in the Stock Market?",
    "abstract": "This study shows that the propensity to gamble and investment decisions are cor- related. At the aggregate level, individual investors prefer stocks with lottery fea- tures, and like lottery demand, the demand for lottery-type stocks increases during economic downturns. In the cross-section, socioeconomic factors that induce greater expenditure in lotteries are associated with greater investment in lottery-type stocks. Further, lottery investment levels are higher in regions with favorable lottery envi- ronments. Because lottery-type stocks underperform, gambling-related underperfor- mance is greater among low-income investors who excessively overweight lottery-type stocks. These results indicate that state lotteries and lottery-type stocks attract very similar socioeconomic clienteles. THE Desire TO Gamble IS Deep -rooted in the human psyche. This fascination with games of chance can be traced back at least a few centuries. A complex set of bio- logical, psychological, religious, and socioeconomic factors jointly determines an individual’s propensity to gamble (e.g., France (1902), Brenner (1983), Walker (1992)). In this study, I investigate the extent to which people’s overall attitudes toward gambling influence their stock investment decisions. Previous studies have emphasized the potential role of gambling in invest- ment decisions (e.g., Friedman and Savage (1948), Markowitz (1952), Shiller (1989, 2000), Shefrin and Statman (2000), Statman (2002), Barberis and Huang to t",

    "title": "Who Owns What? A Factor Model for Direct",
    "abstract": "We build a cross-sectional factor model for investors’ direct stockholdings and estimate it using data from almost 10 million retail accounts in the Indian stock market. Our model identiﬁes strong investor clienteles for stock characteristics, most notably ﬁrm age and share price, and for particular clusters of stock characteristics. These clienteles are intuitively associated with investor attributes such as account age, size, and diversiﬁcation. Coheld stocks tend to have higher return covariance, inconsistent with simple models of diversiﬁcation but suggestive that clientele de- mands inﬂuence stock returns. Finance Theorists Have Developed A Rich variety of models to describe household portfolio choice. Most famously, the venerable Capital Asset Pricing Model (capm) says that all investors should hold the same risky portfolio, with different degrees of cash dilution to accommodate differences in risk aversion (Markowitz (1952), Tobin ( 1958), Sharpe ( 1964), Lintner ( 1965)). What evidence we have on household portfolios differs substantially from the Capm prediction. In particular, the evidence documents considerable het- erogeneity in portfolio composition (for a survey, see Curcuru et al. ( 2010)). More complex theories to explain this heterogeneity can be broadly classiﬁed into two groups. One group focuses on heterogeneous ﬁnancial circumstances such as nontraded income risks (Mayers ( 1972), Vissing-Jørgensen ( 2002), of the Federal Reserve System. The views in this",

    "abstract": "Using microdata from U.S. Household surveys, I document that families with a ﬁnan- cially sophisticated husband are more likely to participate in the stock market than those with a wife of equal ﬁnancial sophistication. This pattern is best explained by gender identity norms, which constrain women’s inﬂuence over intrahousehold ﬁnancial decision-making. A randomized controlled experiment reveals that female identity hinders idea contribution by the wife. These ﬁndings underscore the roles of intrahousehold bargaining and traditional norms in shaping household ﬁnancial decisions. IN THE Antebellum South , Women were expected to “recognize their sub- ordinate place and to be obedient to the head of the family” (Scott (1970)). More than a century later, gender inequality persists despite women’s em- powerment. To illustrate, while married women’s labor force participation has surged from 2% to 73% over the past century (Fernández (2013)), female work- ers continue to face a gender pay gap of more than 20% (Blau and Kahn (2017)).

    "abstract": "Firms have an incentive to manage media coverage to inﬂuence their stock prices during important corporate events. Using comprehensive data on media coverage and merger negotiations, we ﬁnd that bidders in stock mergers originate substan- tially more news stories after the start of merger negotiations, but before the public announcement. This strategy generates a short-lived run-up in bidders’ stock prices during the period when the stock exchange ratio is determined, which substantially impacts the takeover price. Our results demonstrate that the timing and content of ﬁnancial media coverage may be biased by ﬁrms seeking to manipulate their stock price. THE Relation Between INFORMATIONand stock prices is central to ﬁnance, dat- ing back to at least Fama et al. (1969). Key to this relation is the ﬁnancial media, which serves as the main channel through which information is disseminated (Barber and Odean (2008), Engelberg and Parsons (2011)) and affects prices documents that news coverage impacts the valuation of ﬁrms, relatively little is known about the opposite: how ﬁrms actively manage their media coverage.

    "title": "Wholesale Funding Dry-Ups",
    "abstract": "We empirically explore the fragility of wholesale funding of banks, using transaction- level data on short-term, unsecured certiﬁcates of deposit in the European market. We do not observe a market-wide freeze during the 2008 to 2014 period. Yet, many banks suddenly experience funding dry-ups. Dry-ups predict, but do not cause, future deterioration in bank performance. Furthermore, during periods of market stress, banks with high future performance tend to increase reliance on wholesale funding. We therefore fail to ﬁnd evidence consistent with adverse selection models of fund- ing market freezes. Our evidence is in line with theories highlighting heterogeneity between informed and uninformed lenders. TO Finance Themselves , Banks Rely ON deposits and wholesale funding. The latter includes repurchase agreements, interbank loans, and debt securities sold on ﬁnancial markets, often with short-term maturities. A prevailing view among economists and regulators is that wholesale funding is vulnerable to sudden stops, or dry-ups, during which banks lose funding regardless of their credit quality. Such breakdowns have major macroeconomic consequences, as they may force banks to cut lending (Iyer et al. ( 2014)) and affect real out- comes such as unemployment (Chodorow-Reich ( 2014)). To mitigate this con- cern, new regulatory liquidity ratios penalize the use of wholesale funding (Tarullo (2014)).

    "abstract": "Many financial markets are characterized by strong relationships and networks, rather than arm’s-length, spot market transactions. We examine the performance con- sequences of this organizational structure in the context of relationships established when VCs syndicate portfolio company investments. We find that better-networked VC firms experience significantly better fund performance, as measured by the pro- portion of investments that are successfully exited through an IPO or a sale to another company. Similarly, the portfolio companies of better-networked VCs are significantly more likely to survive to subsequent financing and eventual exit. We also provide initial evidence on the evolution of VC networks. Networks ARE Widespread IN Many Financial Markets . Bulge-bracket invest- ment banks, for instance, make use of strong relationships with institutional investors when pricing and distributing corporate securities (Cornelli and Goldreich (2001)). In the corporate loan market, banks often prefer syndicating loans with other banks over being the sole lender. Similarly, in the primary equity and bond markets, banks tend to co-underwrite securities offerings with banks with which they have longstanding relationships (Ljungqvist, Marston, and Wilhelm (2005)). Networks also feature prominently in the venture capital (VC) industry. VCs tend to syndicate their investments with other VCs, rather than investing alone (Lerner (1994a)).

    "abstract": "Private equity funds are important to the economy, yet there is little analysis explain- ing their financial structure. In our model the financial structure minimizes agency conflicts between fund managers and investors. Relative to financing each deal sep- arately, raising a fund where the manager receives a fraction of aggregate excess re- turns reduces incentives to make bad investments. Efficiency is further improved by requiring funds to also use deal-by-deal debt financing, which becomes unavailable in states where internal discipline fails. Private equity investment becomes highly sensitive to aggregate credit conditions and investments in bad states outperform investments in good states. Practitioner: “Things are really tough because the banks are only lending four times cash ﬂow, when they used to lend six times cash ﬂow. We can’t make our deals proﬁtable anymore.” Academic: “Why do you care if banks will not lend you as much as they used to? If you are unable to lever up as much as before, your limited partners will receive lower expected returns on any given deal, but the risk to them will have gone down proportionately.” Practitioner: “Ah yes, the Modigliani-Miller theorem.

    "title": "Why Are CEOs Rarely Fired? Evidence from",
    "abstract": "I evaluate the forced CEO turnover rate and quantify effects on shareholder value by estimating a dynamic model. The model features learning about CEO ability and costly turnover. To ﬁt the observed forced turnover rate, the model needs the average board of directors to behave as if replacing the CEO costs shareholders at least $200 million. This cost mainly reﬂects CEO entrenchment rather than a real cost to share- holders. The model predicts that shareholder value would rise 3% if we eliminated this perceived turnover cost, all else equal. The model also helps explain the relation between CEO ﬁrings, tenure, and proﬁtability. ON Average,2 % OF CEOs at large U.S. Corporations are ﬁred each year (e.g., Huson, Parrino, and Starks (2001), Kaplan and Minton (2006)). This rate seems low, and it is tempting to conclude that CEOs are entrenched and boards of directors are not acting in shareholders’ interests. However, the literature pro- vides little guidance for making such judgments. For example, it is not clear what rate of forced CEO turnover we should expect from a well-functioning board. It is therefore difﬁcult to judge whether the observed 2% rate is low or high. If it is indeed too low, it is not clear how much shareholder value is being destroyed.

    "title": "Why Are U.S. Stocks More Volatile?",
    "abstract": "U.S. Stocks are more volatile than stocks of similar foreign ﬁrms. A ﬁrm’s stock return volatility can be higher for reasons that contribute positively (good volatility) or negatively (bad volatility) to shareholder wealth and economic growth. We ﬁnd that the volatility of U.S. ﬁrms is higher mostly because of good volatility. Speciﬁcally, stock volatility is higher in the United States because it increases with investor protection, stock market development, new patents, and ﬁrm-level investment in R&D. Each of these factors is related to better growth opportunities for ﬁrms and better ability to take advantage of these opportunities. WHY IS IT That ﬁrms from some countries have higher stock return volatilities than ﬁrms from other countries? More speciﬁcally, why is it that U.S. ﬁrms have more volatile stock returns than similar ﬁrms from other countries? Com- mentators often attribute this high volatility to a casino mentality or to short- termism. 1 The ﬁnance literature offers additional reasons for why stock return volatility depends on country characteristics. In that literature, there exists both good volatility and bad volatility. A ﬁrm’s stock return volatility can be higher in a country because institutions in that country make it advantageous for ﬁrms to take risks that lead to greater economic growth (e.g., Acemoglu and Ziliboti (1997) and Obstfeld (1994)). Alternatively, a ﬁrm’s stock return volatility can be high because of country-speciﬁc forces, such as politi",

    "title": "Why Do Firms Become Widely Held? An Analysis",
    "abstract": "We examine the evolution of insider ownership of IPO firms from 1970 to 2001 to understand how U.S. Firms become widely held. A majority of these firms has insider ownership below 20% after 10 years. Stock market performance and liquidity play an extremely important role in ownership dynamics. Firms with stocks that are highly valued, are liquid, and have performed well experience large decreases in insider ownership and become widely held. Ownership also falls for low cash flow and high capital expenditures firms. Surprisingly, variables proxying for agency costs have limited success in explaining the evolution of insider ownership. Most Firms Start Their Life with high insider ownership. Yet, the typical large established U.S. Firm has fairly dispersed ownership. How do firms evolve so that many of them end up with dispersed ownership? Why does that evolution take place? A number of recent studies examine the determinants of insider or managerial ownership. A particular point in time, insiders or managers own a larger fraction of shares in some firms than in others, the evolution of ownership as firms mature has not been the object of much study in the United States. 2 As a result, we know little about the dynamics of insider ownership following a firm’s IPO. In this paper, we attempt to understand these dynamics better.

    "title": "Why Do Firms Evade Taxes? The Role of",
    "abstract": "Tax evasion is a widespread phenomenon across the globe and even an important factor in the ongoing sovereign debt crisis. We show that ﬁrms in countries with better credit information–sharing systems and higher branch penetration evade taxes to a lesser degree. This effect is stronger for smaller ﬁrms, ﬁrms in smaller cities and towns, ﬁrms in industries relying more on external ﬁnancing, and ﬁrms in industries and countries with greater growth potential. This effect is robust to instrumental variable analysis, controlling for ﬁrm ﬁxed effects in a smaller panel data set of countries, and many other robustness tests. A Growing Literature dating back to King and Levine (1993) demonstrates the important connections between ﬁnancial development and growth, a link that has spurred further exploration into various aspects of ﬁnancial development and their inﬂuences on the economy . 1 Much of this evidence, however, relies on macro country-level data and aggregate measures of ﬁnancial development (e.g., private credit to GDP ratio) and economic performance (e.g., GDP growth). Using a large sample of ﬁrm-level survey data on more than 64,000 ﬁrms across 102 countries over the period 2002 to 2010, this paper assesses the relationship Netherlands; and Cepr, London.

    "title": "Why Do Firms Issue Equity?",
    "abstract": "We develop and test a new theory of security issuance that is consistent with the puzzling stylized fact that firms issue equity when their stock prices are high. The theory also generates new predictions. Our theory predicts that managers use equity to finance projects when they believe that investors’ views about project payoffs are likely to be aligned with theirs, thus maximizing the likelihood of agreement with investors. Otherwise, they use debt. We find strong empirical support for our theory and document its incremental explanatory power over other security-issuance theories such as market timing and time-varying adverse selection. A Central Question IN Corporate Finance IS: Why and when do firms issue equity? Recent empirical papers have exposed significant gaps between the stylized facts and theories of security issuance and capital structure, so we seem to lack a coherent answer to this question. Our purpose is to develop a new theory of security issuance that is consistent with these difficult-to-explain stylized facts. One empirical regularity is the genesis of the current debate: Firms issue equity when their stock prices are high. This fact is inconsistent with the two main theories of security issuance and capital structure: tradeoff and pecking order. The tradeoff theory asserts that a firm’s security issuance decisions move its capital structure toward an optimum that is determined by a tradeoff be- tween the marginal costs (bankruptcy and agency costs) and",

    "title": "Why Do Firms Use Incentives That Have No Incentive Effects?",
    "abstract": "This paper illustrates why firms might choose to implement stock option plans or other pay instruments that reward “luck.” I consider a model where adjusting compensation contracts is costly and where employees’ outside opportunities are correlated with their firms’ performance. The model may help to explain the use and recent rise of broad-based stock option plans, as well as other financial instruments, even when these pay plans have no effect on employees’ on-the-job behavior. The model suggests that agency theory’s often-overlooked participation constraint may be an important determinant of some common compensation schemes, particularly for employees below the highest executive ranks. Many Compensation Plans Reward or punish employees for factors they cannot control. An often-discussed example of this phenomenon is executive compen- sation (where stock options are not generally indexed to the overall market). However, many firms also offer firm-wide stock options and profit sharing plans that provide even weaker incentives than executive plans—after all, most work- ers can expect to reap trivial personal gain from their contribution to firm value or profits. I consider an explanation for this phenomenon in which firms con- tract with employees as a means of indexing wages to market rates rather than to provide incentives. While much of the agency literature has concentrated on inducing optimal effort, I consider the importance of the generally overlooked participation con",

    "abstract": "Foreign ﬁrms terminate their Securities and Exchange Commission registration in the aftermath of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act (SOX) because they no longer require out- side funds to ﬁnance growth opportunities. Deregistering ﬁrms’ insiders beneﬁt from greater discretion to consume private beneﬁts without having to raise higher cost funds. Foreign ﬁrms with more agency problems have worse stock-price reactions to the adoption of Rule 12h-6 in 2007, which made deregistration easier, than those ﬁrms more adversely affected by the compliance costs of SOX. Stock-price reactions to deregistration announcements are negative, but less so under Rule 12h-6, and more so for ﬁrms that raise fewer funds externally. A Large Literature examines why foreign ﬁrms choose to list their shares on a U.S. Stock exchange. 1 Recently, there has been an increase in the number of foreign ﬁrms leaving U.S. Markets. This has led to the concern that U.S. Stock exchanges have become less attractive to foreign ﬁrms, perhaps because of the passage of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act (SOX) in 2002. For foreign ﬁrms to escape all the obligations they accept by listing on a U.S. Stock exchange they must delist from that exchange and terminate registration and reporting requirements (or “deregister”) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); without deregistering, a foreign ﬁrm is still subject to U.S. Securities laws. Until recently, deregistration was very difﬁcult. However, on March 21, 2007, the SEC adopted a new",

    "title": "Why Do Investors Hold Socially Responsible",
    "abstract": "To understand why investors hold socially responsible mutual funds, we link ad- ministrative data to survey responses and behavior in incentivized experiments. We ﬁnd that both social preferences and social signaling explain socially responsible in- vestment (SRI) decisions. Financial motives play less of a role. Socially responsible investors in our sample expect to earn lower returns on SRI funds than on con- ventional funds and pay higher management fees. This suggests that investors are willing to forgo ﬁnancial performance in order to invest in accordance with their social preferences. Socially Responsible Investments (SRIs) are increasing in economic and ﬁ- nancial importance, as testiﬁed by their growing volume in Europe and the United States (eurosif (2014), Social Investment Forum (SIF,2014)). In the United States, for instance, already one in nine dollars of professionally managed assets are involved in SRI. These investments are a puzzle in ﬁ- nance, however, because they deviate from the market by excluding potentially high-return “sin” companies from their portfolio or by focusing on companies Preferences and Portfolio Choice.” We are grateful to Robeco for providing us with the administra- tive data used in this paper and we particularly thank Peter Jurriaans, Catrien Kleinheerenbrink, Manon Middelink, and Jorg Sunderman.

    "title": "Why Do Managers Diversify Their Firms?",
    "abstract": "We develop a contracting model between shareholders and managers in which managers diversify their firms for two reasons: to reduce idiosyncratic risk and to capture private benefits. We test the comparative static predictions of our model. In contrast to previous work, we find that diversification is posi- tively related to managerial incentives. Further, the link between firm perfor- mance and managerial incentives is weaker for firms that experience changes in diversification than it is for firms that do not. Our findings suggest that managers diversify their firms in response to changes in private benefits rather than to reduce their exposure to risk. WHY DO Managers Choose to diversify their firms? A sizable literature suggests that corporate diversification is a leading example of the agency relationship be- tween shareholders and managers developed by Jensen and Meckling (1976). Agency theory argues that, because managers are not full residual claimants, they make decisions that increase their utility while potentially decreasing the value of the firm. There are two prominent types of agency explanations for why managers choose to diversify their firms. The first type of agency explanation is that managers derive utility from redu- cing the idiosyncratic risk that they face. Managers typically have large, undiver- sified positions in their own firms.1 Managers with higher equity ownership face higher idiosyncratic risk from incentives and therefore diversify their firm",

    "title": "Why Do Mutual Fund Advisory Contracts",
    "abstract": "We examine changes in equity mutual funds’ investment advisory contracts. We ﬁnd substantial advisory compensation rate changes in both directions, with typical per- centage fee shifts exceeding one-fourth. Rate increases are associated with superior past market-adjusted performance, whereas rate decreases reﬂect economies of scale associated with growth, and are not associated with extreme poor performance. There are within-family spillover effects. Superior (e.g., star) performance for individual funds is associated with rate increases for a family’s other funds. Rate reductions post-2004 by family funds involved in market timing scandals do not have large industry spillover effects. This Paper Examines changes in equity mutual funds’ investment advisory con- tracts. Advisory contracts generally pay the advisor a fee that is a percentage of the fund’s total net assets (TNA). These fees are substantial. For example, the median annual fee is roughly 80 basis points in our sample, representing about half of total expenses. The paper is the ﬁrst to document changes in the advisory rate speciﬁed in the contract, and to test hypotheses about changes in marginal compensation rates. Our analysis yields insights into price setting in the mutual fund industry, as well as into the contract evaluation and renewal process used by fund boards. This evaluation process has come under scrutiny by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which in 2004 proposed new rules for the annual c",

    "title": "Why Do U.S. Firms Hold So Much More Cash",
    "abstract": "The average cash-to-assets ratio for U.S. Industrial firms more than doubles from 1980 to 2006. A measure of the economic importance of this increase is that at the end of the sample period, the average firm can retire all debt obligations with its cash holdings. Cash ratios increase because firms’ cash flows become riskier. In addition, firms change: They hold fewer inventories and receivables and are increasingly R&D intensive. While the precautionary motive for cash holdings plays an important role in explaining the increase in cash ratios, we find no consistent evidence that agency conflicts contribute to the increase. Considerable Media Attention has been devoted to the increase in cash holdings of U.S. Firms. For instance, a recent article inThe Wall Street Journalstates that “The piles of cash and stockpile of repurchased shares at [big U.S. Companies] have hit record levels.”1 In this paper, we investigate how the cash holdings of U.S. Firms have evolved since 1980 and whether this evolution can be explained by changes in known determinants of cash holdings. We document a secular increase in the cash holdings of the typical firm from 1980 to 2006. In a re- gression of the average cash-to-assets ratio on a constant and time, time has a significantly positive coefficient, implying that the average cash-to-assets ratio (the cash ratio) has increased by 0.46% per year. Another way to see this evolu- tion is that the average cash ratio more than doubles over our sample per",

    "title": "Why Does Return Predictability Concentrate",
    "abstract": "We build an equilibrium model to explain why stock return predictability concentrates in bad times. The key feature is that investors use different forecasting models, and hence assess uncertainty differently. As economic conditions deteriorate, uncertainty rises and investors’ opinions polarize. Disagreement thus spikes in bad times, causing returns to react to past news. This phenomenon creates a positive relation between disagreement and future returns. It also generates time-series momentum, which strengthens in bad times, increases with disagreement, and crashes after sharp mar- ket rebounds. We provide empirical support for these new predictions. From THE Perspective OF THE Efficient Market hypothesis, one of the most important paradigms in ﬁnance, evidence of stock return predictability is a puzzle. Leading theories explain how investors may form beliefs that lead to deviations from efﬁciency, focusing on unconditional patterns in stock returns. 1 However, mounting evidence shows that return predictability ﬂuctuates over gleton and two anonymous referees for their insightful suggestions and comments.

    "abstract": "Investor protection is associated with greater investment sensitivity toq and lower investment sensitivity to cash ﬂow. Finance plays a role in causing these effects; in countries with strong investor protection, external ﬁnance increases more strongly with q, and declines more strongly with cash ﬂow. We further ﬁnd thatq and cash ﬂow sensitivities are associated with ex post investment efﬁciency; investment pre- dicts growth and proﬁts more strongly in countries with greaterq sensitivities and lower cash ﬂow sensitivities. The paper’s ﬁndings are broadly consistent with investor protection promoting accurate share prices, reducing ﬁnancial constraints, and en- couraging efﬁcient investment. IN This Paper , WE study how investor protection affects ﬁrm-level resource that stock prices more strongly predict both investment and external ﬁnance in countries with stronger investor protection laws.Tobin (1969) shows in a frictionless setting that marginalq predicts real investment. In this framework high marginalq ﬁrms should, all else equal, also raise the most capital as these ﬁrms invest more. We use averageq (q) as a proxy for marginalq, and test whether investment and external ﬁnance are more sensitive toq in countries with stronger investor protection laws. We base our ﬁrst hypothesis on three assumptions. First, we assume that investor protection laws encourage more accurate ﬁnancial reporting (Leuz, Nanda, and Wysocki (2003)) and more arbitrage (Morck, Yeung, and Yu (2000))",

    "title": "Why Don’t U.S. Issuers Demand European Fees",
    "abstract": "We compare fees charged by investment banks for conducting IPOs in the United States and Europe. In recent years, the “7% solution,” as documented by Chen and Ritter (2000), has become even more prevalent in the United States, and is now the norm for IPOs raising up to $250 million. The same banks dominate both markets, but European IPO fees are roughly three percentage points lower, are much more variable, and have been falling. We review explanations for the gap in spreads and ﬁnd the evidence consistent with strategic pricing. U.S. Issuers could have saved over $1 billion a year by paying European fees. Over 10 Years AGO, Chen and Ritter (2000) documented that IPO issuers in the United States almost always pay a gross spread of exactly 7% of proceeds to the underwriting syndicate for IPOs of between $20 million and $80 million. This evidence on the clustering of fees prompted an investigation by the U.S. Depart- ment of Justice, although this was ultimately dropped for lack of evidence of explicit collusion. A class-action antitrust lawsuit was also launched, and was settled privately after a 2007 appeals court decision allowing the claim against the underwriters to proceed. 1 Chen and Ritter cautioned that explicit collu- sion was unlikely, but concluded that the clustering of fees is consistent with implicit collusion—or “strategic pricing”—on the part of investment bankers. Subsequent papers by Hansen (2001) and Torstila (2003) argue against even implicit collusion. Han",

    "abstract": "We study sources of investor disagreement using sentiment of investors from a so- cial media investing platform, combined with information on the users’ investment approaches (e.g., technical, fundamental). We examine how much of overall disagree- ment is driven by different information sets versus differential interpretation of infor- mation by studying disagreement within and across investment approaches. Overall disagreement is evenly split between both sources of disagreement, but within-group disagreement is more tightly related to trading volume than cross-group disagree- ment. Although both sources of disagreement are important, our ﬁndings suggest that information differences are more important for trading than differences across market approaches. Disagreement Among Investors HAS Long been thought to be central to trading in ﬁnancial markets. Indeed, it is difﬁcult to explain why investors would trade at all without some source of disagreement (Milgrom and Stokey ( 1982), Karpoff ( 1986)).

In emerging markets, skewness is mostly positive and idiosyncratic, and sig- niﬁcantly relates to a country’s ﬁnancial and trade opennes s and balance of payments. In an international portfolio setting, return asymmetry le ads to sizeable certainty- equivalent gains and increases the weight on emerging count ries to about 30%.

We distinguish between firms that experienced relationship termination as a consequence of bank M&As and those that did not. Our findings are consistent with bank M&As having an adverse effect on credit, particu- larly when the M&A is followed by relationship termination. The effect persists 3 years and then is absorbed, suggesting that firms are able to compensate for the negative shock.

The empirical literature on bank M&As studies extensively the effects of consolidation on bank performance and local market conditions, particularly in terms of efficiency and market power (see Berger, Demsetz, and Strahan (1999), Amel et al.

    "title": "Women in Charge: Evidence from Hospitals",
    "abstract": "The paper examines the decision-making, compensation, and turnover of female CEOs in U.S. Hospitals. Contrary to the literature on lower-ranked executives and directors in public ﬁrms, there is no evidence that gender differences in preferences for risk or altruism affect decision-making of hospital CEOs: corporate policies do not shift when women take (or leave) ofﬁce, and male and female CEOs respond similarly to a major ﬁnancial shock. However, female CEOs earn lower salaries, face ﬂatter pay-for-performance incentives, and exhibit greater turnover after poor performance. Hospital boards behave as though they perceive female CEOs as less productive. Women Make UP 47% OF the U.S. Labor force, yet top executive jobs are held predominantly by men. For example, in 2024, only 6% of S&P 500 CEOs were women. This low share is striking since women are increasingly well-educated and hold a growing fraction of lower-level management jobs. This paper sheds light on this persistent gap by examining an important and relatively homoge- nous industry—the U.S. Hospital sector—in which female CEOs are relatively common. The goal is to offer a comprehensive picture of the decision-making, compensation, and turnover of female CEOs in a major U.S. Industry over nearly two decades. The literature suggests several possible reasons for the low share of women among CEOs, including gender differences, stereotypes, career interruptions, and institutional barriers such as lack of networks and mentor",

    "title": "Women’s Liberation as a Financial Innovation",
    "abstract": "In one of the greatest extensions of property rights in human history, common law countries began giving rights to married women in the 1850s. Before this “women’s liberation,” the doctrine of coverture strongly incentivized parents of daughters to hold real estate, rather than ﬁnancial assets such as money, stocks, or bonds. We exploit the staggered nature of coverture’s demise across U.S. States to show that women’s rights led to shifts in household portfolios, a positive shock to the supply of credit, and a reallocation of labor toward nonagriculture and capital-intensive industries. Investor protection thus deepened ﬁnancial markets, aiding industrialization. “It was now proposed that, for the ﬁrst time in our history, the property of one-half of the married people of this country should receive the protection of the law. Up to this time the property of a wife had had no protection from the law . . . ” MP Russell Gurney, during the debate on the Married Women’s Property Act of 1870.

    "abstract": "Information and control rights are central aspects of leadership, management, and corporate governance. This paper studies a principal-agent model that features both communication and intervention as alternative means to exert inﬂuence. The main result shows that a principal’s power to intervene in an agent’s decision limits the ability of the principal to effectively communicate her private information. The per- verse effect of intervention on communication can harm the principal, especially when the cost of intervention is low or the underlying agency problem is severe. These novel results are applied to managerial leadership, corporate boards, private equity, and shareholder activism. Actions speak louder than words, but not nearly as often. —Mark Twain Information AND Control Rights AREcentral aspects of leadership, manage- ment, and corporate governance. In practice, communication of private infor- mation and intervention in the decision-making process are common remedies for information asymmetries and conﬂicts of interest in a wide range of sit- uations. The interplay between communication and intervention, however, is little understood. In this paper, I show that the power of a principal to inter- vene in an agent’s decision exacerbates the underlying agency problem and as a result limits the ability of the principal to use her private information to inﬂuence the agent’s decision. The power to intervene can therefore be detri- mental to the principal. This novel resul",

    "title": "Work Ethic, Employment Contracts,",
    "abstract": "We analyze how the work ethic of managers impacts a firm’s employment contracts, riskiness, growth potential, and organizational structure. Flat contracts are optimal for diligent managers because they reduce risk-sharing costs, but they attract ego- istic agents who shirk and unskilled agents who add no value. Stable, bureaucratic firms with low growth potential are more likely to gain value from managerial dili- gence. Firms that hire from a virtuous pool of agents are more conservative in their investments and have a horizontal corporate structure. Our theory also yields several testable implications that distinguish it from standard agency models. Ever Since Berle AND Means (1932) recognized that the separation of ownership and control impacts firm value, economists have focused on ways to mitigate the agency problems that arise between shareholders and managers. Agency theory is now ubiquitous in corporate finance as an important determinant of firm size, capital structure, corporate governance, and firm value. Traditionally, agency theory is founded on the principle that managers are egoistic and must be given incentives to act in the best interests of the firm. 2 However, this framework largely ignores the possibility that some managers are innately diligent and do not pose a moral hazard threat. This shortcoming is highlighted by Brennan (1994), who argues that there is a significant differ- ence between being rational and being self-interested. That is, to assume tha",

    "abstract": "The voluntary departure of hard-to-replace skilled workers worsens ﬁrm prospects, which can lead to additional departures. We develop a model in which ﬁrms design compensation to limit the risk of such “worker runs.” To achieve cost-efﬁcient reten- tion, ﬁrms combine ﬁxed wages with dilutable compensation—such as vesting equity or bonus pools—which pays remaining workers more when others leave but gets di- luted otherwise. Compensating (identical) workers with differently structured com- pensation, that is, with a different mix of output-dependent and output-independent pay , can further mitigate the risk of worker runs by ensuring a critical retention level in a cost-efﬁcient way . ﬁght to stem the exodus of senior and junior employees across multiple divisions. The trigger for these departures was the bank’s exposure to the spectacular collapses of Archegos and Greensill Capital, which dented its proﬁts. Senior bankers who were not involved in these affairs, and whose divisions would have otherwise led the bank to a record quarterly proﬁt, were reportedly furious, prompting them to leave.

    "title": "Working More to Pay the Mortgage: Household",
    "abstract": "I show that households work and earn more (less) when their ﬂoating-rate mortgage payments quasi-exogenously increase (decrease). The response is sizable and asym- metric: on average, households adjust their income by 35% of the change in their mortgage payment, but the response is signiﬁcantly stronger following an increase in payments. While men in dual-earner, childless households respond the most on average, the asymmetry is most pronounced for women and young workers, who re- spond particularly strongly to payment increases. The asymmetry of the labor supply When Changes IN Interest Rates lead to changes in mortgage payments, households may respond by adjusting their consumption or labor supply. Ad- justments along either of these margins can signiﬁcantly impact the real econ- omy and the transmission of monetary policy (Bernanke and Gertler ( 1995), Adelino, Schoar, and Severino ( 2018)), but evidence regarding how consump- tion adjusts is much more extensive (Di Maggio et al. ( 2017), Jappelli and Scog- namiglio (2018), Cloyne, Ferreira, and Surico ( 2020)) than that concerning the response of labor supply. Basic theoretical models predict that households work and earn more when their debt payments are higher (Manso et al. ( 2022)). The magnitude of this positive response depends, however, on the elasticity of labor supply. Existing studies provide a wide range of estimates for this elasticity but offer little insight into the reasons for such variation or its relation",

    "title": "Working Orders in Limit Order Markets",
    "abstract": "We analyze limit order markets and floor exchanges, assuming an informed trader and discretionary liquidity traders use market orders and can either submit block orders or work their demands as a series of small orders. By working their demands, large market order traders pool with small traders. We show that every equilibrium on a floor exchange must involve at least partial pooling. Moreover, there is always a fully pooling (worked order) equilibrium on a floor exchange that is equivalent to a block order equilibrium in a limit order market. THE Goal OF This Paper IS TO Compare Alternative Market designs. Glosten (1994) shows that a market with an open limit order book is robust to competition from other markets. Our principal result is that other market types may mimic an open limit order book and hence have the same robustness. In particular, following Glosten (1994) and assuming perfect competition among risk-neutral liquidity providers, a uniform price auction has an equilibrium that is equiva- lent in all important respects to the equilibrium of an open limit order book. We argue below that uniform pricing is an essential feature of a floor exchange, and thus an equivalence between (stylized models of) limit order markets and floor exchanges obtains. In these stylized models, the distinction between limit order markets and floor exchanges is that pricing in a limit order market is discrim- inatory (each limit order executes at its limit price rather than the marginal p",

    "abstract": "Using individual patient records for every hospital in California from 1983 to 2011, we ﬁnd a strong inverse link between daily stock returns and hospital admissions, particularly for psychological conditions such as anxiety, panic disorder, and major depression. The effect is nearly instantaneous (within the same day) for psychological conditions, suggesting thatanticipation over future consumption directly inﬂuences instantaneous utility. Most Papers IN Behavioral ASSETpricing explore how investor psychology in- ﬂuences stock prices. In this paper, we ask the opposite question. Using three decades of daily hospital admission data for the state of California, we measure the extent to which, and how quickly, stock market ﬂuctuations impact investor psychology. There are at least three reasons to care about the answer to these questions. First, to the extent that behavioral inﬂuences are important determinants of prices, then anything that induces large, widespread changes in investor psy- chology is ultimately in the domain of economics.1 Put differently, even taking as given Hamoudi and Sachs’s (1999) claim that “human well-being is inar- guably an end unto itself,” psychological distress among investors is especially relevant for ﬁnancial economists, for whom the process of price formation is of central importance.

    "abstract": "We model two methods of executing segregated retail orders: brokers’ routing, whereby brokers allocate orders using the market maker’s overall performance, and order-by-order auctions, where market makers bid on individual orders, a recent U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission proposal. Order-by-order auctions improve al- locative efﬁciency, but face a winner’s curse reducing retail investor welfare, partic- ularly when liquidity is limited. Additional market participants competing for retail orders fail to improve total efﬁciency and investor welfare when entrants possess in- formation superior to incumbent wholesalers. Our results hold when new entrants are less informed or the information structure differs. We also examine the cross- subsidization of brokers’ routing. Retail Order Flow IN U.S. Equities is segregated, with retail brokers routing almost all of their retail customer orders directly to market makers.

    "abstract": "We study the effect of subjective mortality beliefs on life-cycle behavior. With new survey evidence, we document that survival is underestimated (overestimated) by the young (old). We calibrate a canonical life-cycle model to elicited beliefs. Rela- tive to calibrations using actuarial probabilities, the young undersave by 26%, and retirees draw down their assets 27% slower, while the model’s ﬁt to consumption data improves by 88%. Cross-sectional regressions support the model’s predictions: Distorted mortality beliefs correlate with savings behavior while controlling for risk preferences, cognitive, and socioeconomic factors. Overweighting the likelihood of rare events contributes to mortality belief distortions. Expectations About Future Events ARE Crucial to intertemporal decision- making. The economic literature reveals, however, that consumer expectations often fail to align with the correct probabilities. One way in which individuals err in the formation of expectations is by systematically overweighting rare events with salient attributes (Bordalo, Gennaioli, and Shleifer ( 2012, 2016)). Motivated by this observation, we consider how the formation of mortality beliefs inﬂuences household ﬁnancial decision-making. Low probability events have the potential to distort individuals’ mortality beliefs and consequently affect economic behavior. For example, although sharks kill only one person per year on average in the United States (cows kill 20 people per year), many Yolo",

    "abstract": "Many believe that compensation, misaligned from shareholders’ value due to man- agerial entrenchment, caused ﬁnancial ﬁrms to take risks before the ﬁnancial crisis of 2008. We argue that, even in a classical principal-agent setting without entrenchment and with exogenous ﬁrm risk, riskier ﬁrms may offer higher total pay as compensation for the extra risk in equity stakes borne by risk-averse managers. Using long lags of stock price risk to capture exogenous ﬁrm risk, we conﬁrm our conjecture and show that riskier ﬁrms are also more productive and more likely to be held by institutional investors, who are most able to inﬂuence compensation. Many Blame Wall Street Compensation for the most signiﬁcant economic crisis since the Great Depression. For instance, in his testimony to Congress on the Treasury budget on June 9, 2009, Treasury Secretary Geithner argues, “I think, although many things caused this crisis, what happened to compensation and the incentives that created risk taking did contribute in some institutions to the kind of vulnerability we saw in this ﬁnancial crisis” (emphasis added) 1. As a result, U.S. Policy makers have promoted reforms to tie pay to long-term performance and increase the say of shareholders in approving compensation and electing directors on compensation committees. The view that incentive misalignment contributed to the crisis is shared by many other governments as well. 2 version titled “Yesterday’s Heroes: Compensation and Creative Risk-Taking",

Markets affected by a rise in zombie credit experience lower ﬁrm entry and exit, capacity utilization, markups, and inﬂation, as well as a misallocation of capital and labor, which results in lower productivity, investment, and value added.

    "abstract": "Because uncertainty is high in bad times, investors ﬁnd it harder to assess ﬁrm prospects and hence should value analyst output more. However, higher uncertainty makes analysts’ tasks harder, so it is unclear whether analyst output is more valuable in bad times. We ﬁnd that in bad times, analyst revisions have a larger stock-price impact, earnings forecast errors per unit of uncertainty fall, and analyst reports are more frequent and longer. The increased impact of analysts is also more pronounced for harder-to-value ﬁrms. These results are consistent with analysts working harder and investors relying more on analysts in bad times. While There IS A Large Literature ON sell-side analysts’ role as information intermediaries, this literature mostly ignores the question of whether the state of the economy affects the value of analyst output for investors. 1 There are good reasons to believe that the usefulness and performance of sell-side analysts depend on the state of the economy.

    "abstract": "During the past few decades, the fraction of the equity market owned directly by individuals declined signiﬁcantly. The same period witnessed investment trends that include the growth of indexing as well as shifts by active managers toward lower fees and more index-like investing. I develop an equilibrium model linking these in- vestment trends to the decline in individual ownership, interpreting the latter as a reduction in noise trading. Active management corrects most noise trader–induced mispricing, and the fraction left uncorrected shrinks as noise traders’ stake in the market declines. Less mispricing then dictates a smaller footprint for active manage- ment. Noise Trading HAS Been a familiar concept in ﬁnance since the 1980s. In the following decades, noise traders have increasingly populated the ﬁnance lit- erature, but their real-life presence in the stock market may have declined. Why? First, noise trading is more often associated with individuals than in- stitutions. Fischer Black describes noise traders as “people who trade. . . Even though from an objective point of view they would be better off not trading.”1 The behavioral ﬁnance literature points to numerous factors that lead indi- viduals to make unproductive investment decisions.

This dissonance is at least partly explained by an underappreciation by academia of how, without proper rules, ﬁnance can easily degenerate into a rent-seeking activity. I educational point of view, to promote good ﬁnance and minimize the bad. FOR Most Academic Economists the answer to the question raised in the title seems obvious. After all, there are plenty of theories that explain the crucial role played by the ﬁnancial sector: from managing risk (Froot, Scharfstein, and Stein (1993)) to providing valuable price signals (Hayek (1945); Holmstrom and Tirole ( 1993)), from monitoring (Diamond ( 1984)) to designing securities that alleviate informational asymmetries (Myers and Majluf ( 1984)). Furthermore, there appears to be plenty of evidence that ﬁnance is positively associated with growth (e.g., Levine ( 2005)) and entrepreneurship (Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales ( 2004), Mollica and Zingales ( 2008)), and even with better education (Flug, Spilimbergo, and Wachtenheim (1998), Levine and Rubinstein ( 2014)), and less inequality (Beck, Demirg ¨uc¸-Kunt, and Levine ( 2007)).

I introduce a novel corporate ﬁnance framing of sovereign ﬁnance based on the analogy between ﬁat liabilities for sovereigns and equity for corpo- rations. The analysis focuses on ﬁnancial constraints at the country level, making explicit the trade-offs involved in relying on domestic versus foreign-currency debt to ﬁnance investments or government expenditures. This framing provides new insights into issues ranging from the costs and beneﬁts of inﬂation, optimal foreign exchange reserves, and sovereign debt restructuring. Finance HAS Taken A Beating lately.

    "title": "“Time for a Change”: Loan Conditions and Bank",
    "abstract": "This paper studies loan conditions when ﬁrms switch banks. Recent theoretical work on bank–ﬁrm relationships motivates our matching models. The dynamic cycle of the loan rate that we uncover is as follows: a loan granted by a new (outside) bank carries a loan rate that is signiﬁcantly lower than the rates on comparable new loans from the ﬁrm’s current (inside) banks. The new bank initially decreases the loan rate further but eventually ratchets it up sharply. Other loan conditions follow a similar economically relevant pattern. This bank strategy is consistent with the existence of hold-up costs in bank–ﬁrm relationships. Turning TO A NEW Bank IS A Defining MOMENTfor both the ﬁrm and its current lenders, and is hence a strategic decision often taken at the highest level. Consequently, a number of recent theoretical models study a ﬁrm’s decision to switch. Yet, while academics and industry observers point to switching costs as a key source of bank rents, there is surprisingly little empirical evidence on contract conditions just before and after a ﬁrm switches to a new bank. An analysis of loan conditions is a ﬁrst—but essential—step in assessing the role that switching costs play in credit markets. Our paper makes this ﬁrst step.
