    "abstract": "This paper studies loan conditions when ﬁrms switch banks. Recent theoretical work\non bank–ﬁrm relationships motivates our matching models. The dynamic cycle of\nthe loan rate that we uncover is as follows: a loan granted by a new (outside) bank\ncarries a loan rate that is signiﬁcantly lower than the rates on comparable new loans\nfrom the ﬁrm’s current (inside) banks. The new bank initially decreases the loan rate\nfurther but eventually ratchets it up sharply. Other loan conditions follow a similar\neconomically relevant pattern. This bank strategy is consistent with the existence of\nhold-up costs in bank–ﬁrm relationships.\nTURNING TO A NEW BANK IS A DEFINING MOMENTfor both the ﬁrm and its current\nlenders, and is hence a strategic decision often taken at the highest level.\nConsequently, a number of recent theoretical models study a ﬁrm’s decision to\nswitch. Yet, while academics and industry observers point to switching costs\nas a key source of bank rents, there is surprisingly little empirical evidence\non contract conditions just before and after a ﬁrm switches to a new bank. An\nanalysis of loan conditions is a ﬁrst—but essential—step in assessing the role\nthat switching costs play in credit markets.

    "abstract": "Although a number of prior papers have argued the benefits to foreign firms of cross-\nlisting their shares in the U.S., the number of foreign firms exiting U.S. capital markets\nhas been increasing. This has occurred despite the difficulties foreign firms face in\nderegistering from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This paper exam-\nines the reasons underlying this trend. One of our main findings is that the passage of\nthe Sarbanes-Oxley Act has reduced the net benefits of a U.S. listing and registration,\nparticularly for smaller foreign firms with lower trading volume and stronger insider\ncontrol.\nIN RECENT YEARS NEARLY 150 FOREIGN FIRMS have sought to exit U.S. equity mar-\nkets. Most of these firms have voluntarily delisted from one of the major U.S.\nexchanges and announced their intention to deregister from the Securities and\nExchange Commission (SEC). Moreover, an increasing number of firms with\nAmerican Depositary Receipt (ADR) programs are terminating their deposi-\ntary agreements. Once deregistered, foreign firms need not produce U.S. GAAP\ncompliant financial reports and are no longer subject to the governance and dis-\nclosure regulations introduced under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX).\nWhile a large number of papers have been concerned with explaining the\nadvantages to foreign firms of issuing securities and cross-listing in the U.S.\n(e.g., Bailey, Karolyi, and Salva (2006) and Lins, Strickland, and Zenner (2005)),\nthis is the first paper to analyze fo",

    "abstract": "Traditional real options models demonstrate the importance of the “option to wait”\ndue to uncertainty over future shocks to project cash ﬂows. However, there is often\nanother important source of uncertainty: uncertainty over the permanence of past\nshocks. Adding Bayesian uncertainty over the permanence of past shocks augments\nthe traditional option to wait with an additional “option to learn.” The implied in-\nvestment behavior differs signiﬁcantly from that in standard models. For example,\ninvestment may occur at a time of stable or decreasing cash ﬂows, respond sluggishly\nto cash ﬂow shocks, and depend on the timing of project cash ﬂows.\nDURING THE PAST TWO DECADES the real options approach to valuation of irre-\nversible investment opportunities has become part of the mainstream litera-\nture in ﬁnancial economics. The central idea is that the opportunity to invest\nis equivalent to an American call option on the underlying investment project.\nAs a consequence, the problem of optimal investment timing is analogous to\nthe optimal exercise decision for an American option. Applications of the real\noptions approach are now numerous.\n1\nOne feature that is common to virtually all real options models is that the\nunderlying uncertainty pertains only to future shocks.

    "abstract": "We propose that the decision to pay dividends is driven by prevailing investor demand\nfor dividend payers. Managers cater to investors by paying dividends when investors\nput a stock price premium on payers, and by not paying when investors prefer nonpay-\ners. To test this prediction, we construct four stock price-based measures of investor\ndemand for dividend payers. By each measure, nonpayers tend to initiate dividends\nwhen demand is high. By some measures, payers tend to omit dividends when demand\nis low. Further analysis confirms that these results are better explained by catering\nthan other theories of dividends.\nMILLER AND MODIGILIANI (1961) prove that dividend policy is irrelevant to share\nvalue in perfect and efficient capital markets. In that setup, no rational investor\nhas a preference between dividends and capital gains. Arbitrage ensures that\ndividend policy is irrelevant.\nForty-plus years later, the only assumption in this proof that has not been\nthoroughly scrutinized is market efficiency.\n1 In this paper, we argue for a view\nof dividends that relaxes this assumption. It has three basic ingredients. First,\nfor either psychological or institutional reasons, some investors have an unin-\nformed and perhaps time-varying demand for dividend-paying stocks. Second,\narbitrage fails to prevent this demand from driving apart the prices of payers\nand nonpayers.

    "abstract": "We study optimal government debt maturity in a model where investors derive mon-\netary services from holding riskless short-term securities. In a setting where the\ngovernment is the only issuer of such riskless paper, it trades off the monetary pre-\nmium associated with short-term debt against the reﬁnancing risk implied by the\nneed to roll over its debt more often. We extend the model to allow private ﬁnan-\ncial intermediaries to compete with the government in the provision of short-term\nmoney-like claims. We argue that, if there are negative externalities associated with\nprivate money creation, the government should tilt its issuance more toward short\nmaturities, thereby partially crowding out the private sector’s use of short-term debt.\nIN THIS PAPER, we study how the government should optimally determine the\nmaturity structure of its debt. We focus on situations in which there is no ques-\ntion about the government’s ability to service its obligations, so the analysis\nshould be thought of as applying to countries like the United States that are of\nexceptionally high credit quality.1 The primary novelty of our approach is that\nwe emphasize the monetary beneﬁts that investors derive from holding risk-\nless short-term securities, such as Treasury bills.

While banks honored credit lines drawn by ﬁrms during the 2007 to 2009\ncrisis, this liquidity provision was only possible because of explicit, large support from\nthe government and government-sponsored agencies. At the onset of the crisis, aggre-\ngate deposit inﬂows into banks weakened and their loan-to-deposit shortfalls widened.\nThese patterns were pronounced at banks with greater undrawn commitments.

We document that when the\ngovernment funds itself with more short-term debt, ﬁrms ﬁll the resulting gap by\nissuing more long-term debt, and vice versa. This type of liquidity provision is under-\ntaken more aggressively: (1) when the ratio of government debt to total debt is higher\nand (2) by ﬁrms with stronger balance sheets. Our theory sheds new light on market\ntiming phenomena in corporate ﬁnance more generally.\nTHERE IS SUBSTANTIAL year-to-year variation in the average maturity of cor-\nporate debt issues. For example, usingFlow of Fundsdata from the Federal\nReserve, which cover all forms of borrowing, including both public and private,\nwe estimate that in 1999, 24.7% of nonﬁnancial corporate debt issues were\n“long term”—deﬁned as having a maturity of 1 year or more. This long-term\nshare fell sharply to 19.9% in 2000, and then bounced back to a new peak of\n30.1% in 2001.\nWhat accounts for these movements? There are a number of prominent the-\nories of debt maturity choice, but the majority of these theories focus on ﬁrm-\nlevel determinants and hence do not have clear-cut implications for aggregate\ntime-series behavior. One familiar idea is that ﬁrms should attempt to match\nthe maturities of their assets and liabilities (e.g., Myers (1977), Hart and Moore\n(1995)",

There is a repre- \nsentative agent who has risk preferences with an exponential representation. \nAggregate wealth and the underlying asset price have transformed normal \ndistributions which may or may not belong to the same family of distributions. \nThose pricing results are particularly valuable (a) to show new sufficient con- \nditions for existing risk-neutral option pricing equations (e.g., the Black- \nScholes model), and (b) to obtain new analytical solutions for the price of Eur- \nopean-style contingent claims when the underlying asset has a transformed \nnormal distribution (e.g., a negatively skew lognormal distribution). \nA FUNDAMENTAL RESULT in the valuation theory under uncertainty is that equili- \nbrium asset prices depend on investors' marginal utility functions.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a model that reproduces the uncovered interest rate parity puz-\nzle. Investors have preferences with external habits. Countercyclical risk premia and\nprocyclical real interest rates arise endogenously. During bad times at home, when\ndomestic consumption is close to the habit level, the representative investor is very\nrisk averse. When the domestic investor is more risk averse than her foreign coun-\nterpart, the exchange rate is closely tied to domestic consumption growth shocks.\nThe domestic investor therefore expects a positive currency excess return. Because\ninterest rates are low in bad times, expected currency excess returns increase with\ninterest rate differentials.\nACCORDING TO THE UNCOVERED INTEREST RATE PARITY (UIP) CONDITION, the ex-\npected change in exchange rates should be equal to the interest rate differen-\ntial between foreign and domestic risk-free bonds. The UIP condition implies\nthat a regression of exchange rate changes on interest rate differentials should\nproduce a slope coefﬁcient of one. Instead, empirical work following Hansen\nand Hodrick (1980) and Fama (1984) consistently reveals a slope coefﬁcient\nthat is smaller than one and very often negative. The international economics\nliterature refers to these negative UIP slope coefﬁcients as the UIP puzzle or\nforward premium anomaly.\nNegative slope coefﬁcients mean that currencies with higher than average\ninterest rates tend to appreciate, rather than depreciate as UIP would pre-\ndict.

    "abstract": "Growing evidence suggests that extraordinary average returns may be obtained by\ntrading equity index options, and that at least part of this abnormal performance is\nattributable to volatility and jump risk premia. This paper asks whether such priced\nrisk factors are alone sufficient to explain these average returns. To provide an answer\nin as general as possible a setting, I estimate a flexible class of nonlinear models using\nall S&P 500 Index futures options traded between 1986 and 2000. The results show\nthat priced factors contribute to these expected returns but are insufficient to explain\ntheir magnitudes, particularly for short-term out-of-the-money puts.\nIN A RECENT PAPER ,C OVAL AND SHUMWAY (2001) examine the returns on delta-\nhedged option positions, focusing on the at-the-money straddle, and find aver-\nage returns close to minus 3% per week. Since over short time horizons these\npositions are approximately invariant to movements in the underlying index,\nCoval and Shumway argue that their CAPM betas should be near zero and their\nexpected returns close to the risk-free rate. They conclude that large deviations\nfrom the CAPM are the norm, which they suggest is evidence that some other\nsystematic factor, such as stochastic volatility, might be priced by the market.\nSimilar conclusions are made by Jackwerth (2000), who finds risk-adjusted\nprofitability from selling puts, and by Bakshi and Kapadia (2003), who find\nthat the volatility risk premium contributes significantly t",

    "abstract": "We model a loop between sovereign and bank credit risk. A distressed ﬁnancial sector\ninduces government bailouts, whose cost increases sovereign credit risk. Increased\nsovereign credit risk in turn weakens the ﬁnancial sector by eroding the value of its\ngovernment guarantees and bond holdings. Using credit default swap (CDS) rates on\nEuropean sovereigns and banks, we show that bailouts triggered the rise of sovereign\ncredit risk in 2008. We document that post-bailout changes in sovereign CDS explain\nchanges in bank CDS even after controlling for aggregate and bank-level determi-\nnants of credit spreads, conﬁrming the sovereign-bank loop.\nPRIOR TO THE FINANCIAL CRISIS of 2007 to 2008, there was essentially no sign\nof sovereign credit risk in the developed economies, and the prevailing view\nwas that such risk was unlikely to be a concern for these economies in the\nnear future. However, since the fall of 2008 sovereign credit risk has become\na signiﬁcant problem for a number of developed countries, most notably in\nEurope. In this paper, we examine three closely related questions surrounding\nthis development. First, were the ﬁnancial sector bailouts an integral factor in\nigniting the rise of sovereign credit risk in the developed economies? We show\nthat they were.

Although the model allows contagion through several \nchannels, our focus is on contagion through cross-market rebalancing. Through \nthis channel, investors transmit idiosyncratic shocks from one market to others by \nadjusting their portfolios' exposures to shared macroeconomic risks.

Hence, the high–low ratio reﬂects\nboth the stock’s variance and its bid-ask spread. Although the variance component of\nthe high–low ratio is proportional to the return interval, the spread component is not.\nThis allows us to derive a spread estimator as a function of high–low ratios over 1-day\nand 2-day intervals. The estimator is easy to calculate, can be applied in a variety of\nresearch areas, and generally outperforms other low-frequency estimators.\nIN THIS PAPER , we derive a simple way to estimate bid-ask spreads from daily\nhigh and low prices. The estimator is based on two uncontroversial ideas.\nFirst, daily high prices are almost always buyer-initiated trades and daily\nlow prices are almost always seller-initiated trades. The ratio of high-to-low\nprices for a day therefore reﬂects both the fundamental volatility of the stock\nand its bid-ask spread. Second, the component of the high-to-low price ra-\ntio that is due to volatility increases proportionately with the length of the\ntrading interval, while the component due to bid-ask spreads does not.

When institutional investors are relatively less taxed than individ- \nual investors, dividends induce \"ownership clientele\" effects. Firms paying dividends \nattract relatively more institutions, which have a relative advantage in detecting \nhigh firm quality and in ensuring firms are well managed. The theory is consistent \nwith some documented regularities, specifically both the presence and stickiness of \ndividends, and offers novel empirical implications, e.g., a prediction that it is the \ntax difference between institutions and retail investors that determines dividend \npayments, not the absolute tax payments. \nALTHOUGH A NUMBER OF THEORIES have been put forward in the literature to \nexplain their pervasive presence,1 dividends remain one of the thorniest puz- \nzles in corporate finance. In a frictionless world without taxes or transaction \ncosts, dividends and share repurchases are equivalent.

We highlight several\npolicy implications of our analysis.\nToo much emphasis on monitoring tends to create a rift between non-\nexecutive and executive directors, whereas the more traditional job of\nforming strategy requires close collaboration. In both activities, though,\nindependent directors face the same problem: they depend largely on\nthe chief executive and the company’s management for information.

Moreover, the effects are more pro-\nnounced for ﬁrms that have a higher proportion of tangible assets because these\nﬁrms are more affected by the secured transactions law.

We\nﬁnd that perquisite consumption critically impacts cash policy. Size-based compensa-\ntion also matters, but less.

    "abstract": "This paper outlines and tests two agency models of dividends. According to the \n\"outcome model,\" dividends are paid because minority shareholders pressure cor- \nporate insiders to disgorge cash. According to the \"substitute model,\" insiders in- \nterested in issuing equity in the future pay dividends to establish a reputation for \ndecent treatment of minority shareholders. The first model predicts that stronger \nminority shareholder rights should be associated with higher dividend payouts; \nthe second model predicts the opposite. Tests on a cross section of 4,000 companies \nfrom 33 countries with different levels of minority shareholder rights support the \noutcome agency model of dividends. \nTHE SO-CALLED DIVIDEND PUZZLE (Black (1976)) has preoccupied the attention of \nfinancial economists at least since Modigliani and Miller's seminal work (see \nModigliani and Miller (1958) and Miller and Modigliani (1961)). This work \nestablished that, in a frictionless world, when the investment policy of a \nfirm is held constant, its dividend payout policy has no consequences for \nshareholder wealth. Higher dividend payouts lead to lower retained earn- \nings and capital gains, and vice versa, leaving total wealth of the sharehold- \ners unchanged. Contrary to this prediction, however, corporations follow \nextremely deliberate dividend payout strategies (Lintner (1956)). This evi- \ndence raises a puzzle: How do firms choose their dividend policies? \nIn the United States and other countries, ",

In the cross-section, ﬁrms owned by private\nequity funds average 40% smaller ﬂeets than observably similar public ﬁrms. Similar\nﬂeet reductions are observed within ﬁrms that undergo leveraged buyouts.

A\ntrade-off arises between the beneﬁt of always having the “right” manager and the\ncost of incentive provision. The prospect of growth-induced turnover limits the ﬁrm’s\nability to rely on deferred pay, resulting in more front-loaded compensation.

    "abstract": "The 30-year U.S. swap spreads have been negative since September 2008. We offer a\nnovel explanation for this persistent anomaly. Through an illustrative model, we show\nthat underfunded pension plans optimally use swaps for duration hedging. Combined\nwith dealer banks’ balance sheet constraints, this demand can drive swap spreads to\nbecome negative. Empirically, we construct a measure of the aggregate funding status\nof deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans and show that this measure helps explain 30-year\nswap spreads. We ﬁnd a similar link between pension funds’ underfunding and swap\nspreads for two other regions.\nIN SEPTEMBER 2008, SHORTLY AFTER THE default of Lehman Brothers, the differ-\nence between the swap rate (which is the ﬁxed rate in the swap) of a 30-year in-\nterest rate swap (IRS) and the yield of a Treasury bond with the same maturity,\ncommonly referred to as swap spread, dropped sharply and became negative.\nAs we explain in more detail later, this is a theoretical arbitrage opportunity\nand an asset pricing anomaly. In contrast to other crisis phenomena, the 30-\nyear negative swap spread has been highly persistent, still at around −40 basis\npoints as of December 2015. In this paper, we examine the persistent negative\n30-year swap spread and offer a new perspective on the possible reasons behind\nthis anomaly. Our hypothesis is that demand for duration hedging by under-\nfunded pension plans coupled with the balance sheet constraints faced by swap\ndealers put pressure on long-t",

    "abstract": "This paper documents a close link between mispricing and liquidity by investigating\nstocks with high analyst disagreement. Previous research finds that these stocks tend\nto be overpriced, but that prices correct downwards as uncertainty about earnings is\nresolved. Our analysis suggests that one reason mispricing has persisted through the\nyears is that analyst disagreement coincides with high trading costs. We also show\nthat in the cross-section, the less liquid stocks tend to be more severely overpriced.\nAdditionally, increases in aggregate market liquidity accelerate the convergence of\nprices to fundamentals. As a result, returns of the initially overpriced stocks are\nnegatively correlated with the time series of innovations in aggregate market liquidity.\nTHE FINANCE LITERATURE HAS LONG QUESTIONED whether mispricing can persist in a\nwell-functioning economy. Friedman (1953) argues that prices must reflect fun-\ndamental values because even if irrational investors misvalue a security, ratio-\nnal profit-seeking investors will trade against the mispricing, thereby pushing\nprices back to fundamentals. Others, however, show that prices may persis-\ntently diverge from their fundamental values when the trading costs exceed\npotential profits (see, for example, Shiller (1984), De Long et al. (1990), and\nShleifer (2000)).

Second, analysts\nstrategically deliver downward-biased forecasts to increase their consistency (if at the\nexpense of stated accuracy). Finally , the beneﬁts of consistency and of “lowballing”\n(accuracy) are increasing (decreasing) in institutional investors’ presence.\nBECAUSE OF THE LARGE demand for ﬁnancial analysts’ earnings forecasts, re-\nsearchers have long been interested in how analyst forecast characteristics\naffect price formation and analysts’ career development.

    "abstract": "This paper develops a theory of strategic trading in markets with large arbitrageurs.\nIf arbitrageurs are not well capitalized, capital constraints make their trades pre-\ndictable. Other market participants can exploit this by trading against them. Com-\npetitors may find it optimal to lend to arbitrageurs that are financially fragile; addi-\ntional capital makes the arbitrageurs more viable, and lenders can reap profits from\ntrading against them for a longer time. The strategic behavior of these market partici-\npants has implications for the functioning of financial markets. Strategic trading may\nproduce significant price distortions, increase price manipulation, and trigger forced\nliquidations of large traders.\nIN MANY FINANCIAL AND COMMODITY MARKETS a few large players account for a signif-\nicant fraction of the trading volume. These large players are often arbitrageurs\nbecause their primary activity involves taking large positions to profit from\nsmall mispricings.\nThe presence of large players is usually well known to market participants.\nIn some cases this is the result of reputation built over time. Examples include\nYasuo Hamanaka, the Sumitomo trader once known as “Mr. Five Percent”\namong copper traders to reflect its holdings of 5% of the total copper market;\nLong-Term Capital Management (LTCM), which was referred to as the “Cen-\ntral Bank of Volatility” because of its large short positions in equity derivatives;\nMetallgesellschaft, which was known as the largest “Wall ",

We evaluate these theories using the\nmarket for outside directorships to differentiate among inside directors. Firms with\ninside directors holding outside directorships have better operating performance and\nmarket-to-book ratios, especially when monitoring is more difﬁcult. These ﬁrms make\nbetter acquisition decisions, have greater cash holdings, and overstate earnings less\noften.

Moreover, the prices of MBS\nsold by large issuers drop more than those sold by small issuers, and the differences\nare concentrated among tranches issued during 2004 to 2006.

    "abstract": "We argue that some powerful CEOs induce boards to shift the weight on performance\nmeasures toward the better performing measures, therebyrigging incentive pay. A\nsimple model formalizes this intuition and gives an explicit structural form on the\nrigged incentive portion of CEO wage function. Using U.S. data, we ﬁnd support\nfor the model’s predictions: rigging accounts for at least 10% of the compensation to\nperformance sensitivity and it increases with CEO human capital and ﬁrm volatility.\nMoreover, a ﬁrm with rigged incentive pay that is one standard deviation above the\nmean faces a subsequent decrease of 4.8% in ﬁrm value and 7.5% in operating return\non assets.\nINCENTIVE CONTRACTS ARE generally thought to be one of the cornerstones of\ncorporate governance available to a board to align managers’ interests with\nthose of shareholders (e.g., Holmstrom (1979)).

In this paper, we cast a neg-\native light on the extent to which incentive contracting can counter agency\nproblems and substitute for good governance arrangements. We argue that,\nwhen a board is relatively weak, incentive contracting may itself become a\nsource of shareholder value leakage.

Although the relative returns of alternative S&P 500 funds are\neasily predictable, the relationship between cash flows and performance is weaker\nthan rational behavior would lead us to expect.

Here, the Monty Hall\nproblem is used to detect probability judgment errors both in a cohort of individuals\nand in a market setting.

However, competition among two bias-\nfree subjects was sufficient to drive prices to error-free levels. Thus, heterogeneity\nin behavior can be an important factor in asset pricing, and further, it may take few\nbias-free traders to make asset prices bias-free.\nIN RECENT YEARS, behavioral researchers have challenged the joint hypotheses of\nefficient markets and the idea that average (excess) returns are solely rewards\nfor risk, suggesting that these are deficient for interpreting capital market data\n(De Bondt and Thaler (1985), Shleifer (2000), Hirshleifer (2001)).

    "abstract": "Previous empirical work on adverse consequences of CEO overconﬁdence raises the\nquestion of why ﬁrms hire overconﬁdent managers. Theoretical research suggests a\nreason: overconﬁdence can beneﬁt shareholders by increasing investment in risky\nprojects. Using options- and press-based proxies for CEO overconﬁdence, we ﬁnd\nthat over the 1993–2003 period, ﬁrms with overconﬁdent CEOs have greater return\nvolatility, invest more in innovation, obtain more patents and patent citations, and\nachieve greater innovative success for given research and development expenditures.\nHowever, overconﬁdent managers achieve greater innovation only in innovative in-\ndustries. Our ﬁndings suggest that overconﬁdence helps CEOs exploit innovative\ngrowth opportunities.\nSTEVE JOBS , FORMER CEO of Apple Computers, was ranked by Business-\nWeek as one of the greatest innovators of the last 75 years in a 2004\narticle—written before Apple’s introduction of the path-breaking iPhone and\niPad—because “More than anyone else, Apple’s co-founder has brought digital\ntechnology to the masses.” Jobs is almost as famous for his self-conﬁdence.\nAccording to the same article, “He got his ﬁrst job at 12 after calling Hewlett-\nPackard Co....

    "title": "Are Stocks Really Less Volatile in the Long Run?",
    "abstract": "According to conventional wisdom, annualized volatility of stock returns is lower over\nlong horizons than over short horizons, due to mean reversion induced by return pre-\ndictability. In contrast, we ﬁnd that stocks are substantially more volatile over long\nhorizons from an investor’s perspective. This perspective recognizes that parameters\nare uncertain, even with two centuries of data, and that observable predictors imper-\nfectly deliver the conditional expected return. Mean reversion contributes strongly\nto reducing long-horizon variance but is more than offset by various uncertainties\nfaced by the investor. The same uncertainties reduce desired stock allocations of\nlong-horizon investors contemplating target-date funds.\nCONVENTIONAL WISDOM VIEWS STOCKreturns as less volatile over longer invest-\nment horizons. This view seems consistent with various empirical estimates.\nFor example, using two centuries of U.S. equity returns,Siegel (2008)reports\nthat variances realized over investment horizons of several decades are sub-\nstantially lower than short-horizon variances on a per-year basis. Such evi-\ndence pertains to unconditional variance, but a similar message is delivered\nby studies that condition variance on information useful in predicting returns.\nCampbell and Viceira (2002, 2005), for example, report estimates of conditional\nvariances that decrease with the investment horizon.\nWe ﬁnd that stocks are actuallymore volatile over long horizons from an\ninvestor’s perspecti",

As a result, undeveloped land facilitates\nconstruction and intensiﬁes the speculation that causes booms and busts in house\nprices. This observation challenges the standard intuition that in cities where con-\nstruction is easier, house price booms are smaller. It can also explain why the largest\nhouse price booms in the United States between 2000 and 2006 occurred in areas\nwith elastic housing supply.\nASSET PRICES GO THROUGH PERIODS of sustained price increases, followed by\nbusts. To explain these episodes, economists have developed theories based on\ndisagreement, speculation, and strategic trading. This literature focuses on the\nbehavior of asset prices in stock markets.

These effects are concentrated\nin thin markets with few potential users and in areas with low access to ﬁnance.\nThese ﬁndings suggest that when search frictions are large, liquidation can lead to\ninefﬁcient allocation of assets in bankruptcy.\nDECLINING INDUSTRIES, INSOLVENCY, AND DISTRESSED ﬁrms are unavoidable con-\nsequences of an evolving economy.

A bubble arises as price overweighs op-\ntimists’ beliefs and investors anticipate the option to resell to those with even higher\nvaluations.

When we compare asset growth\nrates with the previously documented determinants of the cross-section of returns (i.e.,\nbook-to-market ratios, firm capitalization, lagged returns, accruals, and other growth\nmeasures), we find that a firm’s annual asset growth rate emerges as an economically\nand statistically significant predictor of the cross-section of U.S. stock returns.\nONE OF THE PRIMARY FUNCTIONS OF CAPITAL MARKETS is the efficient pricing of\nreal investment.

The results emphasize\nthat a general equilibrium analysis may reverse the conclusions of a partial equilib-\nrium analysis often employed in the literature.\nMARGIN DEBT IS WIDELY USEDin the ﬁnancial industry to build leveraged posi-\ntions. To protect themselves against losses caused by adverse price movements,\ncreditors impose margin requirements, which put an upper limit on borrow-\ners’ portfolio leverage. The tightness of margin constraints may be regulated\nlegislatively or determined by an agreement between the borrower and the\nlender. For instance, Regulation T of the Federal Reserve sets initial margin\nrequirements on equity investments, that is, it restricts the loan amount that\ninvestors can receive from brokers for purchasing stocks. Since January 1974,\nthe initial margin requirement has been 50%. In addition, brokerage ﬁrms\nusually impose further restrictions on how leveraged their customers can be\nby setting a minimum amount of equity that borrowers must maintain.\nThe tightness of margin r",

    "abstract": "A new measure of consumption, garbage, is more volatile and more correlated with\nstocks than the canonical measure, National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA)\nconsumption expenditure. A garbage-based consumption capital asset pricing model\nmatches the U.S. equity premium with relative risk aversion of 17 versus 81 and\nevades the joint equity premium-risk-free rate puzzle. These results carry through\nto European data. In a cross-section of size, value, and industry portfolios, garbage\ngrowth is priced and drives out NIPA expenditure growth.\nTHE TEXTBOOK STATEMENTof the equity premium puzzle is that under standard\nassumptions, given the observed low volatility of consumption, the average ex-\ncess return of stocks over bonds is too high (Mehra and Prescott (1985)). The\ntextbook response is to introduce new preferences (e.g., Epstein and Zin (1991)\nand Constantinides (1990)), posit incomplete markets (e.g., Constantinides and\nDufﬁe (1996)), or conjure rare disasters (e.g., Rietz (1988)). Similarly, the long-\nrun risk literature (e.g., Bansal and Yaron (2004)) relies on both nonstan-\ndard preferences and hard-to-detect low-frequency consumption volatility. But\na simple restatement of the puzzle hints at a more parsimonious solution: un-\nder standard assumptions, given the observed high equity premium, measured\nconsumption is too smooth. A new and distinct measure of consumption could\nshed light on the puzzle by addressing the key question: is the problem with\nthe model or with th",

The analysis suggests that a policy of discretionary disclosure that en-\ncourages managers to attract the market’s attention when the firm is substantially\nundervalued can create shareholder value. The theory also relates the credibility of\nmanagerial announcements to the use of stock-based compensation, the presence of\ninformed trading, and the liquidity of the stock.

Results indicate \nthat execution costs are higher in Paris than in New York after controlling for \ndifferences in adverse selection, relative tick size, and economic attributes across \nsamples.

When Treasury securities go “off the run” their\ntrading volume drops by more than 90%.

In the\nthree years following a $0.88 minimum wage increase, low-wage workers experience a\n$2,712 income increase and a $856 decrease in debt. The entire decline in debt comes\nfrom less student loan borrowing among enrolled college students. Credit constraints,\nbuffer-stock behavior, and other rational channels cannot explain the reduction in\nstudent debt. Our results are consistent with students perceiving a utility cost of\nborrowing student debt arising from mental accounting.\nHOW DO WAGE GAINS AFFECT the borrowing and debt decisions of low-wage\nworkers? In particular, do wage gains inﬂuence how low-wage workers ﬁnance\nhuman capital investments, such as enrollment in higher education? The an-\nswers to these questions are of ﬁrst-order economic importance for at least\ntwo reasons. First, a large number of college students in the United States\nwork low-wage jobs while attending school (Dinkes et al. (2008)). Given that\nthese individuals also ﬁnance a signiﬁcant portion of their education-related\nexpenses with student loans (Darolia (2017)), a better understanding of how\nlow-wage individuals respond to wage gains could have important implications\nfor the aggregate growth rate of student loan debt.

First, once one moves past the very smallest stocks, the \nprofitability of momentum strategies declines sharply with firm size. Second, hold- \ning size fixed, momentum strategies work better among stocks with low analyst \ncoverage. Finally, the effect of analyst coverage is greater for stocks that are past \nlosers than for past winners. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis \nthat firm-specific information, especially negative information, diffuses only grad- \nually across the investing public. \nSEVERAL RECENT PAPERS HAVE DOCUMENTED that, at medium-term horizons rang- \ning from three to 12 months, stock returns exhibit momentum-that is, past \nwinners continue to perform well, and past losers continue to perform poorly. \nFor example, Jegadeesh and Titman (1993), using a U.S. sample of NYSE/ \nAMEX stocks over the period from 1965 to 1989, find that a strategy that \nbuys past six-month winners (stocks in the top performance decile) and shorts \npast six-month losers (stocks in the bottom performance decile) earns ap- \nproximately one percent per month over the subsequent six months.

To avoid stigma, high-\nquality ﬁrms withdraw from subsequent ﬁnancing after receiving bailouts or refuse\nbailouts altogether to send a favorable signal. The former leads to a short-lived stim-\nulation followed by a market freeze even worse than if there were no bailout. The\nlatter revives the funding market, albeit with delay , to the level achievable with-\nout any stigma and implements a constrained optimal outcome.

To identify this relationship, I study the effect on firms’ fi-\nnancial structures of two changes in bank funding constraints: the 1961 emergence of\nthe market for certificates of deposit, and the 1966 Credit Crunch. Following an expan-\nsion (contraction) in the availability of bank loans, leverage ratios of bank-dependent\nfirms significantly increase (decrease) relative to firms with bond market access.

We refer to such entities as\n“global” banks.\nThis changing orientation in banking activity raises important questions\nabout how banks manage their liquidity, how they react to liquidity shocks,\nand how these shocks may be transmitted across borders. We conjecture that\nglobal banks can respond to a domestic liquidity shock by activating a cross-\nborder, internal capital market between the head ofﬁce and its foreign ofﬁces,\nthus reallocating funds on the basis of relative needs. Because of this potential\naccess to internal capital markets with foreign ofﬁces, lending by global banks\nis likely to be more insul",

Little \nis known, however, about the role played by the market structure of the banking \nsector on the dynamics of capital accumulation. This paper provides evidence that \nbank concentration promotes the growth of those industrial sectors that are more \nin need of external finance by facilitating credit access to younger firms. However, \nwe also find evidence of a general depressing effect on growth associated with a \nconcentrated banking industry, which impacts all sectors and all firms \nindiscriminately. \nTHE IMPORTANCE OF FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT for economic growth has been ex- \ntensively analyzed in recent years. The amount of credit that the banking \nsector makes available for productive uses is one of the most significant \nmeasures of financial development. Such an indicator of size of the banking \nsector has been shown to have a significant, positive effect on growth. In \nthis paper, we study whether, for a given size, the market structure of the \nbanking sector has empirical relevance for economic growth. If it is agreed \nth",

    "abstract": "We show that maturity transformation does not expose banks to interest rate risk—\nit hedges it. The reason is the deposit franchise, which allows banks to pay deposit\nrates that are low and insensitive to market interest rates. Hedging the deposit fran-\nchise requires banks to earn income that is also insensitive, that is, to lend long term\nat ﬁxed rates. As predicted by this theory, we show that banks closely match the\ninterest rate sensitivities of their interest income and expense, and that this insu-\nlates their equity from interest rate shocks. Our results explain why banks supply\nlong-term credit.\nA DEFINING FUNCTION OF BANKS is maturity transformation—borrowing\nshort term and lending long term. This function is important because it sup-\nplies ﬁrms with long-term credit and households with short-term liquid de-\nposits.

    "abstract": "What ties together the traditional commercial banking activities of deposit- \ntaking and lending? We argue that since banks often lend via commitments, \ntheir lending and deposit-taking may be two manifestations of one primitive func- \ntion: the provision of liquidity on demand. There will be synergies between the \ntwo activities to the extent that both require banks to hold large balances of \nliquid assets: If deposit withdrawals and commitment takedowns are imperfectly \ncorrelated, the two activities can share the costs of the liquid-asset stockpile. We \ndevelop this idea with a simple model, and use a variety of data to test the model \nempirically. \nWHAT ARE THE DEFINING CHARACTERISTICS of a bank? Both the legal definition in \nthe United States and the standard answer from economists is that com- \nmercial banks are institutions that engage in two distinct types of activities, \none on each side of the balance sheet-deposit-taking and lending. More \nprecisely, deposit-taking involves issuing claims that are riskless and de- \nmandable, that is, claims that can be redeemed for a fixed value at any time. \nLending involves acquiring costly information about opaque borrowers, and \nextending credit based on this information. \nA great deal of theoretical and empirical analysis has been devoted to \nunderstanding the circumstances under which each of these two activities \nmight require the services of an intermediary, as opposed to being imple- \nmented in arm's-length securities mark",

To address this question, I study a model in which the venture capitalist\ncan evaluate the entrepreneur’s project more accurately than the bank but can also\nthreaten to steal it from the entrepreneur. Consistent with evidence regarding venture\ncapital finance, the model implies that the characteristics of a firm financing through\nventure capitalists are relatively little collateral, high growth, high risk, and high\nprofitability. The model also suggests that tighter protection of intellectual property\nrights encourages entrepreneurs to finance through venture capitalists.\nSINCE 1980 THE U.S. VENTURE capital industry has grown dramatically. Venture\ncapitalists are known to play a crucial role in incubating new firms by sup-\nplying them with equity capital. Banks, too, are an important source of funds\nfor new firms.

First, we analyze\nbidding behavior under different auction formats, showing that the second-price auc-\ntion induces higher prices, higher bankruptcy rates, and lower utilities than the first-\nprice auction. Second, we show that the cost of bankruptcy critically affects the seller’s\npreference over the choice of auction. If bankruptcy is very costly, the seller prefers the\nfirst-price auction over the second-price auction. Alternatively, if the bankrupt assets\nare resold among the losers of the initial auction, the seller prefers the second-price\nauction.\nAUCTIONS ARE BECOMING AN EVER MORE POPULAR way to allocate important, large-\nscale property rights. A major concern in such large auctions is that agents may\nbid aggressively, anticipating that they can declare bankruptcy if the good is\nworth less than expected.

Exploiting the cross-state, cross-time variation in the timing of branch\nderegulation, we ﬁnd that deregulation materially tightened the distribution of in-\ncome by boosting incomes in the lower part of the income distribution while having\nlittle impact on incomes above the median. Bank deregulation tightened the distribu-\ntion of income by increasing the relative wage rates and working hours of unskilled\nworkers.\nINCOME DISTRIBUTIONAL CONSIDERATIONS have played a central—if not the\ncentral—role in shaping the policies that govern ﬁnancial markets.

    "abstract": "Private equity funds pay particular attention to capital structure when executing\nleveraged buyouts, creating an interesting setting for examining capital structure\ntheories. Using a large, international sample of buyouts from 1980 to 2008, we ﬁnd\nthat buyout leverage is unrelated to the cross-sectional factors, suggested by tradi-\ntional capital structure theories, that drive public ﬁrm leverage. Instead, variation\nin economy-wide credit conditions is the main determinant of leverage in buyouts.\nHigher deal leverage is associated with higher transaction prices and lower buyout\nfund returns, suggesting that acquirers overpay when access to credit is easier.\n“We buy stuff with cheap debt and arbitrage on the difference with equity\nmarkets.” (Guy Hands, founding partner of the private equity ﬁrm Terra\nFirma, Financial Times, November 15, 2007)\nPRIVATE EQUITY INVESTORS are expert, repeat, and largely ﬁnancially moti-\nvated players in capital markets.

    "abstract": "This paper studies optimal contracts when managers manipulate their performance\nmeasure at the expense of ﬁrm value. Optimal contracts defer compensation. The\nmanager’s incentives vest over time at an increasing rate, and compensation becomes\nvery sensitive to short-term performance. This generates an endogenous horizon prob-\nlem whereby managers intensify performance manipulation in their ﬁnal years in of-\nﬁce. Contracts are designed to encourage effort while minimizing the adverse effects\nof manipulation. We characterize the optimal mix of short- and long-term compensa-\ntion along the manager’s tenure, the optimal vesting period of incentive pay, and the\ndynamics of short-termism over the CEO’s tenure.\nSHORT-TERMISM IS PREVALENT AMONG MANAGERS. Graham, Harvey, and Rajgopal\n(2005) ﬁnd that 78% of U.S. CEOs are willing to sacriﬁce long-term value\nto beat market expectations. For example, Dechow and Sloan (1991) argue\nthat, by the end of their tenure, CEOs tend to cut R&D investment, which,\nthough proﬁtable, has negative implications for the ﬁrm’s reported earnings.\nManagerial short-termism has been the suspect of concern for many years,\nbut it has assumed a particularly prominent role in recent years following the\nEnron scandal and the ﬁnancial crisis in 2008.\nTo understand this phenomenon, the theoretical literature has adopted two\napproaches. One approach studies CEO behavior, taking managerial incentives\nas given, and thus is silent about optimal incentives (see, e.g., Ste",

    "abstract": "Weargue that managerial overconfidence can account for corporate investment distor-\ntions. Overconfident managers overestimate the returns to their investment projects\nand view external funds as unduly costly. Thus, they overinvest when they have abun-\ndant internal funds, but curtail investment when they require external financing. We\ntest the overconfidence hypothesis, using panel data on personal portfolio and corpo-\nrate investment decisions of Forbes 500 CEOs. We classify CEOs as overconfident if\nthey persistently fail to reduce their personal exposure to company-specific risk. We\nfind that investment of overconfident CEOs is significantly more responsive to cash\nflow, particularly in equity-dependent firms.\nIN THIS PAPER , WE ARGUE THAT PERSONAL characteristics of CEOs in large corpo-\nrations lead to distortions in corporate investment policies. In particular, we\nstudy the investment decisions of CEOs who overestimate the future returns of\ntheir companies, measured by a failure to divest company-specific risk on their\npersonal accounts. We find that overconfident CEOs have a heightened sensitiv-\nity of corporate investment to cash flow, particularly among equity-dependent\nfirms.\nThe two traditional explanations for investment distortions are the misalign-\nment of managerial and shareholders interests (Jensen and Meckling (1976);\nJensen (1986)) and asymmetric information between corporate insiders and the\ncapital market (Myers and Majluf (1984)).

The likelihood of receiving\na successful takeover bid is sharply higher when target CEOs are close to age 65.\nTakeover premiums and target announcement returns are similar for retirement-age\nand younger CEOs, implying that retirement-age CEOs increase ﬁrm sales without\nsacriﬁcing premiums. Better corporate governance is associated with more acquisi-\ntions of ﬁrms led by young CEOs, and with a smaller increase in deals at retirement\nage.\nFROM 1990 TO 2012, CLOSE TO 9,700 public U.S. ﬁrms were acquired.

A\nsignificant inverse relation exists between bidder returns and the likelihood of CEO\nturnover. This relation is not associated with governance structure.

Angel, Harris, and Spatt argue that such routing may not always\nbe in customers’ best interests. For both proprietary limit order data and a broad\nsample of trades from TAQ, we document a negative relation between several mea-\nsures of limit order execution quality and rebate/fee level. This ﬁnding suggests that\norder routing designed to maximize liquidity rebates does not maximize limit order\nexecution quality and thus brokers cannot have it all.\nTODAY, EVERY U.S. STOCK exchange levies fees or pays rebates that depend\non an order’s attributes. In the standard model, exchanges charge liquidity-\ndemanding orders (i.e., marketable orders) a “take fee” that exceeds the “make\nrebate” they offer liquidity-supplying orders (i.e., nonmarketable limit orders).\nMore recently, a few exchanges began using inverted fee schedules, charging\nliquidity suppliers a fee that exceeds the rebate they pay to liquidity deman-\nders.1 In this paper, we examine the impact of these differential fee schedules\non broker routing decisions and limit order execution quality.\n∗Battalio and Corwin are with the Mendoza College of Business at the University of Notre\nDame.

    "abstract": "For years, online retailers have maintained a price advantage over brick-and-mortar\nretailers by not collecting sales tax at the time of sale. Recently, several states\nhave required that online retailer Amazon collect sales tax during checkout. Using\ntransaction-level data, we document that households living in these states reduced\ntheir Amazon purchases by 9.4% following the implementation of the sales tax laws,\nimplying elasticities of –1.2 to –1.4. The effect is stronger for large purchases, where\npurchases declined by 29.1%, corresponding to an elasticity of –3.9. Studying competi-\ntors in the electronics ﬁeld, we ﬁnd some evidence of substitution toward competing\nretailers.\nOVER THE PAST DECADE , ONLINE RETAIL transactions have increased dramatically\nin volume. According to the U.S. Census, online sales constituted 3.4% of retail\nsales in 2007 and 8.9% of retail sales in 2017, corresponding to $453 billion in\nonline sales in 2017. 1 Many factors have contributed to the growth in online\nsales, one of which is that out-of-state online retailers generally do not charge\nsales tax, which has given them a price advantage over retailers with a pres-\nence in the state. This sales tax collection loophole has not gone unnoticed by\nstate governments or competing retailers.

    "abstract": "Why is the equity premium so high, and why are stocks so volatile? Why are stock\nreturns in excess of government bill rates predictable? This paper proposes an answer\nto these questions based on a time-varying probability of a consumption disaster. In\nthe model, aggregate consumption follows a normal distribution with low volatility\nmost of the time, but with some probability of a consumption realization far out in\nthe left tail. The possibility of this poor outcome substantially increases the equity\npremium, while time-variation in the probability of this outcome drives high stock\nmarket volatility and excess return predictability.\nTHE MAGNITUDE OF THEexpected excess return on stocks relative to bonds (the\nequity premium) constitutes one of the major puzzles in ﬁnancial economics. As\nMehra and Prescott (1985) show, the ﬂuctuations observed in the consumption\ngrowth rate over U.S. history predict an equity premium that is far too small,\nassuming reasonable levels of risk aversion.1 One proposed explanation is that\nthe return on equities is high to compensate investors for the risk of a rare\ndisaster (Rietz (1988)). An open question has therefore been whether the risk\nis sufﬁciently high, and the rare disaster sufﬁciently severe, to quantitatively\nexplain the equity premium.

    "abstract": "We investigate the relation between global foreign exchange (FX) volatility risk and\nthe cross section of excess returns arising from popular strategies that borrow in\nlow interest rate currencies and invest in high interest rate currencies, so-called\n“carry trades.” We ﬁnd that high interest rate currencies are negatively related to\ninnovations in global FX volatility, and thus deliver low returns in times of unexpected\nhigh volatility, when low interest rate currencies provide a hedge by yielding positive\nreturns. Furthermore, we show that volatility risk dominates liquidity risk and our\nvolatility risk proxy also performs well for pricing returns of other portfolios.\nTHIS PAPER STUDIES THE risk-return proﬁle of a popular trading strategy that\nborrows in currencies with low interest rates and invests in currencies with\nhigh interest rates.

    "abstract": "We develop a new approach to modeling dynamics in cash ﬂows extracted from daily\nﬁrm-level dividend announcements. We decompose daily cash ﬂow news into a persis-\ntent component, jumps, and temporary shocks. Empirically, we ﬁnd that the persistent\ncash ﬂow component is a highly signiﬁcant predictor of future growth in dividends\nand consumption. Using a log-linearized present value model, we show that news\nabout the persistent dividend growth component predicts stock returns consistent\nwith asset pricing constraints implied by this model.

    "abstract": "I link an asset’s risk premium to two characteristics of its underlying cash flow: covari-\nance and duration. Using empirically novel estimates of both cash flow characteristics\nbased exclusively on accounting earnings and aggregate consumption data, I examine\ntheir dynamic interaction in a two-factor cash flow model and find that they are able\nto explain up to 82% of the cross-sectional variation in the average returns on size,\nbook-to-market, and long-term reversal-sorted portfolios for the period 1964 to 2002.\nThis finding highlights the importance of fundamental cash flow characteristics in\ndetermining the risk exposure of an asset.\nDIFFERENCES IN EXPECTED RETURN ACROSS assets are determined by differences in\nthe assets’ exposure to systematic risk. This key insight in financial economics\nis reflected in the standard consumption-based asset pricing model (CCAPM,\nsee Rubinstein (1976), Lucas (1978), and Breeden (1979)). CCAPM predicts that\nan asset’s consumption beta—a measure of the comovement between asset re-\nturn and aggregate consumption—determines its expected return. Yet despite\nits intuitive appeal, many early empirical tests have not supported this pre-\ndiction (see Breeden, Gibbons, and Litzenberger (1989)). Beginning with the\nseminal work of Bansal and Yaron (2004), advances in our understanding of\n“long-run” consumption risk may validate this theoretical position after all.\nIndeed, papers such as Parker and Julliard (2005), Bansal, Dittmar, and Lund-\nblad (2005",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the relation between corporate liquidity and diversiﬁcation. The\nkey ﬁnding is that multidivision ﬁrms hold signiﬁcantly less cash than stand-alone\nﬁrms because they are diversiﬁed in their investment opportunities. Lower cross-\ndivisional correlations in investment opportunity and higher correlations between\ninvestment opportunity and cash ﬂow correspond to lower cash holdings, even after\ncontrolling for cash ﬂow volatility. The effects are strongest in ﬁnancially constrained\nﬁrms and in well-governed ﬁrms, and correspond to efﬁcient fund transfers from low-\nto high-productivity divisions. Taken together, these results bring forth an efﬁcient\nlink between diversiﬁcation and corporate liquidity.\nCASH HOLDINGS OF U.S. companies are enormous and growing over time. As of\nﬁscal year 2006, nonﬁnancial and nonutility ﬁrms in the Compustat universe\nreported aggregate cash holdings of over 1.7 trillion dollars, representing 9.2%\nof the total market value of these ﬁrms’ equity.1 The growth in cash holdings\nis equally impressive. According to Bates, Kahle, and Stulz (2009, BKS hence-\nforth), listed U.S. industrial ﬁrms’ average ratio of cash to assets increased from\n10.5% in 1980 to 23.2% in 2006. This massive increase in cash has captured\nthe attention of both academics and the media.

However, recent studies report con-\ntradictory evidence. I focus on the takeover-deterrence effects of corporate liquidity\nand suggest the proxy contest as an effective alternative control mechanism. I find\nthat proxy fight targets hold 23% more cash than comparable firms, and that the\nprobability of a contest is significantly increasing in excess cash holdings. Proxy fight\nannouncement return also is positively related to excess cash. Following a contest, ex-\necutive turnover and special cash distributions to shareholders increase, while cash\nholdings significantly decline.\nQUITE OFTEN, THE TAKEOVER MARKET is suggested as ideal for containing the agency\nproblems of corporate free cash flow. Contrary to this, however, Harford (1999)\nand Pinkowitz (2002) both find that the likelihood of a firm becoming a takeover\ntarget is significantly negatively related to the holding of excess cash. This\nresult could be explained in terms of the takeover-deterrence effects of corporate\nliquidity. Excess cash enhances the ability of a hostile target to defend itself\nagainst an unwanted bid.

The theory predicts\nthat when investors place higher valuations on low-price firms, managers respond by\nsupplying shares at lower price levels, and vice versa. We confirm these predictions\nin time-series and firm-level data using several measures of time-varying catering\nincentives. More generally, the results provide unusually clean evidence that catering\ninfluences corporate decisions, because the process of targeting nominal share prices\nis not well explained by alternative theories.\nIN FRICTIONLESS AND EFFICIENT stock markets, there is no optimal nominal (per-\nshare) stock price. A firm’s board of directors may choose to split to manage\nthe nominal share price and number of shares outstanding but cannot change\nits overall market value through these means.

Active value funds better hedge\ndownside risk, while active growth funds better capture upside potential. Since such\nperformance features may appeal to investors with tail-overweighting preferences,\nwe show that preferences for downside protection and upside potential estimated\nfrom the empirical pricing kernel can help explain active fund ﬂows in the value\nand growth categories, respectively. This effect of investor risk preferences varies sig-\nniﬁcantly with funds’ downside-hedging and upside-capturing ability, with levels of\nactive management, and across retirement and retail funds.\nDESPITE THE MEDIOCRE PERFORMANCE of actively managed mutual funds rela-\ntive to their passively managed counterparts, assets under active management\ncontinue to signiﬁcantly outweigh those of index funds.1 This puzzle has at-\ntracted considerable interest in the mutual fund literature.

We find that the year after a fund changes\nits name to reflect a current hot style, the fund experiences an average cumulative\nabnormal flow of 28%, with no improvement in performance. The increase in flows is\nsimilar across funds whose holdings match the style implied by their new name and\nthose whose holdings do not, suggesting that investors are irrationally influenced by\ncosmetic effects.\nMUTUAL FUNDS OFFER A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY to study the behavior of individual\ninvestors via the examination of mutual fund flow data.

Results indicate that risk arbitrage returns are positively\ncorrelated with market returns in severely depreciating markets but uncorrelated\nwith market returns in flat and appreciating markets. This suggests that returns\nto risk arbitrage are similar to those obtained from selling uncovered index put\noptions. Using a contingent claims analysis that controls for the nonlinear rela-\ntionship with market returns, and after controlling for transaction costs, we find\nthat risk arbitrage generates excess returns of four percent per year.\nAFTER THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF A MERGER or acquisition, the target company’s\nstock typically trades at a discount to the price offered by the acquiring\ncompany. The difference between the target’s stock price and the offer price\nis known as the arbitrage spread. Risk arbitrage, also called merger arbi-\ntrage, refers to an investment strategy that attempts to profit from this\nspread.

    "abstract": "We test the asset pricing implications of collateralized borrowing (that is, of using\nassets as collateral to borrow money) in the laboratory. To this purpose, we develop\na general equilibrium model with collateral constraints amenable to laboratory im-\nplementation and gather experimental data. In the laboratory, assets that can be\nleveraged fetch higher prices than assets that cannot, even though assets’ payoffs are\nidentical in all states of the world. Collateral value, therefore, creates deviations from\nthe Law of One Price. The spread between collateralizeable and noncollateralizeable\nassets is signiﬁcant and quantitatively close to theoretical predictions.\nTHE 2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS HIGHLIGHTED THE limited understanding of the role\nof leverage in ﬁnancial markets among both academics and practitioners. 1As\na result, in the years following the crisis, a strand of the theoretical ﬁnan-\ncial literature focused on the impact of leverage on asset prices. 2 During the\ncrisis, it also became apparent that cross-sectional differences in asset prices\nwere related to heterogeneity in asset collateral capacities. Several theoret-\nical papers study the cross-sectional implications of collateralized borrowing\nin a world where agents are heterogeneous and markets are incomplete: for\ninstance, Fostel and Geanakoplos ( 2008) in a collateral general equilibrium\nmodel, Garleanu and Pedersen ( 2011) in a CAPM model, and Brumm et al.\n∗Marco Cipriani is at Federal Reserve Bank of New York, A",

    "abstract": "We show that institutions that promote ﬁnancial development ease borrowing con-\nstraints by lowering the collateral spread and shifting the composition of acceptable\ncollateral towards ﬁrm-speciﬁc assets. Collateral spread is deﬁned as the difference\nin collateralization rates between high- and low-risk borrowers. The average collat-\neral spread is large but declines rapidly with improvements in ﬁnancial development\ndriven by stronger institutions. We also show that the composition of collateralizable\nassets shifts towards non-speciﬁc assets (e.g., land) with borrower risk. However, the\nshift is considerably smaller in developed ﬁnancial markets, enabling risky borrowers\nto use a larger variety of assets as collateral.\nTHE DEMAND FOR COLLATERALIZABLE ASSETS is the fundamental cost of ﬁnancing\nin many models of ﬁnancial constraints (e.g., Bernanke and Gertler (1989),\nKiyotaki and Moore (1997), and Banerjee and Newman (1993) among others).\nMost theoretical models postulate that the availability of collateral is a binding\nconstraint on ﬁnancing, and that this constraint binds harder in more under-\ndeveloped ﬁnancial markets. However, despite this theoretical emphasis, not\nmuch is known about the effect of ﬁnancial development on the collateral cost\nof capital.

Options listed on multiple exchanges \nhave narrower spreads than those listed on a single exchange, but the difference \ndiminishes as option volume increases. Option spreads become wider when a com- \npeting exchange delists the option.

Systematic skewness is economically important and commands a risk \npremium, on average, of 3.60 percent per year. Our results suggest that the mo- \nmentum effect is related to systematic skewness.

The results challenge arguments that cash auctions, as compared \nto reorganizations, are immune to conflicts of interest between claimholders but \nlead to inefficient liquidations. I show that a sale of the assets back to incumbent \nmanagement is a common bankruptcy outcome. Sale-backs are more likely when \nthey favor the bank at the expense of other creditors. On the other hand, ineffi- \ncient liquidations are frequently avoided through sale-backs when markets are \nilliquid, that is, when industry indebtedness is high and the firm has few nonspe- \ncific assets. \nTHE PROBLEM OF DESIGNING an efficient bankruptcy law has received consid- \nerable attention in the last decade. Much of the debate has centered around \nthe optimality of two different stylized bankruptcy procedures: cash auc- \ntions, such as the U.S. Chapter 7 code, and structured bargaining, repre- \nsented by the U.S. Chapter 11 reorganization code.

While os-\ntensibly consistent with widespread “ruthless default,” analysis of detailed mortgage\nand house price data indicates that borrowers do not walk away until they are deeply\nunderwater—far deeper than traditional models predict. The evidence suggests that\nlender recourse is not the major driver of this result. We argue that emotional and\nbehavioral factors play an important role in decisions to continue paying. Borrower\nreluctance to walk away implies that the moral hazard cost of default as a form of\nsocial insurance may be lower than suspected.\nFROM 2007 TO 2009 HOUSE PRICES in the United States plunged, especially in\nmany areas of Arizona, California, Florida, and Nevada (Figure 1). At roughly\nthe same time, mortgage defaults surged, consistent with the predictions of\noption-theoretic models of mortgage pricing where borrowers “ruthlessly” de-\nfault to maximize their wealth (Foster and Van Order ( 1984, 1985)). Numerous\nmedia anecdotes suggest that ruthless defaults were widespread, and the pre-\nsumed wave of such defaults has led economists and policy makers to propose\nways to address ruthless or strategic defaulters.

The dynamics of aggregate consumption and cash flow growth rates,\nmodeled as a vector autoregression, are used to measure the consumption beta of\ndiscounted cash flows. Differences in these cash flow betas account for more than\n60% of the cross-sectional variation in risk premia. The market price for risk in cash\nflows is highly significant. We argue that cash flow risk is important for interpreting\ndifferences in risk compensation across assets.\nTHE IDEA THAT DIFFERENCES IN EXPOSURE to systematic risk should justify differ-\nences in risk premia across assets is central to asset pricing. The static CAPM\n(capital asset-pricing model) (see Sharpe (1964) and Lintner (1965)) implies\nthat assets’ exposures to aggregate wealth should determine cross-sectional\ndifferences in risk premia. The work of Lucas (1978) and Breeden (1979) ar-\ngues that the risk premium on an asset is determined by its ability to insure\nagainst consumption fluctuations. Hence, the exposure of asset returns to move-\nments in aggregate consumption (i.e., the consumption betas) should determine\ncross-sectional differences in risk premia. Evidence presented in Hansen and\nSingleton (1982) for the consumption-based models, and in Fama and French\n(1992) for the CAPM, shows that these models have considerable difficulty in\njustifying the",

    "abstract": "Financial contagion is described as a wealth effect in a continuous-time model with \ntwo risky assets and three types of traders. Noise traders trade randomly in one \nmarket. Long-term investors provide liquidity using a linear rule based on funda- \nmentals. Convergence traders with logarithmic utility trade optimally in both mar- \nkets. Asset price dynamics are endogenously determined (numerically) as functions \nof endogenous wealth and exogenous noise. When convergence traders lose money, \nthey liquidate positions in both markets. This creates contagion, in that returns \nbecome more volatile and more correlated. Contagion reduces benefits from port- \nfolio diversification and raises issues for risk management. \nDURING THE FINANCIAL PANIC ASSOCIATED with the default of the Russian govern- \nment in August 1998 and the subsequent collapse of the hedge fund Long Term \nCapital Management, numerous hedge funds, banks, and securities firms tried \nsimultaneously to reduce exposures to a variety of financial instruments, such \nas Russian bonds, Brazilian stocks, U.S. mortgages, spreads between on-the- \nrun and off-the-run government securities, and spreads between swaps and U.S. \nTreasuries.

    "abstract": "I survey and assess the development of continuous-time methods in finance during \nthe last 30 years. The subperiod 1969 to 1980 saw a dizzying pace of development \nwith seminal ideas in derivatives securities pricing, term structure theory, asset \npricing, and optimal consumption and portfolio choices. During the period 1981 to \n1999 the theory has been extended and modified to better explain empirical reg- \nularities in various subfields of finance. This latter subperiod has seen significant \nprogress in econometric theory, computational and estimation methods to test and \nimplement continuous-time models. Capital market frictions and bargaining is- \nsues are being increasingly incorporated in continuous-time theory. \nTHE ROOTS OF MODERN CONTINUOUS-TIME METHODS in finance can be traced back to \nthe seminal contributions of Merton (1969, 1971, 1973b) in the late 1960s and \nearly 1970s. Merton (1969) pioneered the use of continuous-time modeling in \nfinancial economics by formulating the intertemporal consumption and port- \nfolio choice problem of an investor in a stochastic dynamic programming set- \nting. Merton (1973b) also showed how such a framework can be used to develop \nequilibrium asset pricing implications, thereby significantly extending the as- \nset pricing theory to richer dynamic settings and expanding the scope of ap- \nplications of continuous-time methods to study problems in financial economics.' \nWithin a span of about 30 years from the publication of Merton's",

    "abstract": "If firms issue convertible securities to facilitate sequential investment, the securities\nshould be engineered to give sufficient flexibility to accommodate timing of follow-on\ninvestment. We examine call provisions in convertible bonds and argue that firms\nwith investment options expected to expire sooner (later) will offer weaker (stronger)\ncall protection. We find that issues with weak or no call protection are offered by\nfirms that invest greater amounts soon after issuance than those issuing convertibles\nwith strong protection. Moreover, capital expenditure levels during the 5-year period\nfollowing issuance are inversely related to the length of call-protection periods.\nMOST CONVERTIBLE BONDS AND NOTES have call provisions, and most provisions\nhave important qualifications or protection. Broadly speaking, convertibles may\nhave absolute protection (not callable), hard call protection (noncallable for a\nspecified period), provisional or soft call protection (callable if certain conditions\non stock price are met), or no protection (callable anytime).

In contrast, the\ndevelopment-control nexus is heterogeneous; strong for large but absent for small\nﬁrms. Control correlates strongly with shareholder protection, the stringency of\nemployment contracts and unions power. Conversely, the correlations with creditor\nrights, legal formalism, and entry regulation appear weak.

We explore this documented dis- \ncount and argue that it stems from risk-reducing effects of corporate diversifica- \ntion. Consistent with this risk-reduction hypothesis, we find that (a) shareholder \nlosses in diversification are a function of firm leverage, (b) all equity firms do not \nexhibit a diversification discount, and (c) using book values of debt to compute \nexcess value creates a downward bias for diversified firms.

In the model, ﬁrms face taxation,\nreﬁnancing costs, and liquidation costs. Managers own a fraction of the ﬁrms’ equity,\ncapture part of the free cash ﬂow to equity as private beneﬁts, and have control over\nﬁnancing decisions. Using data on leverage choices and the model’s predictions for\ndifferent statistical moments of leverage, we ﬁnd that agency costs of 1.5% of eq-\nuity value on average are sufﬁcient to resolve the low-leverage puzzle and to explain\nthe dynamics of leverage ratios. Our estimates also reveal that agency costs vary\nsigniﬁcantly across ﬁrms and correlate with commonly used proxies for corporate\ngovernance.\nA CENTRAL THEME IN ﬁnancial economics is that incentive conﬂicts within the\nﬁrm lead to distortions in corporate policy choices and to lower corporate perfor-\nmance.

We find that the announcement\nof these rules has a significant effect on firm value. Firms that are less compliant with\nthe provisions of the rules earn positive abnormal returns compared to firms that\nare more compliant. We also find variation in the response across firm size. Large\nfirms that are less compliant earn positive abnormal returns but small firms that are\nless compliant earn negative abnormal returns, suggesting that some provisions are\ndetrimental to small firms.\nTHE HIGH -PROFILE CORPORATE FAILURES IN THE UNITED STATES over the 2001–2002\nperiod have led to the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) and to various amend-\nments to the stock exchanges’ regulations. These rules include different provi-\nsions whose purpose is to ensure alignment of incentives of corporate insiders\nwith those of investors, and to reduce the likelihood of corporate misconduct and\nfraud. For example, SOX imposes higher penalties on officers who are charged\nwith forging documents and requires more timely disclosure of equity transac-\ntions by corporate insiders. It also requires independence of audit committees,\ncertification of financial statements by the chief executive officer and the chief\nfinancial officer, procedures to evaluate the effectiveness of the firms’ internal\ncontrols and increased oversight over audit firms.

    "abstract": "Better investor protection could lead corporations to undertake riskier but value-\nenhancing investments. For example, better investor protection mitigates the taking of\nprivate benefits leading to excess risk-avoidance. Further, in better investor protection\nenvironments, stakeholders like creditors, labor groups, and the government are less\neffective in reducing corporate risk-taking for their self-interest. However, arguments\ncan also be made for a negative relationship between investor protection and risk-\ntaking. Using a cross-country panel and a U.S.-only sample, we find that corporate\nrisk-taking and firm growth rates are positively related to the quality of investor\nprotection.\nA CENTRAL THEME OF CORPORATE governance studies is how constraints on cor-\nporate decision makers’ pursuit of self-interest lead to firm value-maximizing\nbehavior. In this paper we focus on how these mechanisms affect managerial\nrisk choices in corporate investment decisions and their consequent implica-\ntions for growth.\nBuilding on the seminal work of La Porta et al. (1997, 1998), recent finance\nresearch examines the importance of investor protection. One strand of the\nliterature focuses on the effect of investor protection on the cost of capital\n(e.g., Shleifer and Wolfenzon (2002), Lombardo and Pagano (2002), and Castro,\nClementi, and MacDonald (2004)). Poor investor protection creates the need for\ndominant owners (Burkart, Panunzi, and Shleifer (2003)). But, since the own-\ners cannot be tr",

    "abstract": "We study the relationship of corporate governance policy and idiosyncratic risk. Firms\nwith fewer antitakeover provisions display higher levels of idiosyncratic risk, trading\nactivity, private information flow, and information about future earnings in stock\nprices. Trading interest by institutions, especially those active in merger arbitrage,\nstrengthens the relationship of governance to idiosyncratic risk. Our results indicate\nthat openness to the market for corporate control leads to more informative stock\nprices by encouraging collection of and trading on private information.

    "abstract": "This paper extends the theory of non-cash auctions by considering the revenue and \nefficiency of using different securities. Research on bankruptcy and privatization \nsuggests using non-cash auctions to increase cash-constrained bidder participa- \ntion. We examine this proposal and demonstrate that securities may lead to higher \nrevenue. However, bidders pool unless bids include debt, which results in possible \nrepossession by the seller. This suggests all-equity outcomes are unlikely and ex- \nplains the high debt of reorganized firms. Securities also inefficiently determine \nbidders' incentive contracts and the firm's capital structure. Therefore, we recom- \nmend a new cash auction for an incentive contract. \nTwo IMPORTANT PAPERS in the legal literature, Baird (1986) and Jackson (1986), \nsuggest that a bankrupt firm's assets should be auctioned off. Their ratio- \nnale is that a cash auction is an efficient procedure for selling assets and the \nrole of bankruptcy procedures is not to reallocate claims but rather to allow \nfor efficient liquidation.1 \nSubsequently, in an influential paper, Aghion, Hart, and Moore (1992) \n(henceforth AHM) call for the replacement of the reorganization process (Chap- \nters 7 and 11 in the United States Bankruptcy Code) by a two-stage proce- \ndure that separates the valuation decision (price of the firm, who should \nmanage it, and with what capital structure) from the allocation decision for \nold claimants (which security gets what allocation).2 ",

Using a battery of liquidity\nmeasures covering over 4,000 corporate bonds and spanning both investment grade\nand speculative categories, we find that more illiquid bonds earn higher yield spreads,\nand an improvement in liquidity causes a significant reduction in yield spreads. These\nresults hold after controlling for common bond-specific, firm-specific, and macroeco-\nnomic variables, and are robust to issuers’ fixed effect and potential endogeneity bias.\nOur findings justify the concern in the default risk literature that neither the level\nnor the dynamic of yield spreads can be fully explained by default risk determinants.\nA NUMBER OF RECENT STUDIES (Collin-Dufresne, Goldstein, and Martin (2001) and\nHuang and Huang (2003)) indicate that neither levels nor changes in the yield\nspread of corporate bonds over Treasury bonds can be fully explained by credit\nrisk determinants proposed by structural form models.

    "abstract": "Using Swedish administrative panel data, we document that workers facing higher\nleft-tail income risk when equity markets perform poorly have lower portfolio equity\nshare. In line with theory, the relationship between cyclical skewness and stock hold-\nings increases with the share of human capital in a worker’s total wealth and van-\nishes as workers get closer to retirement. Cyclical skewness also predicts portfolio\ndifferences within pairs of identical twins. Our ﬁndings show that households hedge\nagainst correlated tail risks, an important mechanism in asset pricing and portfolio\nchoice models.\nHOW DOES FUTURE LABOR INCOME affect portfolios? One view is that human\ncapital increases the demand for equity because labor income risk is largely\nuncorrelated with stock returns (Viceira ( 2001), Cocco, Gomes, and Maenhout\n(2005)). However, this prediction is at odds with the reluctance of young work-\ners to buy stocks and makes it more difﬁcult to explain the equity premium.\nAn alternative view is that, although uncorrelated with stock returns, la-\nbor income risk is countercyclical, in particular, its skewness ﬂuctuates over\nthe business cycle.

    "abstract": "Motivated by recent financial crises in East Asia and the United States where the \ndownfall of a small number of firms had an economy-wide impact, this paper gen- \neralizes existing reduced-form models to include default intensities dependent on \nthe default of a counterparty. In this model, firms have correlated defaults due not \nonly to an exposure to common risk factors, but also to firm-specific risks that are \ntermed \"counterparty risks.\" Numerical examples illustrate the effect of counter- \nparty risk on the pricing of defaultable bonds and credit derivatives such as de- \nfault swaps. \nIT HAS BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED in Moody's reports on historical default rates of \ncorporate bond issuers that the number of defaults, the number of credit \nrating downgrades, and credit spreads are all strongly correlated with the \nbusiness cycle. This has motivated reduced-form models such as Duffie and \nSingleton (1999) and Lando (1994, 1998), which assume that the intensity of \ndefault is a stochastic process that derives its randomness from a set of state \nvariables such as the short-term interest rate. This approach has the con- \nvenient features that conditioning on the state variables, defaults become \nindependent events, and default correlation arises due to the common influ- \nence of these state variables. On the other hand, a default intensity that \ndepends linearly on a set of smoothly varying macroeconomic variables is \nunlikely to account for the clustering of defaults around an",

The data\nalso support additional implications of the model: the introduction of a currency union\nlowers interest rates in participating countries, and stocks in the nontraded sector of\nlarger economies pay lower expected returns.\nINTERNATIONAL INVESTORS EARN HIGH expected returns by borrowing in low in-\nterest rate currencies and lending in high interest rate currencies.

We find that bankruptcy announce-\nments cause negative abnormal equity returns and increases in CDS spreads for credi-\ntors. In addition, creditors with large exposures are more likely to suffer from financial\ndistress later. This suggests that counterparty risk is a potential additional channel\nof credit contagion.

Firms near a credit rating upgrade or downgrade\nissue less debt relative to equity than firms not near a change in rating.

We provide novel evidence that\nthese borrowers were more likely to inﬂate or exaggerate their income. Our analysis\nsuggests that recent regulatory changes that have essentially eliminated the low-doc\nloan product would result in credit rationing against self-employed borrowers.\nDURING THE GREAT RECESSION OF 2007 to 2008, the United States experienced\na massive increase in residential mortgage defaults and foreclosures not seen\nsince the Great Depression.

Results show that banks respond\nto poor enforceability of contracts by reducing loan amounts, shortening loan maturi-\nties, and increasing loan spreads. These effects are both statistically significant and\neconomically large. While stronger creditor rights reduce spreads, they do not seem\nto matter for loan size and maturity. Overall, we show that variation in enforceability\nof contracts matters a great deal more to how loans are structured and how they are\npriced.\nTHE EXTENT TO WHICH PROPERTY RIGHTS are protected in a country is an impor-\ntant consideration in determining what loans are offered to firms, how these\nloans are structured, and how they are priced.

    "abstract": "This paper documents clustering in currency stop-loss and take-profit orders, \nand uses that clustering to provide an explanation for two familiar predic- \ntions from technical analysis: (1) trends tend to reverse course at predictable \nsupport and resistance levels, and (2) trends tend to be unusually rapid after \nrates cross such levels. The data are the first available on individual currency \nstop-loss and take-profit orders. Take-profit orders cluster particularly \nstrongly at round numbers, which could explain the first prediction. Stop-loss \norders cluster strongly just beyond round numbers, which could explain the \nsecond prediction. \nEXCHANGE RATE RESEARCH HAS BROUGHT to light a robust but unexplained result: \nTechnical analysis is useful for predicting short-run exchange rate dynamics. \nThis is true for a wide variety of technical trading tools, including visual pat- \nterns, trend identification formulas, trend reversal signals, and genetic algo- \nrithms.1 The one potential explanation for this phenomenon familiar to \nexchange-rate economists- central bank intervention--does not survive rigor- \nous scrutiny (Neely (2000) and Osler (2002)). The ability of some technical meth- \nods to predict high-frequency exchange rate movements contrasts with the \npredictive difficulties of structural exchange-rate models.

    "abstract": "This paper examines how information becomes reflected in prices when in- \nvestment decisions are delegated to fund managers whose tenure may be \nshorter than the time it takes for their private information to become public. \nWe consider a sequence of managers, where each subsequent manager inherits \nthe portfolio of their predecessor. We show that the inherited portfolio distorts \nthe subsequent manager's incentive to trade on long-term information. This \nallows erroneous past information to persist, causing mispricing similar to a \nbubble. We investigate the magnitude of the mispricing. In addition, we exam- \nine endogenous information quality. In some cases, information quality in- \ncreases when the manager's expected tenure decreases. \nMORE THAN EVER BEFORE, investors delegate the management of their investment \nportfolios to professional fund managers.1 Due to mobility and turnover, the ex- \npected tenure of a manager may be shorter than the investment horizon of a typi- \ncal investor.2 Given this horizon mismatch, fund managers may have less \nincentive to collect and trade on long-term information than do the investors they \ntrade for. As a result, the prices in markets with more delegated investment will \nreflect less long-term information than those markets where long-lived investors \nmanage their own portfolios.

    "abstract": "Diamond and Dybvig (1983) show that while demand–deposit contracts let banks\nprovide liquidity, they expose them to panic-based bank runs. However, their model\ndoes not provide tools to derive the probability of the bank-run equilibrium, and\nthus cannot determine whether banks increase welfare overall. We study a modi-\nfied model in which the fundamentals determine which equilibrium occurs. This lets\nus compute the ex ante probability of panic-based bank runs and relate it to the con-\ntract. We find conditions under which banks increase welfare overall and construct a\ndemand–deposit contract that trades off the benefits from liquidity against the costs of\nruns.\nONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ROLES PERFORMED BY banks is the creation of liquid\nclaims on illiquid assets. This is often done by offering demand–deposit con-\ntracts. Such contracts give investors who might have early liquidity needs the\noption to withdraw their deposits, and thereby enable them to participate in\nprofitable long-term investments. Since each bank deals with many investors, it\ncan respond to their idiosyncratic liquidity shocks and thereby provide liquidity\ninsurance.\nThe advantage of demand–deposit contracts is accompanied by a considerable\ndrawback: The maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities makes banks\ninherently unstable by exposing them to the possibility of panic-based bank\nruns. Such runs occur when investors rush to withdraw their deposits, believing\nthat other depositors are going to do so",

We show that illiquid assets can\nhave lower expected returns if the short-sellers have more wealth, lower risk aversion,\nor shorter horizon. The pricing of liquidity risk is different for derivatives than for\npositive-net-supply assets, and depends on investors’ net nontraded risk exposure.\nWe estimate this model for the credit default swap market. We ﬁnd strong evidence\nfor an expected liquidity premium earned by the credit protection seller.

We present a number of theoretical predictions on the inter-\nactions between financial development, contracting costs, and the extent of vertical\nintegration. Consistent with these predictions, contracting costs and financial devel-\nopment by themselves appear to have no effect on vertical integration.

A number of explanations for the delay rely on the size of the dividends\nthat bondholders forgo so long as they do not convert. We investigate an important\nchange in convertible security design, namely, dividend protection of convertible bond\nissues. Dividend protection means that the conversion value of the convertible bond\nis unaffected by dividend payments and thus dividend-related rationales for call\ndelay become moot.

Using data for 1,301 publicly traded corporations in eight East Asian econ- \nomies, we find that firm value increases with the cash-flow ownership of the largest \nshareholder, consistent with a positive incentive effect. But firm value falls when \nthe control rights of the largest shareholder exceed its cash-flow ownership, con- \nsistent with an entrenchment effect. Given that concentrated corporate ownership \nis predominant in most countries, these findings have relevance for corporate gov- \nernance across the world. \nTHE EFFECTS OF OWNERSHIP STRUCTURES on the value of firms have been re- \nsearched extensively, with the role of large investors receiving special atten- \ntion. Investors with large ownership stakes have strong incentives to maximize \ntheir firms' value and are able to collect information and oversee managers, \nand so can help overcome one of the principal-agent problems in the modern \ncorporation-that of conflicts of interest between shareholders and man- \nagers (Jensen and Meckling (1976)).

    "abstract": "How far does mobility of multinational banks solve problems of financial develop-\nment? Using a panel of 80,000 loans over 7 years, I show that greater cultural and\ngeographical distance between a foreign bank’s headquarters and local branches leads\nit to further avoid lending to “informationally difficult” yet fundamentally sound firms\nrequiring relational contracting. Greater distance also makes them less likely to bi-\nlaterally renegotiate, and less successful at recovering defaults. Differences in bank\nsize, legal institutions, risk preferences, or unobserved borrower heterogeneity cannot\nexplain these results. These distance constraints can be large enough to permanently\nexclude certain sectors of the economy from financing by foreign banks.\n[w]hile the [foreign] banks easily provide funds to multinationals, and\neven large domestic firms, small and medium-size firms complained of a\nlack of access to capital.

    "abstract": "I use the Business Information Tracking Series (BITS), a new census database that\ncovers the whole U.S. economy at the establishment level, to examine whether the\nfinding of a diversification discount is an artifact of segment data. BITS data allow\nme to construct business units that are more consistently and objectively defined\nthan segments, and thus more comparable across firms. Using these data on a sample\nthat yields a discount according to segment data, I find a diversification premium. The\npremium is robust to variations in the sample, business unit definition, and measures\nof excess value and diversification.\nTHE DIVERSIFICATION DISCOUNT has been the subject of an active debate in cor-\nporate finance during the past few years. 1 On the one hand, Lang and Stulz\n(1994), Berger and Ofek (1995), and Servaes (1996) find that diversified firms\ntrade at an average discount relative to single-segment firms. This finding\nhas often been interpreted as evidence that diversification destroys value.\n2 On\nthe other hand, several studies show that the discount is only the product of\nsample selection biases. Villalonga (1999) and Campa and Kedia (2002) find\nthat diversified firms traded at a discount prior to diversifying.

I model such concerns by emphasizing the\ndesire to “get ahead of the Joneses,” which implies that aversion to idiosyncratic\nrisk is lower than aversion to aggregate risk. The model predicts that investors hold\nconcentrated portfolios in equilibrium, which helps rationalize the small premium for\nundiversiﬁed entrepreneurial risk. In the model, status concerns are more important\nfor wealthier households. Consequently, these households own a disproportionate\nshare of risky assets, particularly private equity, and experience greater volatility of\nconsumption, consistent with empirical evidence.\nDIVERSIFICATION AND RISK SHARINGare fundamental principles of modern ﬁnance\nand macroeconomics. However, empirical evidence suggests that household\nportfolios are poorly diversiﬁed, with many people reporting substantial hold-\nings of a single stock. For the wealthiest households large shares in closely held\nbusinesses constitute a particularly important source of risk (e.g., Heaton and\nLucas (2000a)).

    "title": "Do Banks Affect the Level and Composition of Industrial Volatility?",
    "abstract": "In theory, better access to bank credit can reduce or increase output volatility\ndepending on whether firms are more financially constrained during contractions or\nexpansions. This paper finds that the volatility of industrial output is lower in coun-\ntries with more bank credit. Most of the reduction in volatility is idiosyncratic, which\nfollows from the ability of banks to pool and diversify shocks. Systematic volatility is\nreduced less strongly. Volatility dampening is achieved via countercyclical borrowing:\nAt the firm level, short-term borrowing is less (or more negatively) correlated with\nsales and inventories in countries with high levels of bank credit.\nTHERE IS A DEBATE ABOUT THE EFFECT OF FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES —or financial\ndevelopment more generally—on the volatility of output. In theory, the effect\non volatility of having more financial intermediation is ambiguous, depending\non the stage of the country’s development (Aghion, Bacchetta, and Banerjee\n(2004)) or the type of shocks that affect the economy (e.g., real vs. monetary\nshocks as in Bacchetta and Caminal (2000), or credit demand versus credit\nsupply shocks as in Morgan, Rime, and Strahan (2004)). The existing empirical\nevidence is also inconclusive. For instance, while Acemoglu et al.

    "abstract": "We study the decision to choose bank debt rather than public securities in a firm's \nmarginal financing choice. Using a sample of 500 firms over the 1980 to 1993 time \nperiod, we find that firms are relatively more likely to choose bank loans when \nvariables that measure asymmetric information problems are elevated. The sen- \nsitivity of the likelihood of choosing bank debt to information problems is greater \nfor firms with no public debt outstanding. These results are consistent with the \nhypothesis that banks help alleviate asymmetric information problems and that \nfirms weigh these information benefits against a wide range of contracting costs \nwhen choosing bank financing. \nWHY DO SOME FIRMS BORROW from public sources while others rely exclusively \non private lenders? The answer to this question is not well understood. Ex- \nisting theories suggest that a firm must consider the tradeoff between the \nbenefits and costs of bank debt financing relative to other potential financ- \ning choices. The potential benefits of bank financing include low moral haz- \nard and adverse selection costs and ease of renegotiation in financial distress.1 \nThe potential costs of bank financing include monitoring costs, suboptimal \nliquidation outcomes, and distortions induced by information monopolies.2 \nThe goal of this paper is to identify whether adverse selection problems \ninfluence a firm's choice between new bank debt, public debt, or common \nstock.

How- \never, we find that, in practice, swap rates have limited explanatory power for \nreturns on at-the-money straddles-portfolios mainly exposed to volatility risk. \nWe term this empirical feature \"unspanned stochastic volatility\" (USV). While \nUSV can be captured within an HJM framework, we demonstrate that bivariate \nmodels cannot exhibit USV. We determine necessary and sufficient conditions for \ntrivariate Markov affine systems to exhibit USV. For such USV models, bonds \nalone may not be sufficient to identify all parameters.

    "abstract": "We examine how leveraged buyouts from the most recent wave of public to private\ntransactions created value. Buyouts completed between 1990 and 2006 are more con-\nservatively priced and less levered than their predecessors from the 1980s. For deals\nwith post-buyout data available, median market- and risk-adjusted returns to pre-\n(post-) buyout capital invested are 72.5% (40.9%). In contrast, gains in operating per-\nformance are either comparable to or slightly exceed those observed for benchmark\nﬁrms. Increases in industry valuation multiples and realized tax beneﬁts from in-\ncreasing leverage, while private, are each economically as important as operating\ngains in explaining realized returns.\nTHE LEVERAGED BUYOUT(LBO) wave of the 1980s was an important phenomenon\nwell studied by academics and practitioners.

We test whether these incentives affect the extent of corporate hedging \nwith derivatives. Using an explicit measure of tax function convexity, we find no \nevidence that firms hedge in response to tax convexity. Our analysis does, however, \nindicate that firms hedge to increase debt capacity, with increased tax benefits \naveraging 1.1 percent of firm value. Our results also indicate that firms hedge \nbecause of expected financial distress costs and firm size. \nAN INCREASING NUMBER OF CORPORATIONS use financial derivatives each year. \nThe International Swaps and Derivatives Association reports that the no- \ntional value of outstanding OTC swap contracts increased from $11.3 trillion \nin 1994 to more than $60 trillion by mid-2000 (http://www.isda.org). This is \ninteresting because financial theory tells us that corporate risk manage- \nment enhances value only in the presence of costly market imperfections. A \nnumber of empirical studies examine derivative holdings to identify which of \nthe proposed theoretical incentives and imperfections lead to corporate hedg- \ning. Our paper adds to the hedging literature by testing whether corpora- \ntions respond to two tax-related incentives to hedge: the incentive to reduce \nvolatility, thereby increasing debt capacity and the tax benefits of debt, and \nthe inc",

    "title": "Do Firms Rebalance Their Capital Structures?",
    "abstract": "We empirically examine whether firms engage in a dynamic rebalancing of their cap-\nital structures while allowing for costly adjustment. We begin by showing that the\npresence of adjustment costs has significant implications for corporate financial policy\nand the interpretation of previous empirical results. After confirming that financing\nbehavior is consistent with the presence of adjustment costs, we find that firms ac-\ntively rebalance their leverage to stay within an optimal range. Our evidence suggests\nthat the persistent effect of shocks on leverage observed in previous studies is more\nlikely due to adjustment costs than indifference toward capital structure.\nA TRADITIONAL VIEW IN CORPORATE FINANCE is that firms strive to maintain an opti-\nmal capital structure that balances the costs and benefits associated with vary-\ning degrees of financial leverage. When firms are perturbed from this optimum,\nthis view argues that companies respond by rebalancing their leverage back to\nthe optimal level. However, recent empirical evidence has led researchers to\nquestion whether firms actually engage in such a dynamic rebalancing of their\ncapital structures.\nFama and French (2002), among others, note that firms’ debt ratios adjust\nslowly toward their targets. That is, firms appear to take a long time to return\ntheir leverage to its long-run mean or, loosely speaking, optimal level.

    "abstract": "We show that peer ﬁrms play an important role in determining corporate capital\nstructures and ﬁnancial policies. In large part, ﬁrms’ ﬁnancing decisions are responses\nto the ﬁnancing decisions and, to a lesser extent, the characteristics of peer ﬁrms.\nThese peer effects are more important for capital structure determination than most\npreviously identiﬁed determinants. Furthermore, smaller, less successful ﬁrms are\nhighly sensitive to their larger, more successful peers, but not vice versa. We also\nquantify the externalities generated by peer effects, which can amplify the impact of\nchanges in exogenous determinants on leverage by over 70%.\nMOST RESEARCH ON CORPORATE ﬁnancial policy assumes that capital structure\nchoices are made independently of the actions or characteristics of their peers.\nIn other words, a ﬁrm’s capital structure is typically assumed to be determined\nas a function of its marginal tax rate, expected deadweight loss in default,\ninformation environment, and incentive structure. As such, the role for peer\nﬁrm behavior in affecting capital structure is often ignored, or at most im-\nplicitly assumed to operate through its unmeasured impact on ﬁrm-speciﬁc\ndeterminants.\nHowever, peer ﬁrms play a central role in shaping a number of corporate\npolicies, and existing evidence suggests that the behavior of peer ﬁrms may\nmatter for capital structure.\n1 Survey evidence indicates that a signiﬁcant\n∗Leary is with Olin Business School, Washington University in St. Louis, an",

    "abstract": "By the end of January 2001, all NYSE stocks had converted their price quota- \ntions from l/8s and l/16s to decimals. This study examines the effect of this \nchange in price quotations on ex-dividend day activity. We find that abnormal \nex-dividend day returns increase in the 1/16 and decimal pricing eras, relative \nto the 1/8 era, which is inconsistent with microstructure explanations of ex- \nday price movements. We also find that abnormal returns increase in conjunc- \ntion with a May 1997 reduction in the capital gains tax rate, as they should if \nrelative taxation of dividends and capital gains affects ex-day pricing. \nIf capital markets were perfect, a stock's price would fall by the amount of the \ndividend on the ex-day. Instead, the ratio of price drop to dividend, known as \nthe ex-day premium, has been consistently below one for decades (e.g., Elton \nand Gruber (1970), Michaely (1991), or Eades, Hess and Kim (1994)). Several lines \nof reasoning have developed to explain the ex-day phenomenon: (1) differential \ntaxation between dividends and capital gains, (2) the interaction of taxes and \ntransactions costs to trading stocks, and (3) price discreteness and bid-ask \nbounce.

Using a larger sample with com- \nprehensive bond data, we find evidence consistent with wealth expropriation. \nBondholders, on average, suffer a significant negative abnormal return during \nthe month of the spin-off announcement. However, even accounting for the loss \nto the bondholders, the aggregate value of the publicly traded debt and equity \nincreases on a spin-off announcement, suggesting that the wealth expropria- \ntion hypothesis is not a complete explanation of the stockholder gains. In ex- \nplaining the magnitude of the losses to bondholders, we find they are a \nfunction of the loss in collateral in the spun-off subsidiary and the level of fi- \nnancial risk of the parent firm. Consistent with a loss to bondholders, firms are \nmore likely to have their credit rating downgraded than upgraded after a spin- \noff.

    "abstract": "This paper finds support for the hypothesis that overvalued firms create value for\nlong-term shareholders by using their equity as currency. Any approach centered on\nabnormal returns is complicated by the fact that the most overvalued firms have the\ngreatest incentive to engage in stock acquisitions. We solve this endogeneity problem\nby creating a sample of mergers that fail for exogenous reasons. We find that unsuc-\ncessful stock bidders significantly underperform successful ones. Failure to consum-\nmate is costlier for richly priced firms, and the unrealized acquirer-target combination\nwould have earned higher returns. None of these results hold for cash bids.\nTHE LATE 1990S WITNESSED a large mergers and acquisitions wave. Many transac-\ntions involved equity as the mode of payment (Andrade, Mitchell, and Stafford\n(2001), Holmstrom and Kaplan (2001)), and this equity was usually very richly\nvalued by historical standards. The positive correlation between market valu-\nation and merger activity has also been documented in other periods (Martin\n(1996), Verter (2002)) and is especially strong for stock deals (Maksimovic and\nPhillips (2001)). One interpretation of this evidence is that managers try to\ntime the market by paying with stock when they believe it is overvalued.\nRecently, a number of papers formally recognized this link between possible\nmispricing and acquisition activity.

    "abstract": "In the presence of frictions, firms adjust their capital structure infrequently.

This paper explores the empirical\nimplications of this observation. I use a calibrated dynamic trade-off model to simulate\nfirms’ capital structure paths. The results of standard cross-sectional tests on these\ndata are consistent with those reported in the empirical literature.

Past book-to-market ratios predict current\ncapital structure. Firms seem to use debt financing too conservatively, and the\nleverage of stable, profitable firms appears particularly low.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the pricing of bank loans relative to capital market debt. The\nanalysis uses a novel sample of loans matched with bond spreads from the same ﬁrm\non the same date. After accounting for seniority, lenders earn a large premium relative\nto the bond-implied credit spread. In a sample of secured term loans to noninvestment-\ngrade ﬁrms, the average premium is 140 to 170 bps or about half of the all-in-drawn\nspread. This is the ﬁrst direct evidence of ﬁrms’ willingness to pay for bank credit and\nraises questions about the nature of competition in the loan market.\nTHE TWO PRIMARY SOURCES OFdebt for ﬁrms are private bank loans and public\nbonds issued in the market.

    "abstract": "We analyze several hundred firms that expand via acquisition and/or increase \ntheir number of business segments. The combined market reaction to acquisition \nannouncements is positive but acquiring firm excess values decline after the di- \nversifying event. Much of the excess value reduction occurs because our sample \nfirms acquire already discounted business units, and not because diversifying de- \nstroys value. This implies that the standard assumption that conglomerate divi- \nsions can be benchmarked to typical stand-alone firms should be carefully \nreconsidered. We also show that excess value does not decline when firms increase \ntheir number of business segments because of pure reporting changes. \nDOES CORPORATE DIVERSIFICATION destroy value?

    "title": "Does Corporate Headquarters Location Matter for Stock Returns?",
    "abstract": "We document strong comovement in the stock returns of firms headquartered in the\nsame geographic area. Moreover, stocks of companies that change their headquarters\nlocation experience a decrease in their comovement with stocks from the old location\nand an increase in their comovement with stocks from the new location. The local co-\nmovement of stock returns is not explained by economic fundamentals and is stronger\nfor smaller firms with more individual investors and in regions with less financially\nsophisticated residents. We argue that price formation in equity markets has a sig-\nnificant geographic component linked to the trading patterns of local residents.\nFINANCIAL ECONOMISTS DOCUMENT A STRONG bias in the portfolio holdings of vari-\nous classes of investors towards local companies. 1 However, researchers tend\nto disagree about the underlying reasons for such a bias with possible expla-\nnations varying from observational learning and the social interactions of in-\nvestors (e.g., Brown et al. (2004)) to asymmetric information (e.g., Coval and\nMoskowitz (2001)). Despite the increased interest in investors’ location-related\npreferences, the economic implication of locality for the pricing of publicly\ntraded equity remains a largely unexplored question. If locality matters for\nasset pricing, then geography, in general, and the local bias, in particular, could\nhave important implications for cost of capital calculations, performance eval-\nuations, and asset allocation decision",

NASDAQ ﬂuctuations during the book-\nbuilding phase are used as an instrument for IPO completion. Using patent-based\nmetrics, I ﬁnd that the quality of internal innovation declines following the IPO, and\nﬁrms experience both an exodus of skilled inventors and a decline in the productivity\nof the remaining inventors. However, public ﬁrms attract new human capital and\nacquire external innovation. The analysis reveals that going public changes ﬁrms’\nstrategies in pursuing innovation.\nDOES THE TRANSITION TO PUBLICequity markets affect innovation?

    "abstract": "We uncover a negative relation between herding behavior and skill in the mutual fund\nindustry. Our new, dynamic measure of fund-level herding captures the tendency of\nfund managers to follow the trades of the institutional crowd. We ﬁnd that herd-\ning funds underperform their antiherding peers by over 2% per year. Differences in\nskill drive this performance gap: Antiherding funds make superior investment deci-\nsions even on stocks not heavily traded by institutions, and can anticipate the trades\nof the crowd; furthermore, the herding-antiherding performance gap is persistent,\nwider when skill is more valuable, and larger among managers with stronger career\nconcerns.\nTHEORIES OF HERDING BEHAVIOR PREDICT THAT people tend to “follow the crowd”\nfor a variety of reasons, for instance, to appear as talented as others or to\nlearn from others.1 One important yet underexplored feature of these models\nis the idea that less skilled individuals may herd on the decisions of their\npredecessors, while those with superior ability may be more likely to deviate\nfrom past actions—to the point of exhibiting antiherding behavior. Despite the\nrich implications of this intuition, however, there is little empirical evidence on\nthe relationship between skill and the tendency to follow the crowd.\nIn this paper, we investigate the link between herding behavior and skill\nin the context of the mutual fund industry, which is an ideal setting to study\nthe relation between herding and skill for two reasons.",

As a result, the unconditional alpha\nis a downward-biased estimate of the true alpha. We model the conditional market\nrisk for beta-sorted portfolios using instrumental variables methods and ﬁnd that the\nconditional CAPM resolves the beta anomaly.\nTHE SHARPE-LINTNER CAPITAL asset pricing model (CAPM) implies that expo-\nsure to market risk, as measured by beta, should be compensated by the mar-\nket risk premium.

    "abstract": "We investigate the effect of poor performance on ﬁnancial intermediary reputation by\nestimating the effect of large-scale bankruptcies among a lead arranger’s borrowers\non its subsequent syndication activity. Consistent with reputation damage, such lead\narrangers retain larger fractions of the loans they syndicate, are less likely to syn-\ndicate loans, and are less likely to attract participant lenders. The consequences are\nmore severe when borrower bankruptcies suggest inadequate screening or monitor-\ning by the lead arranger. However, the effect of borrower bankruptcies on syndication\nactivity is not present among dominant lead arrangers, and is weak in years in which\nmany lead arrangers experience borrower bankruptcies.\nINVESTORS DELEGATE THE TASK of screening and monitoring ﬁrms to special-\nized ﬁnancial intermediaries such as banks and underwriters (Leland and\nPyle (1977) and Diamond (1984)). A downside to such delegation is that it\ncan introduce a layer of information and incentive problems between ﬁnancial\nintermediaries and investors.

Using 90 subsidiary and 37 parent\nseasoned equity offering (SEO) announcements during 1981–2002, I document neg-\native returns to issuers but insignificant returns to nonissuers in both samples, and\ninsignificant changes in combined firm value and parent’s nonsubsidiary equity value\nin subsidiary SEOs.

The combination of synergistic businesses and separation of\nnonsynergistic businesses is believed to increase the combined value of firms.\nSometimes, however, the acquiring firm seeks only a partial stake in a target\nfirm, or the divesting firm sells only a partial stake in a divested unit.

    "abstract": "Agency theories predict that the value of corporate cash holdings is less in countries\nwith poor investor protection because of the greater ability of controlling shareholders\nto extract private benefits from cash holdings in such countries. Using various spec-\nifications of the valuation regressions of Fama and French (1998), we find that the\nrelation between cash holdings and firm value is much weaker in countries with poor\ninvestor protection than in other countries. In further support of the importance of\nagency theories, the relation between dividends and firm value is weaker in countries\nwith stronger investor protection.\nACCORDING TO AGENCY THEORIES , THOSE who control firms do so to further their\nown interests. When corporate governance works well, those in control of a cor-\nporation, whom we refer to as controlling shareholders, find it more beneficial\nto increase shareholder wealth than to expropriate minority shareholders. In\ncontrast, with poor corporate governance, controlling shareholders can derive\nsubstantial private benefits from control at the expense of minority sharehold-\ners (see, for instance, Dyck and Zingales (2004) and Nenova (2003)).\nAs Myers and Rajan (1998) argue, liquid assets can be turned into private\nbenefits at lower cost than other assets.

    "abstract": "We solve the portfolio problem of a long-run investor when the term structure is\nGaussian and when the investor has access to nominal bonds and stock. We apply our\nmethod to a three-factor model that captures the failure of the expectations hypothesis.\nWe extend this model to account for time-varying expected inflation, and estimate\nthe model with both inflation and term structure data. The estimates imply that the\nbond portfolio of a long-run investor looks very different from the portfolio of a mean-\nvariance optimizer. In particular, time-varying term premia generate large hedging\ndemands for long-term bonds.\nTHE EXPECTATIONS HYPOTHESIS OF INTEREST RATES states that the premium on long-\nterm bonds over short-term bonds is constant over time. According to this hy-\npothesis, there are no particularly good times to invest in long-term bonds\nrelative to short-term bonds, nor are there particularly bad times. Long-term\nbonds will always offer the same expected excess return.\n1\nWhile the expectations hypothesis is theoretically appealing, it has consis-\ntently failed in U.S. postwar data. Fama and Bliss (1987) and Campbell and\nShiller (1991), among others, show that expected excess returns on long-term\nbonds (term premia) do vary over time, and moreover, it is possible to predict\nexcess returns on bonds using observables such as the forward rate or the term\nspread.

Deposits create value by lowering funding\ncosts. However, when the bank is undercapitalized and at risk of breaching leverage\nrequirements, the marginal value of deposits can turn negative as deposit inﬂows,\nby raising leverage, increase the likelihood of costly equity issuance.

    "abstract": "We study optimal compensation in a dynamic framework where the CEO consumes\nin multiple periods, can undo the contract by privately saving, and can temporarily\ninﬂate earnings. We obtain a simple closed-form contract that yields clear predic-\ntions for how the level and performance sensitivity of pay vary over time and across\nﬁrms. The contract can be implemented by escrowing the CEO’s pay into a “Dynamic\nIncentive Account” that comprises cash and the ﬁrm’s equity. The account features\nstate-dependent rebalancing to ensure its equity proportion is always sufﬁcient to\ninduce effort, and time-dependent vesting to deter short-termism.\nMANY CLASSICAL MODELS OF CEO compensation consider only a single period,\nor multiple periods with a single terminal consumption. However, the optimal\nstatic contract may be ineffective in a dynamic world. In reality, securities\ngiven to incentivize the CEO may lose their power over time: if ﬁrm value\ndeclines, options may fall out of the money and bear little sensitivity to the\nstock price. The CEO may be able to engage in private saving to achieve a\nhigher future income than intended by the contract, in turn reducing his ef-\nfort incentives. Single-period contracts can encourage the CEO to engage in\nshort-termism/myopia, that is, inﬂate the current stock price at the expense\nof long-run value. In addition to the above challenges, a dynamic setting pro-\nvides opportunities to the ﬁrm—it can reward effort with future rather than\ncurrent pay.\nThis pa",

Speciﬁcally, the optimal updated\nportfolio is a linear combination of the existing portfolio and an “aim portfolio,” which\nis a weighted average of the current Markowitz portfolio (the moving target) and\nthe expected Markowitz portfolios on all future dates (where the target is moving).\nIntuitively, predictors with slower mean-reversion (alpha decay) get more weight in\nthe aim portfolio.

We\nﬁnd that on days when activists accumulate shares, measures of adverse selection\nand of stock illiquidity are lower, even though prices are positively impacted. Two\nchannels help explain this phenomenon: (1) activists select times of higher liquidity\nwhen they trade, and (2) activists use limit orders. We conclude that, when informed\ntraders can select when and how to trade, standard measures of adverse selection\nmay fail to capture the presence of informed trading.\nAn extensive body of theory suggests that stock illiquidity, as measured by\nthe bid-ask spread and by the price impact of trades, should be increas-\ning in the information asymmetry between market participants (Glosten and\nMilgrom (1985), Kyle (1985), Easley and O’Hare (1987)).

This\nforesight leads to a novel feedback effect between prices and market liquidity, which\nare jointly determined in equilibrium. The model also predicts that contagious sell-offs\ncan occur after sufﬁciently bad news.\nASSET MARKETS ARE SUSCEPTIBLE to periods of illiquidity.

Thus, managers’ compensation is maximized at a\nmuch larger fund size than is optimal for fund performance.

    "abstract": "We examine heterogeneity in depositor responses to solvency risk using depositor-\nlevel data for a bank that faced two different runs. We ﬁnd that depositors with loans\nand bank staff are less likely to run than others during a low-solvency-risk shock, but\nare more likely to run during a high-solvency-risk shock. Uninsured depositors are\nalso sensitive to bank solvency. In contrast, depositors with older accounts run less,\nand those with frequent past transactions run more, irrespective of the underlying\nrisk. Our results show that the fragility of a bank depends on the composition of its\ndeposit base.\nWHO RUNS ON A BANK, AND why? We know that runs are related to bank solvency\nin aggregate (Saunders and Wilson (1996), Calomiris and Mason (1997)). Yet\ndeposits are not a homogeneous mass—they are held by people with different\nhistories and different relationships to their banks. A person with only a mod-\nest checking account, for example, may not bother to learn about her bank’s\nﬁnancial health, whereas those with higher balances or a broader relationship\n(e.g., they also hold a loan) may know more about their bank and as a result\nhave more reason to act on that knowledge, since their ﬁnancial well-being\nis tied up with their bank’s.1 Following this line of thought, if some kinds of\ndepositors are more or less sensitive to the solvency risk of their bank, then the\nmake-up of a bank’s deposit base may be an important determinant of stability.\nTreating deposits as held by heterog",

    "abstract": "A model of infrequent rebalancing can explain speciﬁc predictability patterns in the\ntime series and cross-section of stock returns. First, infrequent rebalancing produces\nreturn autocorrelations that are consistent with empirical evidence from intraday\nreturns and new evidence from daily returns. Autocorrelations can switch sign and\nbecome positive at the rebalancing horizon. Second, the cross-sectional variance in\nexpected returns is larger when more traders rebalance. This effect generates season-\nality in the cross-section of stock returns, which can help explain available empirical\nevidence.\nHESTON,K ORAJCZYK, AND SADKA (2010) document a striking pattern of period-\nicity in intraday returns.

When projects have correlated outcomes, learning the state of one\nproject (via enforcement) provides information about the states of other projects.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a theory of liquidity dynamics. Illiquidity results from asymmet-\nric information. Observing the historical track record teaches agents how to interpret\npublic information and helps overcome information asymmetry. However, an illiquid-\nity trap can arise: too much asymmetric information leads to the breakdown of trade,\nwhich interrupts learning and perpetuates illiquidity. Liquidity falls in response to\nunexpected events that lead agents to question their valuation models (especially\nin newer markets) may be slow to recover after a crisis, and is higher in periods of\nstability.\nTHIS PAPER PROPOSES A THEORY OF MARKET LIQUIDITYand its evolution over time.\nThis theory is based on the interaction between information asymmetry and\nsocial learning.\nLiquidity is an elusive concept, with the literature on it plagued by challenges\nof both deﬁnition and measurement.1 In this paper, I refer to the following\nnotion of liquidity: The liquidity of an asset class is the fraction of the potential\ngains from trade in that asset class that are realized in equilibrium. If the\npotential gains from trade are large, it is tautologically true that asset liquidity\nhas important consequences for social welfare.\nThe theory in this paper is based on a minor modiﬁcation of an otherwise\nstandard model of trade under asymmetric information in the spirit of Akerlof\n(1970).

    "abstract": "We argue that tests of reduced-form factor models and horse races between “character-\nistics” and “covariances” cannot discriminate between alternative models of investor\nbeliefs. Since asset returns have substantial commonality, absence of near-arbitrage\nopportunities implies that the stochastic discount factor can be represented as a func-\ntion of a few dominant sources of return variation. As long as some arbitrageurs are\npresent, this conclusion applies even in an economy in which all cross-sectional vari-\nation in expected returns is caused by sentiment. Sentiment-investor demand results\nin substantial mispricing only if arbitrageurs are exposed to factor risk when taking\nthe other side of these trades.\nREDUCED-FORM FACTOR MODELS ARE ubiquitous in empirical asset pricing. In\nthese models, the stochastic discount factor (SDF) is represented as a func-\ntion of a small number of portfolio returns. In equity market research, models\nsuch as the three-factor SDF of Fama and French ( 1993) and various exten-\nsions are popular with academics and practitioners alike. These models are\nreduced-form because they are not derived from assumptions about investor\nbeliefs, preferences, and technology that prescribe which factors should appear\nin the SDF.

    "abstract": "We introduce a methodology to estimate the historical time series of returns to invest-\nment in private equity funds. The approach requires only an unbalanced panel of cash\ncontributions and distributions accruing to limited partners and is robust to sparse\ndata. We decompose private equity returns from 1994 to 2015 into a component due\nto traded factors and a time-varying private equity premium not spanned by publicly\ntraded factors. We ﬁnd cyclicality in private equity returns that differs according to\nfund type and is consistent with the conjecture that capital market segmentation\ncontributes to private equity returns.\nPRIVATE EQUITY (PE) IS A MAJOR institutional asset class and represents a sig-\nniﬁcant fraction of investments by colleges, foundations, pension funds, and\nsovereign wealth funds, among others. A major drawback of PE for purposes of\nanalysis is the lack of transactions-based performance measures. This greatly\nhampers portfolio allocation choice, which typically requires information about\nthe risk, return, and covariance of asset classes.

Although both sources of disagreement are important, our ﬁndings suggest\nthat information differences are more important for trading than differences across\nmarket approaches.\nDISAGREEMENT AMONG INVESTORS HAS LONG been thought to be central to trading\nin ﬁnancial markets. Indeed, it is difﬁcult to explain why investors would\ntrade at all without some source of disagreement (Milgrom and Stokey ( 1982),\nKarpoff ( 1986)). Motivated in part by this observation, a growing literature\nexamines the effects of investor disagreement on ﬁnancial market outcomes\n∗J.

The downward earnings manage-\nment increases with both the percentage of the company that managers repurchase\nand CEO ownership. Pre-repurchase abnormal accruals are also negatively associ-\nated with future performance, with the association driven mainly by those firms that\nreport the largest income-decreasing abnormal accruals. The study suggests that one\nreason firms experience post-repurchase abnormal returns is that post-repurchase\nrealized earnings growth exceeds expectations formed on the basis of pre-repurchase\ndeflated earnings numbers.\nThe last two decades have seen a proliferation of stock repurchases.

The existing \nliterature interprets these findings as inefficiencies arising from coordination prob- \nlems among many creditors or an inefficient design of bankruptcy law. In contrast, \nthis paper emphasizes that creditors lack the information that is needed to make \nquick and correct liquidation decisions. It can explain the long-term nature of fi- \nnancial distress solely as the result of dynamic learning strategies of creditors and \nsuggests that it may be an unavoidable byproduct of an efficient resolution of \nfinancial distress. \nFINANCIAL DISTRESS IS OFTEN a long-term process and has an impact on the \ncapital structure, investment policies, and performance of many firms even \nafter they emerge from debt restructurings.

We document\nwidespread economic nationalism in which the government prefers that target com-\npanies remain domestically owned rather than foreign-owned. This preference is\nstronger in times and countries with strong far-right parties and weak governments.\nNationalist government reactions have both direct and indirect economic impacts on\nmergers.

The results show a significant increase in the informa-\ntional role of trading following economic announcements, which suggests the release\nof public information increases the level of information asymmetry in the government\nbond market. The informational role of trading is greater after announcements with a\nlarger initial price impact, and the relation is associated with the surprise component\nof the announcement and the precision of the public information.

The subject is particularly impor-\ntant in today’s environment. Congress, stock exchanges, and individual firms\nhave instituted dramatic governance changes.

We examine the extent to which the \ncross-sectional data (five different instruments) provide information about the model. \nWe find that the time-series restrictions of the two-factor model are generally con- \nsistent with the data.

Also, \nthe specification test based on the SDF method is as powerful as the one based on \nthe beta method. \nTHE USE OF THE stochastic discount factor (SDF) method for econometric eval- \nuation of asset-pricing models has become common in the recent empirical \nfinance literature.

I test two hypotheses that are consistent with risk-shifting behavior:\n(i) volatility has a positive effect on distressed firms’ investment; (ii) investments\nof distressed firms generate less value during times of high uncertainty. Empirical\nevidence using 40 years of data supports both hypotheses. I further evaluate the\neffect of various firm characteristics on risk shifting, and estimate the costs of the\ninvestment distortion.\nSHAREHOLDERS OF FINANCIALLY distressed firms may have incentives to invest\nin risk-increasing negative-NPV projects, as they reap the benefits if things go\nwell, whereas the bondholders bear the costs if things go poorly.

Such policy depends on the presence and the size \nof severance pay in the CEO's compensation package and on the CEO's influ- \nence on the board of directors regarding his own replacement (i.e., entrench- \nment). We explain when and why the combination of some degree of \nentrenchment and a sizeable severance package is desirable. The analysis of- \nfers predictions about the correlation between entrenchment, severance pay, \nand incentive compensation. \nTHERE ARE SUBSTANTIAL CROSS-SECTIONAL DIFFERENCES in the control exercised by cor- \nporate boards of directors. In some cases, the board can and does fire the CEO at \nwill. In others, directors are effectively the puppets of the CEO and exert inde- \npendent power only in extreme situations. The standard view in the literature is \nthat, ideally, shareholders should have full control of the board of directors and \nthat any form of CEO entrenchment is necessarily undesirable. This position, \nhowever, ignores some important interactions between managerial incentive \nproblems and shareholder activism which we explore here. \nIndeed a CEO's influence on the board frequently reflects not so much a discre- \ntionary choice of shareholders but the endogenous accumulation of power in the \nhands of the incumbent CEO (Hermalin and Weisbach, 1998).

Equilibrium strategies that involve cooperation across markets\nlead to less frequent episodic illiquidity, but cause contagion when cooperation breaks\ndown.\nWHY IS ILLIQUIDITY RARE and episodic? Pastor & Stambaugh (2003) detect only\n14 aggregate low-liquidity months over the time period 1962 to 1999. Despite\nbeing of significant magnitude, most of the episodes were short-lived and were\nfollowed by long periods of liquidity.\n1 The origin of this empirical observation\nstill remains a puzzle. In this paper, we attempt to shed light on this puzzle by\ndeveloping a theoretical model in which a breakdown in cooperation between\ntraders in the market manifests itself in predatory trading. This mechanism\nleads to sudden and short-lived illiquidity.\nWe develop a dynamic model of trading based on liquidity needs. During each\nperiod, a liquidity event may occur in which a trader is required to liquidate a\nlarge block of an asset in a relatively short time period. This",

Our goal is\nto offer a benchmark with which the recent subprime boom and bust can be compared.\nThe model is tractable and delivers plausible orders of magnitude for borrowing\ncapacities, as well as default and trading intensities. We offer simple explanations for\nseveral phenomena in the subprime market, such as the prevalence of teaser rates\nand the clustering of defaults. In our model, both nondiversiﬁable and diversiﬁable\nincome risks reduce debt capacities. Thus, debt capacities need not be higher when a\nlarger fraction of income risk is diversiﬁable.\nONE OF THE MAIN goals of the ﬁnancial system is to make credit widely avail-\nable to potential borrowers. The rapid growth of the U.S. subprime mortgage\nmarket was viewed as an important advance in this direction because banks\nprovided credit to a group of individuals that previously were not considered\ncreditworthy. Subprime lending practices came under close scrutiny, however,\nafter a surge in delinquencies sparked a severe ﬁnancial crisis.1 The general\nbelief is that banks supplied more credit than individuals could afford to repay.\nThis leads to two important questions: what is the borrowing capacity of the\nsubprime population, and what are the resulting default rates when borrowers\nexhaust this capacity?

Finally, in\nempirical analysis, we construct the time series of ICC for the G-7 countries. We find a\npositive relation between the conditional mean and variance of stock returns, at both\nthe country level and the world market level.\nTHE TRADEOFF BETWEEN RISK and return is a central concept in finance. Finance\ntheory generally predicts a positive risk–return relation, both across assets and\nover time. For example, the intertemporal capital asset pricing model (ICAPM)\nof Merton (1973) predicts a positive time-series relation between the conditional\nmean and variance of market returns. However, the empirical evidence on the\nsign of the intertemporal risk–return relation is inconclusive.\n1\nTo explain the mixed nature of the evidence, some researchers have shown\nthat the intertemporal mean–variance relation need not be positive theoret-\nically (e.g., Abel (1988), Backus and Gregory (1993), and Whitelaw (2000)).\nOthers have argued that a positive mean–variance relation emerges when the\nempirical specification includes hedging demands (e.g., Scruggs (1998) and Guo\nan",

However, because of their lower initial mortgage payments relative to\nloan amount, they may be a valuable tool for households that expect higher and more\ncertain future labor income, and that wish to smooth consumption over the life-cycle.\nUsing U.K. household-level panel data, this paper provides evidence in support of\nthis hypothesis and highlights other important beneﬁts of alternative mortgages, in-\ncluding portfolio diversiﬁcation, tax beneﬁts, and a reduction in the transaction costs\nincurred in housing transactions.\nTHE PURCHASE OF A house is the single most important investment decision that\nmany households make during their lifetime.

Since more of this insurance is present \nwhen external debt is denominated in domestic currency rather than in dol- \nlars, this result implies that domestic agents choose excessive dollar debt. \nWe also show that limited financial development reduces the incentives for \nforeign lenders to enter emerging markets.

    "abstract": "While many firms grant executive stock options that can be repriced, other firms\nsystematically restrict or prohibit repricing. This article investigates the determi-\nnants of firms’ repricing policies and the consequences of such policies for executive\nturnover and retention. Firms that have better internal governance, that use more\npowerful stock-based incentives, or that face less shareholder scrutiny are more likely\nto maintain repricing flexibility. Firms that restrict repricing are more vulnerable to\nvoluntary executive turnover following stock price declines. When share price declines\nare severe, restricting firms appear to award unusually large numbers of new options.\nTHE PAST SEVERAL YEARS have witnessed tremendous growth in the use of stock\noptions to compensate corporate executives. Indeed, virtually all of the largest\npublicly traded U.S. firms now rely on stock option plans, and option grants con-\nstitute more than half of the annual pay for chief executive officers (Murphy\n(1999)). A natural consequence of this growth has been an increasing aware-\nness and sophistication among academics, practitioners, and the popular press\nabout how the design and administration of option plans can help to enhance\nor destroy shareholder value.\nAlthough a number of corporate practices pertaining to executive options\nhave elicited controversy, perhaps no such practice has been more controver-\nsial than “repricing,” which involves effectively lowering the exercise prices of\nprevio",

Because such options may climb deep\nin-the-money long before the manager can exercise them, they can exacerbate risk\naversion in project selection. Making the proportion of options that vest a gradually\nincreasing function of the stock price can ensure that appropriate numbers of options\nare retained while they provide risk-taking incentives, but are exercised once they\nhave lost their convexity. “Progressive performance vesting” can allow the firm more\nefficiently to rebalance the manager’s risk-taking incentives.\nDURING THE COURSE OF THE 1990S, EXECUTIVE STOCK OPTIONS (ESOs) became the\nsingle largest component of CEO compensation. While ESOs typically have a\nlong-term (10-year) expiration date, the holder is permitted to exercise prior to\nmaturity once the option has “vested.” The most common ESO plan typically\nallows a ﬁxed number of options to vest at predetermined calendar dates, in-\ndependent of stock price performance. We refer to such options as “calendar\nvesting” stock options, to stress that it is the mere passage of time that causes\nthem to vest.

    "abstract": "This paper examines expected option returns in the context of mainstream asset- \npricing theory. Under mild assumptions, expected call returns exceed those of the \nunderlying security and increase with the strike price. Likewise, expected put re- \nturns are below the risk-free rate and increase with the strike price. S&P index \noption returns consistently exhibit these characteristics. Under stronger assump- \ntions, expected option returns vary linearly with option betas. However, zero-beta, \nat-the-money straddle positions produce average losses of approximately three per- \ncent per week. This suggests that some additional factor, such as systematic sto- \nchastic volatility, is priced in option returns. \nASSET-PRICING THEORY CLAIMS that options, like all other risky securities in an \neconomy, compensate their holders with expected returns that are in accor- \ndance with the systematic risks they require their holders to bear. Options \nwhich deliver payoffs in bad states of the world will earn lower returns than \nthose that deliver their payoffs in good states. The enormous popularity of \noption contracts has arisen, in part, because options allow investors to pre- \ncisely tailor their risks to their preferences.

    "abstract": "This paper argues that the documented discount on diversified firms is not per se \nevidence that diversification destroys value. Firms choose to diversify. We use three \nalternative econometric techniques to control for the endogeneity of the diversifi- \ncation decision, and find evidence supporting the self-selection of diversifying firms. \nWe find a strong negative correlation between a firm's choice to diversify and firm \nvalue. The diversification discount always drops, and sometimes turns into a pre- \nmium. There also exists evidence of self-selection by refocusing firms. These re- \nsults point to the importance of explicitly modeling the endogeneity of the \ndiversification status in analyzing its effect on firm value. \nFirms choose to diversify. They choose to diversify when the benefits of di- \nversification outweigh the costs of diversification and stay focused when \nthey do not. The characteristics of firms that diversify, which make the ben- \nefits of diversification greater than the costs of diversification, may also \ncause firms to be discounted. A proper evaluation of the effect of diversifi- \ncation on firm value should take into account the firm-specific characteris- \ntics that bear both on firm value and on the decision to diversify. \nResearch by Lang and Stulz (1994), Berger and Ofek (1995), and Servaes \n(1996) shows unambiguously that diversified firms trade at a discount rel- \native to nondiversified firms in their industries.

When we allow returns\nto be predictable and introduce wealth shocks calibrated to labor income, transaction\ncosts are able to produce per-annum liquidity premia that are the same order of\nmagnitude as the transaction cost spread.\nA NUMBER OF RECENT PAPERShave found a difference in expected return across\nportfolios sorted on liquidity measures.

    "abstract": "Multiple testing plagues many important questions in ﬁnance such as fund and fac-\ntor selection. We propose a new way to calibrate both Type I and Type II errors. Next,\nusing a double-bootstrap method, we establish at-statistic hurdle that is associated\nwith a speciﬁc false discovery rate (e.g., 5%). We also establish a hurdle that is as-\nsociated with a certain acceptable ratio of misses to false discoveries (Type II error\nscaled by Type I error), which effectively allows for differential costs of the two types\nof mistakes. Evaluating current methods, we ﬁnd that they lack power to detect out-\nperforming managers.\nIN MANAGER SELECTION (OR, EQUIVALENTLY , the selection of factors or trad-\ning strategies), investors can make two types of mistakes. The ﬁrst involves\nselecting a manager who turns out to be unskilled—this is a Type I error, or\na false positive.1 The second error is not selecting or missing a manager that\nthe investor thought was unskilled but was not—this is a Type II error, or a\nfalse negative. Both types of errors display economically important variation.\nOn the false positives side, for instance, one manager might slightly underper-\nform while another manager might have a large negative return. Moreover,\nthe cost of a Type II error is likely different from the cost of a Type I error,\nwith the costs depending on the speciﬁc decision at hand. However, while an\ninvestor may want to pick managers using the criterion that Type I errors are,\nsay, ﬁve times more cost",

This finding raises a question for asset pricing: How are asset prices de-\ntermined if price affects fundamental value, which in turn affects price? In this\nenvironment, by buying assets that others are buying, investors ensure high future\ncash flows for the firm and subsequent high returns for themselves. Hence, investors\nhave an incentive to coordinate, which may generate self-fulfilling beliefs and multiple\nequilibria. Using insights from global games, we pin down investors’ beliefs, analyze\nequilibrium prices, and show that strong feedback leads to higher excess volatility.\nACCORDING TO TRADITIONAL VALUATION MODELS , a firm’s stock price is determined\nby its exogenously given cash flow. However, recent finance literature ques-\ntions whether the cash flow is exogenous. For example, Subrahmanyam and\nTitman (2001) argue that a firm’s stock price affects how the firm is perceived\nby its customers, suppliers, employees, lenders, and other stakeholders. In turn,\nthese perceptions influence purchase, supply, and investment decisions, which\nultimately affect the firm’s cash flow. This direct feedback from asset prices to\nasset cash flows receives further support from recent empirical findings.\n1\nIn this paper, we allow for endogenous cash flows in an asset pricing model to\naddress the following question: How do we determine asset prices in the pres-\nence of feedback effects?

The stock price reﬂects informa-\ntion about both the project’s cash ﬂows and its discount rate. A cash-ﬂow-maximizing\nmanager treats discount rate ﬂuctuations as “noise,” but a price-maximizing manager\ninterprets such variation as information about the project’s net present value. This\ndifference qualitatively changes how investment behavior varies with the project’s\nrisk exposure. Moreover, traditional objectives (e.g., cash ﬂow or price maximization)\nneed not maximize welfare because they do not correctly account for hedging and\nrisk-sharing beneﬁts of investment.\nSINCE HAYEK (1945), IT HAS BEEN recognized that prices aggregate\ninformation that is dispersed across the economy and convey it to real\ndecision makers.

    "abstract": "Do ﬁnancial crises radicalize voters? We study Germany’s 1931 banking crisis, collect-\ning new data on bank branches and ﬁrm-bank connections. Exploiting cross-sectional\nvariation in precrisis exposure to the bank at the center of the crisis, we show that\nNazi votes surged in locations more affected by its failure. Radicalization in response\nto the shock was exacerbated in cities with a history of anti-Semitism. After the Nazis\nseized power, both pogroms and deportations were more frequent in places affected\nby the banking crisis. Our results suggest an important synergy between ﬁnancial\ndistress and cultural predispositions, with far-reaching consequences.\nSebastian Doerr is at the Bank for International Settlements.

    "abstract": "This paper uses a new methodology based on industry comovement to examine the role\nof financial market development in intersectoral allocation. Based on the assumption\nthat there exist common global shocks to growth opportunities, we hypothesize that\ncountry pairs should have correlated patterns of sectoral growth if they are able to\nrespond to these shocks. Consistent with financial markets promoting responsiveness\nto shocks, countries have more highly correlated growth rates across sectors when\nboth countries have well-developed financial markets. This effect is stronger between\ncountry pairs at similar levels of economic development, which are more likely to\nexperience similar growth shocks.\nECONOMISTS HAVE LONG CLAIMED that financial market institutions perform an im-\nportant function in the development process, particularly through their role in\nallocating resources to their most productive uses. This allocative role of finan-\ncial institutions was recognized first by Schumpeter (1912), who conjectured\nthat bankers help to identify entrepreneurs with good growth prospects, and\ntherefore help to reallocate resources to their most productive uses. If this is the\ncase, then well-developed financial institutions are crucial to an efficient allo-\ncation of resources in response to shocks to growth opportunities. In light of this\nproposed function, a test of the role of financial development in the allocation of\nresources would involve examining whether financial development h",

In our model, expertise improves ﬁrms’ ability to estimate value when\ntrading a security. Expertise creates asymmetric information, which, under normal\ncircumstances, works to the advantage of the expert as it deters opportunistic bar-\ngaining by counterparties. This advantage is neutralized in equilibrium, however, by\noffsetting investments by competitors. Moreover, when volatility rises the adverse\nselection created by expertise triggers breakdowns in liquidity, destroying gains to\ntrade and thus the beneﬁts that ﬁrms hope to gain through high levels of expertise.\nTHE FINANCIAL SECTOR ATTRACTS extremely qualiﬁed workers.

Be-\ncause rationals arbitrage away distortions caused by cursed traders, mixed markets\ncan generate even more trade.

Introducing slightly over-\nconfident traders increases bid–ask spreads, hurting all traders.

Whether\nthese factors constrain growth depends on firm size. It is consistently the smallest\nfirms that are most constrained.

There is only a weak relation between firms’\nperception of the quality of the courts in their country and firm growth.

With moral hazard, if the entrepre- \nneur's effort is more efficient (less costly) than the advisor's effort, the latter is \nnot hired if she does not provide funds.

    "abstract": "I exploit the adoption of state-level labor protection laws as an exogenous increase in \nemployee firing costs to examine how the costs associated with discharging workers \naffect capital structure decisions. I find that firms reduce debt ratios following the \nadoption of these laws, with this result stronger for firms that experience larger \nincreases in firing costs. I also document that, following the adoption of these laws, a \nfirm’s degree of operating leverage rises, earnings variability increases, and \nemployment becomes more rigid. Overall, these results are consistent with higher \nfiring costs crowding out financial leverage via increasing financial distress costs.",

    "abstract": "This paper develops a top-down model of capital budgeting in which privately in-\nformed executives make investment choices that convey information to the ﬁrm’s\nstakeholders (e.g., employees). Favorable information in this setting encourages\nstakeholders to take actions that positively contribute to the ﬁrm’s success (e.g.,\nemployees work harder). Within this framework we examine how ﬁrms may distort\ntheir investment choices to inﬂuence the information conveyed to stakeholders and\nshow that investment rigidities and overinvestment can arise as optimal investment\ndistortions. We also examine investment distortions in multi-divisional ﬁrms and\ncompare such distortions to those in single-division ﬁrms.\nTHIS PAPER DEVELOPS Atop-down model of capital allocation in which privately\ninformed executives make investment choices that convey information to the\nﬁrm’s stakeholders. The information conveyed by the executives’ investment\nchoices is relevant because it inﬂuences the actions of the stakeholders, which\nin turn affect the likelihood of the ﬁrm’s success. Speciﬁcally, since higher in-\nvestment expenditures are associated with better ﬁrm prospects, stakeholders,\nwho receive a share of the output, are willing to expend more effort to improve\nthe probability that the ﬁrm will be successful. Within this setting, we examine\nthe optimal design of capital allocation mechanisms.

    "abstract": "The prevalence of pay based on risky ﬁrm outcomes for nonexecutive workers\npresents a puzzling departure from conventional contract theory , which predicts in-\nsurance provision by the ﬁrm. When workers at the same ﬁrm compete against each\nother for promotions, the optimal contract features pay based on ﬁrm outcomes as\ninsurance against promotion risk. The model’s predictions are consistent with many\nobserved phenomena, such as performance-based vesting and overvaluation of eq-\nuity pay by nonexecutive workers. It also generates novel predictions linking a ﬁrm’s\nhierarchy to its workers’ pay structure.\nTHE MORAL HAZARD LITERATURE SUGGESTS that ﬁrms should insure risk-\naverse workers against uncertain ﬁrm outcomes that are beyond their individ-\nual control. Yet, nonexecutive workers in the United States routinely receive\nperformance pay based on uncertain ﬁrm outcomes (Kruse, Blasi, and Park\n(2010)). As Bergman and Jenter (2007, p. 668) point out, the prevalence of\nsuch performance pay for nonexecutive workers “is a puzzle for standard eco-\nnomic theory: any positive incentive effects should be diminished by free-rider\nproblems and overshadowed by the cost of imposing risk on employees.” This\npaper argues that when workers compete against each other for promotions,\nperformance pay based on ﬁrm outcomes can insure against poor promotion\n*Alvin Chen is at the Department of Finance, Stockholm School of Economics.

    "title": "Firm Size and Cyclical Variations in Stock Returns",
    "abstract": "Recent imperfect capital market theories predict the presence of asymmetries in \nthe variation of small and large firms' risk over the economic cycle. Small firms \nwith little collateral should be more strongly affected by tighter credit market \nconditions in a recession state than large, better collateralized ones. This paper \nadopts a flexible econometric model to analyze these implications empirically. Con- \nsistent with theory, small firms display the highest degree of asymmetry in their \nrisk across recession and expansion states, which translates into a higher sensi- \ntivity of their expected stock returns with respect to variables that measure credit \nmarket conditions. \nRECENT IMPERFECT CAPITAL MARKET THEORIES (e.g., Bernanke and Gertler (1989), \nGertler and Gilchrist (1994), Kiyotaki and Moore (1997)) predict that chang- \ning credit market conditions can have very different effects on small and \nlarge firms' risk. Agency costs induced by asymmetry in the information \nheld by firms and their creditors make it necessary for firms to use collat- \neral when borrowing in the credit markets. Small firms, it is argued, typi- \ncally do not have nearly as much collateral as large firms and will not have \nthe same ability to raise external funds. Therefore, small firms will be more \nadversely affected by lower liquidity and higher short-term interest rates. \nSuch theories do not simply have the cross-sectional implication that small \nfirms' risk will be more strongly affected ",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the hedging activities of 119 U.S. oil and gas producers from 1998\nto 2001 and evaluates their effect on firm value. Theories of hedging based on market\nimperfections imply that hedging should increase the firm’s market value (MV). To\ntest this hypothesis, we collect detailed information on the extent of hedging and on\nthe valuation of oil and gas reserves. We verify that hedging reduces the firm’s stock\nprice sensitivity to oil and gas prices. Contrary to previous studies, however, we find\nthat hedging does not seem to affect MVs for this industry.\nIN A CLASSIC MODIGLIANI AND MILLER (M&M) WORLD with perfect capital markets,\nrisk management should be irrelevant. When there are no information asym-\nmetries, taxes, or transaction costs, hedging financial risk should not add value\nto the firm because shareholders can undo any risk management activities im-\nplemented by the firm at the same cost.\nIn practice, imperfections in capital markets create a rationale for lowering\nthe volatility of earnings through hedging. Conventional explanations relate to\nthe cost of financial distress, tax incentives, and the underinvestment problem.\nRisk management may also add value if hedging positions in derivatives con-\ntracts carry a premium that is not commensurate with risk, or if active trading\nactivities create a profit.\nMost empirical studies on this topic focus on the relation between corporate\nhedging and firm characteristics, and try to determine whether the behavior",

We demonstrate that the risk premium and the risk-free rate in these\nmodels are sensitive to ignoring heterogeneity. This follows because of endogenous\nwithdrawal by nonexpected utility agents from the market for the risky asset. This\nfinding is important precisely because these alternative preferences have frequently\nbeen proposed as possible resolutions to various asset pricing puzzles, and they have\nall been examined exclusively in a representative agent framework.\nTHE WELL -DOCUMENTED shortcomings of asset pricing models based, in part, on\nthe expected utility (EU) hypothesis has motivated a large and rapidly grow-\ning set of pricing models that incorporate nonexpected utility preferences.

Using the\nmortgage market as a laboratory, we conjecture that lenders with a large share of\noutstanding mortgages on their balance sheets internalize the negative spillovers\nassociated with the liquidation of defaulting mortgages and thus are less inclined to\nforeclose.

The relationship then follows from a general options-pricing result: For\na levered firm, expected returns should always decrease with the level of idiosyn-\ncratic asset risk.

    "abstract": "Technical analysis, also known as \"charting,\" has been a part of financial practice \nfor many decades, but this discipline has not received the same level of academic \nscrutiny and acceptance as more traditional approaches such as fundamental analy- \nsis. One of the main obstacles is the highly subjective nature of technical analy- \nsis-the presence of geometric shapes in historical price charts is often in the eyes \nof the beholder. In this paper, we propose a systematic and automatic approach to \ntechnical pattern recognition using nonparametric kernel regression, and we apply \nthis method to a large number of U.S. stocks from 1962 to 1996 to evaluate the \neffectiveness of technical analysis. By comparing the unconditional empirical dis- \ntribution of daily stock returns to the conditional distribution-conditioned on spe- \ncific technical indicators such as head-and-shoulders or double-bottoms-we find \nthat over the 31-year sample period, several technical indicators do provide incre- \nmental information and may have some practical value. \nONE OF THE GREATEST GULFS between academic finance and industry practice \nis the separation that exists between technical analysts and their academic \ncritics. In contrast to fundamental analysis, which was quick to be adopted \nby the scholars of modern quantitative finance, technical analysis has been \nan orphan from the very start. It has been argued that the difference be- \ntween fundamental analysis and technical analysis is not unlik",

    "abstract": "We show theoretically that a critical determinant of the attractiveness of venture\ncapital (VC)-backed entrepreneurship for high-earning potential founders is the ex-\npected time to develop a startup’s initial product. This is because founder-CEOs’ cash\ncompensation increases substantially after product development, alleviating the non-\ndiversiﬁable risk that founders face at startup birth. Consistent with the model’s pre-\ndictions of where the supply of entrepreneurial talent is likely to be most constrained,\nwe ﬁnd that technological shocks differentially altering the expected time to product\nacross industries can explain changes in both the rate of entry and characteristics of\nindividuals selecting into VC-backed entrepreneurship.\nVENTURE CAPITAL (VC)-BACKED STARTUPS PLAY a critical role in the econ-\nomy due to their disproportionate contribution to corporate R&D and innova-\ntion (Kortum and Lerner ( 2000), Lerner and Nanda ( 2020)).

    "abstract": "We investigate the relation between founding-family ownership and firm per- \nformance. We find that family ownership is both prevalent and substantial; fa- \nmilies are present in one-third of the S&P 500 and account for 18 percent of \noutstanding equity. Contrary to our conjecture, we find family firms perform \nbetter than nonfamily firms. Additional analysis reveals that the relation be- \ntween family holdings and firm performance is nonlinear and that when fa- \nmily members serve as CEO, performance is better than with outside CEOs. \nOverall, our results are inconsistent with the hypothesis that minority share- \nholders are adversely affected by family ownership, suggesting that family \nownership is an effective organizational structure. \nFOUNDING-FAMILYOWNERSHIPAND CONTROL in public U.S. firms is commonly perceived \nas a less efficient, or at the very least, a less profitable ownership structure than \ndispersed ownership.

Individuals reinvest 83% if a\nforced sale results in a gain relative to the initial investment; but reinvest only 40%\nin the event of a loss. This difference is statistically signiﬁcant for more than six\nmonths and arises because many individuals forced to realize a loss choose not to\nreinvest anything and some even exit the stock market altogether. Individuals treat\nrealized losses differently from paper losses and are discouraged from investing more\nand participating in the stock market.\nTHE SURVEY OF CONSUMER FINANCES (SCF) documents that only 52% of\nhouseholds in the United States participate in the stock market and that these\nhouseholds invest only approximately 40% of their wealth in stocks (Cupák\net al., 2020).

    "abstract": "We propose an exogenous measure of a country’s growth opportunities by interacting\nthe country’s local industry mix with global price to earnings (PE) ratios. We find\nthat these exogenous growth opportunities predict future changes in real GDP and\ninvestment in a large panel of countries. This relation is strongest in countries that\nhave liberalized their capital accounts, equity markets, and banking systems. We also\nfind that financial development, external finance dependence, and investor protection\nmeasures are much less important in aligning growth opportunities with growth than\nis capital market openness. Finally, we formulate new tests of market integration and\nsegmentation by linking local and global PE ratios to relative economic growth.\nIN A PERFECTLY INTEGRATED WORLD economy, capital should be invested where it\nis expected to earn the highest risk-adjusted return. Much of the research on\nreal variables and quantities is strongly at odds with the notion of global inte-\ngration. For example, in their classic study of 16 developed countries, Feldstein\nand Horioka (1980) find a home bias in real investments. In particular, they\nshow that domestic saving rates explain over 90% of the variation in invest-\nment rates. Because the Feldstein and Horioka sample ends in 1974, it does\nnot reflect the considerable progress toward globalization in the 1970s and\n1980s. However, Obstfeld and Rogoff (2000) continue to find a high correlation\nbetween domestic investment and savings f",

Speciﬁcally, we exploit episodes of sensational news (exogenous to the mar-\nket) that distract noise traders. We ﬁnd that on “distraction days,” trading activity,\nliquidity, and volatility decrease, and prices reverse less among stocks owned pre-\ndominantly by noise traders. These outcomes contrast sharply with those due to the\ninattention of informed speculators and market makers, and are consistent with noise\ntraders mitigating adverse selection risk. We discuss the evolution of these outcomes\nover time and the role of technological changes.\nTHE LITERATURE ON LIMITED ATTENTION in ﬁnancial markets focuses on informed\nagents—speculators and market makers—and on the speed with which they\nimpound public information into stock prices.

This problem is common among public firms in many coun- \ntries where the legal system does not effectively protect minority shareholders \nagainst oppression by controlling shareholders. We show that even without any \nexplicit corporate governance mechanisms protecting minority shareholders, con- \ntrolling shareholders can implicitly commit not to expropriate them. Stock prices \nof such companies are significantly higher and firms are more likely go public \nbecause of this reputation effect. Moreover, insiders divest shares gradually over \ntime, at a rate that is negatively related to the degree of moral hazard. \nRECENT EMPIRICAL RESEARCH INDICATES THAT in many countries the relevant cor- \nporate finance issue is not the traditional agency problem between manage- \nment and shareholders, but rather the agency problem between the controlling \nshareholders and the minority shareholders.

    "abstract": "The average distance of U.S. banks from their small corporate borrowers increased\nbefore the global ﬁnancial crisis, especially for banks in competitive counties. Small\ndistant loans are harder to make, so loan quality deteriorated. Surprisingly, such\nlending intensiﬁed as the Fed raised interest rates from 2004. Why? We show that\nbanks’ responses to higher rates led bank deposits to shift into competitive counties.\nShort-horizon bank management recycled these inﬂows into risky loans to distant\nuncompetitive counties. Thus, rate hikes, competition, and managerial short-termism\nexplain why inﬂows “burned a hole” in banks’ pockets and, more generally, increased\nrisky lending.\nDESCRIPTIONS OF FINANCIAL FRENZIES SUGGEST that lenders abandon cau-\ntion in the midst of a boom and become more aggressive (or careless) in their\nlending (see, for example, Aliber and Kindleberger ( 2017), Minsky and Kauf-\nman ( 2008)).

This paper examines the relationship between \nmorning sunshine in the city of a country's leading stock exchange and daily \nmarket index returns across 26 countries from 1982 to 1997. Sunshine is \nstrongly significantly correlated with stock returns. After controlling for sun- \nshine, rain and snow are unrelated to returns.

    "title": "Have Rating Agencies Become More Conservative&#x0003F; Implications for Capital Structure and Debt Pricing",
    "abstract": "Rating agencies have become more conservative in assigning corporate credit ratings\nover the period 1985 to 2009; holding ﬁrm characteristics constant, average ratings\nhave dropped by three notches. This change does not appear to be fully warranted\nbecause defaults have declined over this period. Firms affected more by conservatism\nissue less debt, have lower leverage, hold more cash, are less likely to obtain a debt\nrating, and experience lower growth. Their debt spreads are lower than those of\nunaffected ﬁrms with the same rating, which implies that the market partly undoes\nthe impact of conservatism on debt prices. This evidence suggests that ﬁrms and\ncapital markets do not perceive the increase in conservatism to be fully warranted.\nIn the wake of the ﬁnancial crisis, rating agencies have come under increased\nscrutiny. They have been accused of peddling to the companies and institutions\nthat issue the securities they rate, because the issuers pay their fees in most\ninstances. According to some observers, this conﬂict of interest led the agencies\nto relax their standards, leading to ratings that were too generous relative to\nthe default risk of the securities.1 Given that many ﬁnancial institutions made\n∗Baghai is at the Stockholm School of Economics.

    "abstract": "Using a large hand-collected data set from 2001 to 2006, we find that activist hedge\nfunds in the United States propose strategic, operational, and financial remedies and\nattain success or partial success in two-thirds of the cases. Hedge funds seldom seek\ncontrol and in most cases are nonconfrontational. The abnormal return around the\nannouncement of activism is approximately 7%, with no reversal during the subse-\nquent year. Target firms experience increases in payout, operating performance, and\nhigher CEO turnover after activism. Our analysis provides important new evidence\non the mechanisms and effects of informed shareholder monitoring.\nALTHOUGH HEDGE FUND ACTIVISM IS WIDELYdiscussed and fundamentally important,\nit remains poorly understood. Much of the commentary on hedge fund activism\nis based on supposition or anecdotal evidence. Critics and regulators question\nwhether hedge fund activism benefits shareholders, while numerous commen-\ntators claim that hedge fund activists destroy value by distracting managers\nfrom long-term projects.

Large adverse shocks to asset and hedge fund liquidity strongly increase\nthe probability of contagion. Speciﬁcally, large adverse shocks to credit spreads, the\nTED spread, prime broker and bank stock prices, stock market liquidity, and hedge\nfund ﬂows are associated with a signiﬁcant increase in the probability of hedge fund\ncontagion. While shocks to liquidity are important determinants of performance, these\nshocks are not captured by commonly used models of hedge fund returns.\nUSING MONTHLY HEDGE FUND INDEX DATA for the period January 1990 to October\n2008, we ﬁnd that the worst hedge fund returns, deﬁned as returns that fall\nin the bottom 10% of a hedge fund style’s monthly returns, cluster across\nstyles.

While the average\nfund-of-funds delivers alpha only in the period between October 1998 and March 2000,\na subset of funds-of-funds consistently delivers alpha. The alpha-producing funds are\nnot as likely to liquidate as those that do not deliver alpha, and experience far greater\nand steadier capital inflows than their less fortunate counterparts.

Our research shows that swaptions and even swaption straddles \ncan be well hedged with LIBOR bonds alone. We examine the potential bene- \nfits of looking outside the LIBOR market for factors that might impact swap- \ntion prices without impacting swap rates, and find them to be minor, \nindicating that the swaption market is well integrated with the LIBOR-swap \nmarket. \nUNDERSTANDING THE DYNAMICS OF THE TERM structure of interest rates is crucial \nfor pricing and hedging fixed income positions. It is therefore not surprising \nthat this subject continues to attract keen interest.

I use a more accurate measure\nof the interest rate exposure chosen by firms by combining the initial exposure of newly\nissued debt securities with their use of interest rate swaps. The results indicate that\nthe final interest rate exposure is largely driven by the slope of the yield curve at\nthe time the debt is issued. These results suggest that interest rate risk management\npractices are primarily driven by speculation or myopia, not hedging considerations.\nWHEN FIRMS SELECT THE INTEREST RATE exposure of their liabilities and use deriva-\ntives to alter that exposure, are they hedging or timing the market? The em-\npirical literature has attempted to estimate the sources of value creation stem-\nming from hedging by examining the cross-sectional variation in the use of\nderivatives by firms (see Nance, Smith, and Smithson (1993), Mian (1996), and\nGraham and Rogers (2002), for instance). Implicit in most of these examinations\nis the assumption that firms use derivatives solely for the purpose of hedging.\nHowever, before we can estimate the value created by hedging through the se-\nlection of firms’ interest rate exposures, we must document that the choices\nof those exposures are for the purpose of hedging, and not attempts to reduce\ntheir cost of capital.

Instead, they place\na constant fraction of funds in a mean-variance efficient portfolio and the rest in the\nriskless asset, acting as would constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) investors. This\nresult is a direct consequence of the in(de)finite horizon of the contract. We show that\nthe risk-seeking incentives of option-like contracts rely on combining finite horizons\nand convex compensation schemes rather than on convexity alone.\nA POPULAR INTUITION IN FINANCIAL ECONOMICS is that contracts with convex payoffs\ncan potentially increase the incentive to take risks, that is, can induce risk-\nshifting.1 According to this commonly held view, if a manager is rewarded for\ngains but not punished for losses, that manager will only gain from increasing\nunderlying volatility.\nIn this paper, we ask the question: How are the incentives of the manager\naffected if the horizon of the compensation contract is infinite or indefinite?\nOur interest in this question is both practical and theoretical.

    "abstract": "This paper examines whether hostile takeovers can be distinguished from friendly \ntakeovers, empirically, based on accounting and stock performance data. Much has \nbeen made of this distinction in both the popular and the academic literature, \nwhere gains from hostile takeovers result from replacing incumbent managers and \ngains from friendly takeovers result from strategic synergies. Alternatively, hos- \ntility could reflect strategic choices made by the bidder or the target. Empirical \ntests show that most deals described as hostile in the press are not distinguishable \nfrom friendly deals in economic terms, except that hostile transactions involve \npublicity as part of the bargaining process. \nTHE PERCEPTION OF HOSTILITY in American takeovers has had important con- \nnotations in both the popular and the academic literature. Unwelcome bids \nare often perceived to threaten at least some of the stakeholders in target \ncorporations, leading to extensive defensive reactions by the management \nof the target firm. In contrast, friendly takeovers are often seen to create \nsynergies that make both the bidder and the target firm better off (see, for \nexample, M0rck, Shleifer, and Vishny (1988, 1989)). \nThe distinction between hostile and friendly takeovers is also important if \nremoving an inefficient target management team creates the gains from \nhostile takeovers.

    "abstract": "We use a labor-search model to explain why the worst employment slumps often follow\nexpansions of household debt. We ﬁnd that households protected by limited liability\nsuffer from a household-debt-overhang problem that leads them to require high wages\nto work. Firms respond by posting high wages but few vacancies. Thisvacancy posting\neffect implies that high household debt leads to high unemployment.

    "abstract": "We study the causal effect of liquidity constraints on individual labor market out-\ncomes by exploiting the 1992 mortgage reform in Denmark, which for the ﬁrst time\nallowed homeowners to borrow against housing equity for nonhousing purposes. Fol-\nlowing the reform, liquidity-constrained homeowners increased debt levels and had\nhigher earnings growth and lower employment rates. The option to borrow against\nhousing equity enabled liquidity-constrained individuals to move to high-wage jobs\nand invest in valuable human and physical capital. The results imply that relaxing\nhousehold liquidity constraints during recessions can create better job matches, po-\ntentially increasing earnings and output in the longer run.\nA SIGNIFICANT FRACTION OF HOUSEHOLDS are severely liquidity con-\nstrained.

    "abstract": "In a model with housing collateral, the ratio of housing wealth to human wealth shifts\nthe conditional distribution of asset prices and consumption growth. A decrease in\nhouse prices reduces the collateral value of housing, increases household exposure to\nidiosyncratic risk, and increases the conditional market price of risk. Using aggregate\ndata for the United States, we find that a decrease in the ratio of housing wealth\nto human wealth predicts higher returns on stocks. Conditional on this ratio, the\ncovariance of returns with aggregate risk factors explains 80% of the cross-sectional\nvariation in annual size and book-to-market portfolio returns.\nHOUSE PRICE FLUCTUATIONS PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE in explaining the time-series\nand the cross-sectional variation in asset returns. Given the magnitude of the\nhousing market, this is unsurprising. This paper shows that the way in which\nhousing affects asset returns is through the role of housing as a collateral asset.\nWe identify a novel collateral channel that transmits shocks in the housing\nmarket to risk premia. In a model with collateralized borrowing and lending, the\nratio of housing wealth to human wealth, the housing collateral ratio, changes\nthe conditional distribution of consumption growth across households. When\nthe collateral ratio is low, the dispersion of consumption growth across house-\nholds is more sensitive to aggregate consumption growth shocks, and this raises\nthe market price of aggregate risk.\n∗Hanno N.

Analysts\nexhibit heterogeneous skill—some are high-type, and some are low-type. On average,\nthe recommendation revisions of both types exhibit positive abnormal returns. The\nheterogeneity stems from differential ability to produce new information; all analysts\ncan proﬁtably process news. Top analysts outperform because more of their recom-\nmendations are inﬂuential (i.e., associated with statistically signiﬁcant returns) and\nboth their inﬂuential and noninﬂuential recommendations are more informative. A\nmajority of research ﬁrms are also identiﬁed as skilled.\nA FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION IN FINANCIAL economics is whether ﬁnancial profes-\nsionals are able to systematically identify misvalued securities.

    "abstract": "Leverage cross-sections more than a few years apart differ markedly, with similarities\nevaporating as the time between them lengthens. Many ﬁrms have high and low\nleverage at different times, but few keep debt-to-assets ratios consistently above\n0.500. Capital structure stability is the exception, not the rule, occurs primarily at low\nleverage, and is virtually always temporary, with many ﬁrms abandoning low leverage\nduring the post-war boom. Industry-median leverage varies widely over time. Target-\nleverage models that place little or no weight on maintaining a particular ratio do a\ngood job replicating the substantial instability of the actual leverage cross-section.\nTHE VIEW THAT CORPORATE leverage is stable pervades the empirical capital\nstructure literature, and has fostered a belief that the main puzzle facing re-\nsearchers is to explain cross-ﬁrm variation in leverage. Lemmon, Roberts, and\nZender (2008, LRZ) ﬁnd highly signiﬁcant ﬁrm ﬁxed effects in panel leverage\nregressions, and conclude that ﬁrms with high (low) leverage tend to remain as\nsuch for two decades and longer, and that time-varying determinants are un-\nlikely explanations for capital structure heterogeneity.

    "abstract": "While many studies document that the market risk premium is predictable and that\nbetas are not constant, the dividend discount model ignores time-varying risk pre-\nmiums and betas. We develop a model to consistently value cashflows with changing\nrisk-free rates, predictable risk premiums, and conditional betas in the context of a\nconditional CAPM. Practical valuation is accomplished with an analytic term struc-\nture of discount rates, with different discount rates applied to expected cashflows at\ndifferent horizons. Using constant discount rates can produce large misvaluations,\nwhich, in portfolio data, are mostly driven at short horizons by market risk premiums\nand at long horizons by time variation in risk-free rates and factor loadings.\nTO DETERMINE AN APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATE for valuing cashflows, a manager\nis confronted by three major problems: the market risk premium must be esti-\nmated, an appropriate risk-free rate must be chosen, and the beta of the project\nor company must be determined. All three of these inputs into a standard CAPM\nare not constant. Furthermore, cashflows may covary with the risk premium,\nbetas, or other predictive state variables. A standard Dividend Discount Model\n(DDM) cannot handle dynamic betas, risk premiums, or risk-free rates because\nin this valuation method, future expected cashflows are valued at constant\ndiscount rates.\nIn this paper, we present an analytical methodology for valuing stochastic\ncashflows that are correlated with risk pr",

The ﬁrm’s optimal capital\nstructure therefore depends on the trade-off between these human costs and the\ntax beneﬁts of debt. Optimal debt levels consistent with those observed in practice\nemerge without relying on frictions such as moral hazard or asymmetric information.\nConsistent with empirical evidence, persistent idiosyncratic differences in leverage\nacross ﬁrms also result.

Using a model\nin which the aftermarket price of IPO shares depends on the information about the\nintrinsic value of the company and investor sentiment, I show that IPOs can be over-\npriced and still exhibit positive initial return. A sample of recent French offerings with\na fraction of the shares reserved for individual investors supports the predictions of\nthe model. Individual investors’ demand is positively related to market conditions.\nMoreover, large individual investors’ demand leads to high IPO prices, large initial\nreturns, and poor long-run performance.\nTHE END OF THE NINETIES was one of the hottest IPO markets ever. In this period,\nboth the number of initial public offerings and the level of initial returns have\nreached unprecedented peaks.

The evidence is consistent with models of time- \nvarying risk premia based on background risk and investor heterogeneity. \nAlternatively, our findings can be justified by the option value of equity in \nthe capital structure of the firms. \nMOSTASSET PRICING MODELS, starting with Merton's (1973) ICAPM, suggest a positive \nrelation between risk and return for the aggregate stock market. There is a long \nempirical literature that has tried to establish the existence of such a tradeoff \nbetween risk and return for stock market indices.1 Unfortunately, the results \nhave been inconclusive. Often the relation between risk and return has been \nfound insignificant, and sometimes even negative. \nThe innovation in this paper is to look at average stock risk in addition to \nmarket risk. We measure average stock risk in each month similarly to Campbell \net al. (2001; hereafter CLMX), as the cross-sectional average of the variances of \nall the stocks traded in that month. We then run predictive regressions of market \nreturns on this variance measure as well as the variance of the m",

    "abstract": "This paper tests the cross-sectional implications of “keeping-up-with-the-Joneses”\n(KUJ) preferences in an international setting. When agents have KUJ preferences, in\nthe presence of undiversifiable nonfinancial wealth, both world and domestic risk (the\nidiosyncratic component of domestic wealth) are priced, and the equilibrium price of\nrisk of the domestic factor is negative. We use labor income as a proxy for domestic\nwealth and find empirical support for these predictions. In terms of explaining the\ncross-section of stock returns and the size of the pricing errors, the model performs\nbetter than alternative international asset pricing models.\nIN THIS PAPER we test the implications of an international asset pricing model\nwhere agents have preferences that are exogenously defined over both their\nown consumption as well as the contemporaneous average consumption of a\nreference group, defined in this paper as the agent’s countrymen. These pref-\nerences are termed “keeping up with the Joneses” (KUJ).\nIn the absence of frictions, utility based on KUJ preferences yields the sym-\nmetric equilibrium described in Gal´ı (1994), in which all agents hold the same\nglobal portfolio, and Joneses behavior translates into a lower price of risk on\nthe single systematic risk factor.

Since 1981, financially distressed\nstocks have delivered anomalously low returns.

    "abstract": "Little evidence exists that firms index executive compensation to remove the \ninfluence of marketwide factors. We argue that executives can, in principle, \nreplicate such indexation in their private portfolios. In support, we find that \nmarket risk has little effect on the use of stock-based pay for the average execu- \ntive. But executives' ability to \"undo\" excessive market risk can be hindered by \nwealth cohstraints and inalienability of human capital. We replicate the stan- \ndard result that there is little relative performance evaluation (RPE) for the \naverage executive, but find strong evidence of RPE for younger executives \nand executives with less financial wealth. \nRESEARCHERS ARE STARTING TO MAKE SENSE of executive compensation. While there \nstill exists controversy about whether the link between executive compensation \nand stock market value is sufficiently strong, there is no doubt that the link exists, \non average, and has become stronger over time (see Jensen and Murphy (1990), \nHaubrich (1994), and Hall and Liebman (1998)). There is also ample evidence of \nheterogeneity in executive pay packages, as is suggested by contract theory. For \ninstance, Aggarwal and Samwick (1999a) find evidence that firms tie their man- \nagers' pay more closely to stock values when such values are less volatile, confirm- \ning a basic result of principal-agent theory. \nAnother important theoretical prediction comes from Holmstrom (1982), who \nsuggests that the market component of a fir",

Funds with incentive fees exhibit positive stock selection ability, \nbut a beta less than one results in funds not earning positive fees. From an \ninvestor's perspective, positive alphas plus lower expense ratios make incen- \ntive-fee funds attractive. However, incentive-fee funds take on more risk than \nnon-incentive-fee funds, and they increase risk after a period of poor perfor- \nmance. Incentive fees are useful marketing tools, since more new cash flows go \ninto incentive-fee funds than into non-incentive-fee funds, ceteris paribus. \nAN INCENTIVE FEE is a reward structure that makes management compensation a \nfunction of investment performance relative to some benchmark. Incentive fees \nare often used to compensate the manager of investment assets. For example, \nhedge funds typically charge investors a fixed fee plus an incentive fee equal \nto between five percent and 25 percent of the funds annual return. Limited \nliability partnerships, such as commodity partnerships, real estate partnerships, \nand oil and gas partnerships, often charge incentive fees in excess of 20 percent \nof profits. There are a number of reasons why incentive fees are considered \ndesirable. Perhaps the most often cited is that incentive fees align manager inter- \nest with investor interests.

    "abstract": "Human capital is one of the largest assets in the economy and in theory may play\nan important role for asset pricing. Human capital is heterogeneous across investors.\nOne source of heterogeneity is industry afﬁliation. I show that the cross-section of\nexpected stock returns is primarily affected by industry-level rather than aggregate\nlabor income risk. Furthermore, when human capital is excluded from the asset\npricing model, the resulting idiosyncratic risk may appear to be priced. I ﬁnd that the\npremium for idiosyncratic risk documented by several empirical studies depends on\nthe covariance between stock and human capital returns.\nACCORDING TO TRADITIONAL ASSETpricing theory, investors choose their optimal\nportfolios by maximizing the expected utility of their lifetime consumption. In\naddition to investments in tradable assets such as stocks and bonds, part of\ntheir wealth is typically tied up in nontradable assets.

    "abstract": "I examine the effects of information asymmetry–driven mispricing on security is-\nsuance. Using predisclosure changes in purchase obligations as a proxy for informa-\ntion asymmetry–driven mispricing, I ﬁnd that managers avoid (prefer) issuing se-\ncurities when they perceive their ﬁrms to be undervalued (overvalued). The effects\nof information asymmetry–driven mispricing are stronger on equity issuance than\ndebt issuance. Consequently, undervaluation (overvaluation) causes an increase (de-\ncrease) in leverage. These effects are more pronounced for ﬁrms, periods, and securi-\nties associated with greater information asymmetry. The stock-trading patterns that\nmanagers follow suggest that their perceived mispricing is an important factor in\nboth private and ﬁrm-level decisions.\nA MANAGER TYPICALLY HAS SUPERIOR information about his or her ﬁrm’s\nfuture performance relative to what outside investors know. This information\nasymmetry can cause a ﬁrm to be undervalued or overvalued in the market\nrelative to the manager’s perception. Such information asymmetry–driven mis-\npricing may affect a range of managerial decisions.

My evidence supports this\nhypothesis.\nTHERE IS SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE OF SHORT -TERM stock price continuation, which the\nprior literature often attributes to investor underreaction to new information.\nExamples include the positive serial correlation of returns at 3- to 12-month\nhorizons (Jegadeesh and Titman (1993)), post-earnings announcement stock\nprice drift in the direction indicated by the earnings surprise, and post-event\nreturn drift in the direction of the announcement date return.\n1\nIn this paper I investigate how information uncertainty contributes to this\nphenomenon. By information uncertainty, I mean ambiguity with respect to\nthe implications of new information for a firm’s value, which potentially stems\nfrom two sources: the volatility of a firm’s underlying fundamentals and poor\ninformation.\n2 My main hypothesis is tha",

The threat of rotation improves communi-\ncation because self-reporting bad news has a smaller negative effect on an ofﬁcer’s\ncareer prospects than bad news exposed by a successor.\nIN MANY ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIPS, agents are responsible for self-reporting on\nthe performance of their assigned tasks.

    "abstract": "We examine the relation between insiders’ investment horizon and the information\ncontent of their trades with respect to future stock returns. We conjecture that an\ninsider’s investment horizon establishes a benchmark for expected patterns of contin-\nued trading behavior and thus helps identify unexpected insider trades, which should\nbe more informative in efﬁcient markets. Consistent with this conjecture, the trades\nof short-horizon insiders are both more unexpected and more informed, on average,\nthan those of long-horizon insiders. Short-horizon insiders and their ﬁrms also tend\nto display characteristics that are associated with a greater focus on short-termism.\nA LARGE LITERATURE EXPLORES HOW the investment horizon of certain groups\nof investors, such as ﬁnancial institutions, affects corporate policies and\nstock prices. 1 One particular group of investors whose trades are under\nscrutiny by regulators and other market participants is corporate insiders.\nThese individuals have privileged access to material private information and\ncan inﬂuence the ﬁrm’s policies, performance, and stock prices.

    "abstract": "Motivated by extant finance theory predicting that insider trading crowds out private\ninformation acquisition by outsiders, we use data for 100 countries for the years 1987–\n2000 to study whether analyst following in a country increases following restriction of\ninsider trading activities. We document that analyst following increases after initial\nenforcement of insider trading laws. This increase is concentrated in emerging market\ncountries, but is smaller if the country has previously liberalized its capital market.\nWe also find that analyst following responds less intensely to initial enforcement when\na country has a preexisting portfolio of strong investor protections.\nTHE AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION IS A KEY determinant of the efficiency of resource\nallocation decisions in economies and their securities markets. There is, how-\never, considerable cross-country variation in the quality and quantity of cor-\nporate reporting, information intermediation, and information dissemination\nstructures (e.g., Bushman, Piotroski, and Smith (2004)). Hence an important\nresearch task is to understand why information infrastructures vary and what\nfactors determine their evolution over time.\nIn this paper, we focus on one element of information infrastructure, sell-\nside analysts. We exploit cross-country and intertemporal variation in analyst\nfollowing for 100 countries for the years 1987–2000 to test the hypothesis that\nanalyst following increases upon the restriction of insider trading.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the market’s reaction to U.K. insider transactions and ana-\nlyzes whether the reaction depends on the firm’s ownership. We present three major\nfindings. First, differences in regulation between the U.K. and United States, in par-\nticular the speedier reporting of trades in the U.K., may explain the observed larger\nabnormal returns in the U.K. Second, ownership by directors and outside sharehold-\ners has an impact on the abnormal returns. Third, it is important to adjust for news\nreleased before directors’ trades. In particular, trades preceded by news on mergers\nand acquisitions and CEO replacements contain significantly less information.\nINSIDERS, THAT IS , MANAGERS AND MEMBERS of the board of directors of publicly\ntraded corporations, usually possess more information about their company\nthan do (small) outside shareholders. The main argument in favor of insider\ntrading is that it communicates this superior information to outsiders. For in-\nstance, Leland (1992) shows that when insider trading is allowed, share prices\nincorporate more information, and are higher. However, while an insider pur-\nchase conveys positive information about the firm’s prospects, it is less clear\nwhat information an insider sale conveys. On the one hand, an insider sale may\nconvey unfavorable information about the firm’s prospects. On the other hand,\nan insider sale may be less informative if it is made to meet the liquidity needs\nof the seller.\nSeyhun (1986), Lin and Howe (1",

However, institutional \nallocation also contains private information about first-day IPO returns not re- \nflected in premarket demand and other public information. Our evidence supports \nbook-building theories of IPO underpricing, but suggests that institutional alloca- \ntion in underpriced issues is in excess of that explained by book-building alone. \nIT IS WELL KNOWN THAT initial public offerings (IPOs) are underpriced on av- \nerage. Underpricing is a robust phenomenon that extends across equity mar- \nkets in several countries and time periods (see, e.g., Loughran, Ritter, and \nRydqvist (1994)). For example, in our sample of IPOs offered during 1997- \n1998, the average day one return of issues is 19.25 percent.

In\n2017, the average institution gains an extra $129,000 in annual management fees if a\nstockholding increases 1% in value, considering both the direct effect on assets under\nmanagement and the indirect effect on subsequent fund ﬂows. The estimates range\nfrom $19,600 for investments in small ﬁrms to $307,600 for investments in large\nﬁrms. Institutional shareholders in one ﬁrm often gain when the ﬁrm’s competitors\ndo well, by virtue of institutions’ holdings in those ﬁrms, but the impact of common\nownership is modest in the most concentrated industries.\nTHIS PAPER STUDIES INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS ’ ﬁnancial incentives to be\nengaged shareholders. Institutional ownership of publicly traded U.S. ﬁrms\nrose from 32% to 73% of the overall market from 1980 to 2017, according to\n13F ﬁlings with the SEC, and the 100 largest institutions now own more than\n50% of all equity. This shift in ownership has the potential to substantially\naffect the governance of public ﬁrms if institutional investors have different\nincentives than other shareholders.\nInstitutions have traditionally been viewed as passive owners, raising con-\ncerns that their growth will weaken governance and exacerbate agency prob-\nlems (Bebchuk, Cohen, and Hirst ( 2017)).

These results suggest that the \ninstitutions serve a monitoring role in mitigating the agency problem between \nshareholders and managers.

Using both regression\nand portfolio tests, we ﬁnd that persistent institutional trading negatively predicts\nlong-term returns: persistently sold stocks outperform persistently bought stocks\nat long horizons.

Further analysis indicates that those \nmarkets lessen the impact of Fed policies on bank lending activity. The paper also \nexamines the role of internal capital markets in influencing the investment allo- \ncation process of those conglomerates. My findings suggest that frictions between \nconglomerate headquarters and external capital markets are at the root of invest- \nment inefficiencies generated by internal capital markets. \nCURRENT THEORETICAL RESEARCH HAS FOCUSED on the role of internal capital \nmarkets in influencing conglomerate investment. One line of argument, put \nforth by Alchian (1969) and Weston (1970), and extended by Gertner, Scharf- \nstein, and Stein (1994) and Stein (1997), stresses the potential efficiency- \nenhancing role of internal capital markets. These markets can be useful in \nreducing information asymmetries between project managers and investors, \nand in providing for better allocation of funds across projects within the \nfirm. A competing line of research, however, argues that internal capital \nmarkets can hinder investment efficiency. Scharfstein and Stein (2000) and \nRajan, Servaes, and Zingales (2000), among others, emphasize the potential \nfor agency probl",

    "abstract": "We study optimal financial contracting for centralized and decentralized firms. \nUnder centralized contracting, headquarters raises funds on behalf of multiple \nprojects. Under decentralized contracting, each project raises funds separately \non the external capital market. The benefit of centralization is that headquar- \nters can use excess liquidity from high cash-flow projects to buy continuation \nrights for low cash-flow projects. The cost is that headquarters may pool cash \nflows from several projects and self-finance follow-up investments without hav- \ning to return to the capital market. Absent any capital market discipline, it is \nmore difficult to force headquarters to make repayments, which tightens finan- \ncing constraints ex ante. Cross-sectionally, our model implies that conglomer- \nates should have a lower average productivity than stand-alone firms. \nBEGINNING WITH FAZZARI, HUBBARD, AND PETERSEN (1988), several studies document \nthat the investment behavior of firms is affected by financing constraints.1 In this \npaper, we explore the relation between financing constraints and organizational \nstructure. Specifically, we ask whether centralized firms where headquarters \nraises funds on behalf of multiple projects face tighter or looser financing con- \nstraints than stand-alone firms. \nThe internal capital markets literature provides some hints on the role of orga- \nnizational structure for financing constraints.

    "abstract": "When the discount rate falls, investment should rise. Thus with time-varying dis- \ncount rates and instantly changing investment, investment should positively co- \nvary with current stock returns and negatively covary with future stock returns. \nAggregate nonresidential U.S. investment contradicts both these implications, prob- \nably because of investment lags. Investment plans, however, satisfy both implica- \ntions. These investment plans, from a U.S. government survey of firms, are highly \ninformative measures of expected investment and explain more than three- \nquarters of the variation in real annual aggregate investment growth. Plans have \nsubstantial forecasting power for excess stock returns, showing that time-varying \nrisk premia affect investment. \nA BASIC IDEA IN ECONOMICS and finance is that when the discount rate falls, \ninvestment should rise. If discount rates move over time and investment \ninstantly adjusts, then the idea has two implications. First, investment and \nstock returns should positively covary over time. This positive contempora- \nneous covariation occurs because when discount rates fall, firms increase \ninvestment (since the hurdle rate on investment falls) and stock prices rise \n(since the discounted sum of future cash flows rises). Second, investment \nand future stock returns should negatively covary over time. This negative \ncovariation occurs because when discount rates are low, investment today is \nhigh and future expected returns are low. \nPos",

    "abstract": "A standard assumption of structural models of default is that ﬁrms’ assets evolve\nexogenously. In this paper, we examine the importance of accounting for investment\noptions in models of credit risk. In the presence of ﬁnancing and investment frictions,\nﬁrm-level variables that proxy for asset composition are signiﬁcant determinants of\ncredit spreads beyond leverage and asset volatility, because they capture the system-\natic risk of ﬁrms’ assets. Cross-sectional studies of credit spreads that fail to control\nfor the interdependence of leverage and investment decisions are unlikely to be very\ninformative. Such frictions also give rise to a realistic term structure of credit spreads\nin a production economy.\nQUANTITATIVE RESEARCH ON CORPORATEcredit risk has derived much of its intu-\nition from models in the tradition of Merton (1974) and Leland (1994). In these\nstructural models of credit risk, ﬁrms optimally choose to default when the\npresent value of coupon payments to bond holders is greater than the present\nvalue of future dividends.1 This optimality condition implies that leverage and\nasset volatility are key determinants of credit spreads.

Linking the central bank's forbearance \nto its alignment with domestic bank owners, it is shown that in equilibrium, \na regression toward the worst closure policy may result: The central banks of \ninitially less forbearing economies also adopt greater forbearance. \nI analyze the joint design of two bank regulatory mechanisms: minimum capital \nrequirements, which are an ex ante mechanism to prevent bank failures, and clo- \nsure policy, which is an ex post mechanism to manage the cost of bank failures. \nAt the heart of the paper is a simple but fundamental point: Ex post policies af- \nfect ex ante incentives, and, hence, the design of an ex ante mechanism must take \ninto account any feedback from the ex post policies.

The intertemporal consumption-based asset pricing model (e.g., \nRubinstein (1976), Lucas (1978), Breeden (1979), Harrison and Kreps (1979), \nCox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1985), Hansen and Jagannathan (1991)) predicts \nthat an asset's current price is equal to the expectation, conditioned on cur- \nrent information, of the product of the asset's payoff and a representative \nconsumer's intertemporal marginal rate of substitution (IMRS). While fun- \ndamental, this dominant paradigm for pricing assets has some well- \nrecognized shortcomings (see below), and there is clearly scope for alternative \n",

    "abstract": "Labor mobility is the ﬂexibility of workers to walk away from an industry in response\nto better opportunities. I develop a model in which labor ﬂows make bad times worse\nfor shareholders who are left with capital that is less productive. The model shows\nthat ﬁrms face greater operating leverage by providing ﬂexibility to mobile workers. I\nconstruct an empirical measure of labor mobility consistent with the model and docu-\nment an economically signiﬁcant cross-sectional relation between mobility, operating\nleverage, and stock returns. I ﬁnd that ﬁrms in mobile industries earn returns over\n5% higher than those in less mobile industries.\nFIRMS DO NOT OWN their most important production factor—labor—but merely\nrent it from willing individuals who have the ﬂexibility to leave. This paper\nstudies how the lack of full control over labor represents a source of risk for\nﬁrm owners. In particular, the paper addresses the following question: are\nﬁrms in industries employing workers whose labor skills are portable to other\nindustries more exposed to systematic risk than those in industries where\nworkers have less portable skills? The answer to this question is important for\na number of reasons. First, it offers insights on the source of a ﬁrm’s systematic\nrisk by linking workers’ decisions to asset price dynamics. Second, it sheds\nlight on why observable properties of the workforce employed in an industry\nshould explain cross-sectional differences in expected asset returns. Finally, it\nm",

    "abstract": "Our results highlight the importance of interaction among management, labor, and\ninvestors in shaping corporate governance. We find that strong union laws protect\nnot only workers but also underperforming managers. Weak investor protection com-\nbined with strong union laws are conducive to worker–management alliances, wherein\npoorly performing firms sell assets to prevent large-scale layoffs, garnering worker\nsupport to retain management. Asset sales in weak investor protection countries lead\nto further deteriorating performance, whereas in strong investor protection countries\nthey improve performance and lead to more layoffs.

    "abstract": "We ﬁnd that, in the early 20th century, counties in the United States where the\nagricultural elite had disproportionately large land holdings had signiﬁcantly fewer\nbanks per capita, even correcting for state-level effects. Moreover, credit appears to\nhave been costlier, and access to it more limited, in these counties. The evidence\nsuggests that elites may restrict ﬁnancial development in order to limit access to\nﬁnance, and they may be able to do so even in countries with well-developed political\ninstitutions.\nA RECENT LITERATURE EMPHASIZES the political economy underpinnings of eco-\nnomic underdevelopment. It notes that powerful constituencies, which arise,\nfor example, from the pattern of land holdings in a country, can drive the\ndevelopment of economic institutions, and growth more generally (see, e.g.,\nEngermann and Sokoloff (2002)). Banks are clearly important economic insti-\ntutions. While historians have argued that political forces have shaped banking\nsystems (see, e.g., Haber (2005a)), there has been little systematic examina-\ntion of the evidence. In this paper, we examine more systematically whether\nthe constituencies or interest groups that emerge in a country as a result of\nthe distribution of land holdings—often the earliest and most important form\nof wealth—can shape the development of the banking system.\n1\nThe precise channel through which constituencies or interest groups oper-\nate is also a matter of some debate.

Uncertainty about the predictive relation affects the optimal\nportfolio choice through dynamic learning, and leads to a state-dependent relation\nbetween the optimal portfolio choice and the investment horizon.

    "abstract": "This paper examines the role of legal investor protection for the efﬁciency of the\nmarket for corporate control when bidders are ﬁnancially constrained. In the model,\nstronger legal investor protection increases bidders’ outside funding capacity . How-\never, absent effective bidding competition, this does not improve efﬁciency , as the\nbid price, and thus bidders’ need for funds, increases one-for-one with the pledgeable\nincome. In contrast, under effective competition for the target, the increased outside\nfunding capacity improves efﬁciency by making it less likely that more efﬁcient but\nless wealthy bidders are outbid by less efﬁcient but wealthier rivals.\nBUILDING ON THE WORKof La Porta et al. (1997,1998), several empirical studies\nshow that countries with stronger legal investor protection allocate resources\nmore efﬁciently . For instance, Wurgler (2000) shows that these countries in-\ncrease investment more in growing industries, and decrease investment more\nin declining industries, compared to countries with weaker legal investor pro-\ntection. Similarly , McLean, Zhang, and Zhao (2012) show that ﬁrms in these\ncountries exhibit a higher sensitivity of investment to growth opportunities\nand consequently enjoy higher total factor productivity growth and higher\nproﬁtability .\nAn important resource allocation mechanism is the takeover market.

    "abstract": "We analyze the desirability of level playing fields in international financial regula-\ntion. In general, level playing fields impose the standards of the weakest regulator\nupon the best-regulated economies. However, they may be desirable when capital is\nmobile because they counter acherry-picking effect that lowers the size and efficiency\nof banks in weaker economies. Hence, while a laissez faire policy favors the better-\nregulated economy, level playing fields are good for weaker regulators. We show that\nmultinational banking mitigates the cherry-picking effect, and reduces the damage\nthat a level playing field causes in the better-regulated economy.\nAN IMPORTANT THEME IN RECENT DISCUSSIONS of financial regulation has been the\ndesirability of an internationally level playing field. For example, the desire to\nestablish a level playing field in bank capital requirements was one of the driv-\ning forces behind the 1988 Basel Accord, and the Basel Committee on Banking\nSupervision (1999, p. 10) remains committed to the principle of a level playing\nfield.

Compared with levered (stock) returns, unlevered market\nbeta plays a more important role in explaining the cross-section of unlevered equity\nreturns, even after controlling for size and BTM. The size effect is weakened, while the\nvalue premium and the volatility puzzle virtually disappear for unlevered returns.\nWe show that leverage induces heteroskedasticity in returns.

Financial integration widens the disconnect\nby beneﬁting stockholders but hurting nonstockholders. Survey data indicate that\ninternational risk sharing for stockholders is better than that for nonstockholders,\nconsistent with the predictions.\nINTERNATIONAL ASSET PRICES AND QUANTITIES are disconnected. In the\npost–Bretton Woods period, quarterly equity returns of the United States have\na correlation of 0.7 with those of the United Kingdom, whereas the corre-\nlation between the ﬁnancial income of the two countries is 0.14 and that of\nnondurable consumption growth is 0.18. This large spread between the cross-\ncountry equity correlation and consumption correlation is known as the inter-\nnational equity premium puzzle. Similarly , the correlation between the differ-\nences in home and foreign aggregate consumption growth rates (or consump-\ntion differentials) and real exchange rate changes is−0.06 between the United\nStates and United Kingdom, where",

    "abstract": "“Limits of Arbitrage” theories hypothesize that the marginal investor in a particular\nasset market is a specialized arbitrageur rather than a diversified representative\ninvestor. We examine the mortgage-backed securities (MBS) market in this light. We\nshow that the risk of homeowner prepayment, which is a wash in the aggregate, is\npriced in the MBS market. The covariance of prepayment risk with aggregate wealth\nimplies the wrong sign to match the observed prices of prepayment risk. The price of\nrisk is better explained by a kernel based on MBS market-wide specific risk, consistent\nwith the specialized arbitrageur hypothesis.\nA NUMBER OF RECENT “limits of arbitrage” theories predict that the distressed\nliquidation of assets by hedge funds results in a large drop in asset prices (see,\nfor example, Shleifer and Vishny (1997), Kyle and Xiong (2001), Gromb and\nVayanos (2002), Geanakoplos (2003), or He and Krishnamurthy (2006)). These\ntheories are often referenced in explaining episodes of market illiquidity and\nfalling asset prices, such as the events during the fall of 1998.\nIn traditional asset pricing theory, the marginal investor in every asset mar-\nket is the same broadly diversified representative investor. Thus, a hedge fund\nliquidating $200 billion of mortgage-backed securities finds a large pool of ready\nbuyers (comparable to the entire capital market), and the liquidation does not\naffect expected returns because the representative investor acts quickly to elim-\ninate exc",

This class is highly tractable with several distinct advantages: (i) ensures non-\nnegative interest rates, (ii) easily accommodates unspanned factors affecting volatility\nand risk premiums, and (iii) admits semi-analytical solutions to swaptions. A parsimo-\nnious model speciﬁcation within the linear-rational class has a very good ﬁt to both\ninterest rate swaps and swaptions since 1997 and captures many features of term\nstructure, volatility, and risk premium dynamics—including when interest rates are\nclose to the zero lower bound.\nTHE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT WITH VERY low interest rates creates difﬁculties for\nmany existing term structure models, most notably Gaussian or conditionally\nGaussian models that invariably place large probabilities on negative future\ninterest rates.

    "abstract": "This paper shows that the liquidation value of collateral depends on the interdepen-\ndency between borrower and collateral risk. Using transaction-level data on short-\nterm repurchase agreements (repo), we show that borrowers pay a premium of 1.1 to\n2.6 basis points when their default risk is positively correlated with the risk of the\ncollateral that they pledge. Moreover, we show that borrowers internalize this pre-\nmium when making their collateral choices. Loan-level credit registry data suggest\nthat the results extend to the corporate loan market as well.\nCOLLATERAL IS A KEY COMPONENT of a wide variety of loan contracts. It re-\nduces ﬁnancial constraints by increasing the borrower’s pledgeable income, as\nthe lender can liquidate the collateral in case of default. As such, a crucial\ndeterminant of loan pricing is the liquidation value of collateral, that is, the\nexpected value of the collateral conditional on borrower default. The higher\nthe liquidation value, the lower the rate charged by the lender.\nThe driver of liquidation value that receives most attention in the theo-\nretical and empirical literature is collateral redeployability (e.g., Williamson\n(1988), Benmelech, Garmaise, and Moskowitz (2005), Benmelech and Bergman\n(2009)).

Under\nautarky a limited amount of capital is sufficient to prevent risk-taking, but when fi-\nnancial markets are open capital becomes insufficient.

The reduced trading activity results in substantially higher trading costs: quoted\nand effective spreads are three to four times larger than during the trading day. The\nhigher spreads reflect greater adverse selection and order persistence, but not higher\ndealer profits. Because liquidity provision remains competitive after hours, the greater\nadverse selection and higher trading costs provide a direct measure of the magnitude\nof the liquidity externalities generated during the trading day.\nUNDERSTANDING NETWORK EFFECTS and liquidity externalities is one of the most\nimportant outstanding issues in market design (Madhavan (2000)) and mar-\nket regulation (Macey and O’Hara (1999)).

When heterogeneous assets trade under asymmetric information,\na quality effect emerges: high liquidity lowers the quality of the pool of sellers and\ndecreases future liquidity . Cyclical equilibria can arise even without fundamental\nshocks. In a cycle, investors speculate by bidding up the price of low-quality assets,\nanticipating a high resale price at the peak. When this resale effect is strong, cycles\ndisappear and multiple steady states coexist with different levels of liquidity . The\nmodel rationalizes empirical patterns for corporate bonds and housing in particular.\nASSET PRICES OFTEN APPEAR DISCONNECTED from fundamentals. This weak\nrelationship shows as excess price ﬂuctuations, documented notably for cor-\nporate bonds and housing by Bao and Pan (2013) and Glaeser et al. (2014).\nPrice deviations from fundamentals are sometimes extreme during speculative\nepisodes when prices rapidly increase before crashing (see Cutler, Poterba, and\nSummers 1991). In some asset classes, such as housing, the repeated nature\nof these episodes is puzzling. Why can price and trading volume ﬂuctuate so\nmuch in the absence of changes to fundamentals?\nThis paper proposes a theory of endogenous liquidity ﬂuctuations that can\nrationalize these phenomena.

In a regime-switching model in which the\ninvestment opportunity set varies over time, we explicitly characterize the optimal\nconsumption and investment strategy.

Arbitrageurs have constant relative risk-\naversion (CRRA) utility, while hedgers’ asset demand is independent of wealth. An\nincrease in hedgers’ risk aversion can make arbitrageurs endogenously more risk-\naverse. Because arbitrageurs generate endogenous risk, an increase in their wealth\nor a reduction in their CRRA coefﬁcient can raise risk premia despite Sharpe ratios de-\nclining. Arbitrageur wealth is a priced risk factor because assets held by arbitrageurs\noffer high expected returns but suffer the most when wealth drops. Aggregate illiq-\nuidity, which declines in wealth, captures that factor.\nLIQUIDITY IN FINANCIAL MARKETS IS OFTEN provided by specialized agents such as\nmarket makers, trading desks in investment banks, and hedge funds.

    "abstract": "Deviations from no-arbitrage relations should be related to market liquidity, because\nliquidity facilitates arbitrage. At the same time, a wide futures-cash basis may trig-\nger arbitrage trades and, in turn, affect liquidity. We test these ideas by studying the\ndynamic relation between stock market liquidity and the index futures basis. There\nis evidence of two-way Granger causality between the short-term absolute basis and\nliquidity, and liquidity Granger-causes longer-term absolute bases. Shocks to the ab-\nsolute basis predict future stock market liquidity. The evidence suggests that liquidity\nenhances the efficiency of the futures-cash pricing system.\nTHE LAW OF ONE PRICE is a fundamental building block of modern financial theory.\nIndeed, several well-known pricing relations in finance depend on the notion\nthat two traded or synthesized instruments with the same future cash flows\nshould trade at the same price. In practice, of course, market microstructure as-\npects may cause a temporary deviation of prices from their no-arbitrage values.\nFor example, extreme order imbalances in a cash market may create inventory\nproblems for market makers and cause temporary deviations of cash prices\nfrom the corresponding no-arbitrage prices implied by derivative markets.\nFinance scholars have long recognized that deviations from no-arbitrage re-\nlations are related to the frictions associated with transacting, in particular\nto (il)liquidity indicators such as the bid–ask spread.

    "abstract": "Employing a comprehensive database on transactions of commercial paper issued\nby domestic U.S. nonfinancial corporations, we study the determinants of very short-\nterm corporate yield spreads. We find that liquidity plays a role in the determination of\nspreads but, somewhat surprisingly, credit quality is the more important determinant\nof spreads, even at horizons of less than 1 month. These results are robust across a\nvariety of proxies for liquidity and credit risk, and have important implications for\nthe literature on the modeling of corporate bond prices.\nTHE SEMINAL PAPER BY MERTON (1974) PROVIDES a basic structural framework for\nvaluing defaultable corporate debt. One of the principal strengths of the Merton\napproach is that it makes clear causal links between the price of a firm’s debt\nand observables, thus providing specific testable predictions. However, the em-\npirical evidence for the model and various of its extensions is mixed. For ex-\nample, Sarig and Warga (1989) use a sample of long-term discount bonds to\ndemonstrate that yield spreads vary with maturity in a manner that is roughly\nconsistent with Merton’s model, but Helwege and Turner (1999) argue that\nthis result is an artifact of the method used to construct the corporate term\nstructures.\n1 Moreover, while direct tests of Merton-style models find that the\nmodels seriously underpredict the level of long-term corporate bond spreads\n(Jones, Mason, and Rosenfeld (1984), Ogden (1987), Collin-Dufresne, Goldstein,",

Using novel data to measure risk and return on marginal\nlending, I show that the profitability of lending does not decline and total borrower\ndebt increases during lending expansions, holding investment opportunities constant.\nOverall, financial shocks to constrained banks are found to have a quick, persistent,\nand amplified effect on the aggregate supply of credit.\nTHE QUESTION OF HOW FINANCING FRICTIONS in the banking sector affect lending\nbehavior and economic activity has long been of concern to the literature on\nfinancial institutions.

Firms headquartered in areas in which seniors constitute a\nlarge fraction of the population are more likely to pay dividends, initiate dividends,\nand have higher dividend yields.

Miller and Modigliani (1961) suggest that matching takes place between\ninvestor clienteles who demand dividends and those ﬁrms that ﬁnd it less costly\nto pay them, that is, companies set payout policy and investors sort based on\ntheir preferences for dividends. On the other hand, ﬁrms may actively respond\nto the preferences of their current shareholders. The empirical patterns will be\nthe same regardless of the direction of the underlying causal relation (payout\npolicies match investor preferences), but the implications for understanding\ncorporate policy are very different.

    "abstract": "Long-term reversals in U.S. stock returns are better explained as the rational reactions\nof investors to locked-in capital gains than an irrational overreaction to news. Predic-\ntors of returns based on the overreaction hypothesis have no power, while those that\nmeasure locked-in capital gains do, completely subsuming past returns measures that\nare traditionally used to predict long-term returns. In data from Hong Kong, where\ninvestment income is not taxed, reversals are nonexistent, and returns are not fore-\ncastable either by traditional measures or by measures based on the capital gains\nlock-in hypothesis that successfully predict U.S. returns.\nJEGADEESH AND TITMAN (1993) show that winner stocks over the past 6 months\noutperform losers by 1% per month during the next 6 to 12 months.

Using individual trading data, we show that the\ndisposition effect—the propensity to realize past gains more than past losses—applies\nonly to nondelegated assets like individual stocks; delegated assets, like mutual funds,\nexhibit a robust reverse-disposition effect. In an experiment, we show that increasing\ninvestors’ cognitive dissonance results in both a larger disposition effect in stocks\nand a larger reverse-disposition effect in funds.

Bootstrap simulations suggest that few funds produce\nbenchmark-adjusted expected returns sufﬁcient to cover their costs. If we add back\nthe costs in fund expense ratios, there is evidence of inferior and superior performance\n(nonzero trueα) in the extreme tails of the cross-section of mutual fundα estimates.\nTHERE IS A CONSTRAINT on the returns to active investing that we call equi-\nlibrium accounting. In short (details later), suppose that when returns are\nmeasured before costs (fees and other expenses), passive investors get passive\nreturns, that is, they have zeroα (abnormal expected return) relative to passive\nbenchmarks. This means active investment must also be a zero sum game—\naggregate α is zero before costs. Thus, if some active investors have positive\nα before costs, it is dollar for dollar at the expense of other active investors.\nAfter costs, that is, in terms of net returns to investors, active investment\nmust be a negative sum game.

Option grant practices were designed to provide lucky grants not only to\nexecutives but also to independent directors. Lucky grants to both CEOs and directors\nwere the product of deliberate choices, not of ﬁrms’ routines, and were timed to make\nthem more proﬁtable. Lucky grants are associated with higher CEO compensation\nfrom other sources, no majority of independent directors, no outside blockholder on\nthe compensation committee, and a long-serving CEO.\nTHE OPPORTUNISTIC TIMING of executives’ option grants—via backdating,\n“spring-loading” based on the use of inside information, or otherwise—has\nattracted a great deal of attention. The SEC and a small army of private law\nﬁrms hired by companies have investigated past grant practices.

Specifying utility as a nonhomothetic function of both luxury and basic\nconsumption goods, we derive pricing equations and evaluate the risk of holding eq-\nuity. Household survey and national accounts data mostly reflect basic consumption,\nand therefore overstate the risk aversion necessary to match the observed equity pre-\nmium. The risk aversion implied by the consumption of luxury goods is more than\nan order of magnitude less than that implied by national accounts data.

We propose a partial resolution to this equity\npremium puzzle by distinguishing between the consumption of basic goods and\nthat of luxury goods. Intuitively, rich households that hold most equity are al-\nmost satiated in their consumption of basic goods; wealth shocks are reflected\nin the consumption of luxury goods, which is much more responsive to stock\nreturns than the consumption of basic goods.\nSpecifically, we model utility as a function of the consumption of both a ba-\nsic good, of which a certain amount is requir",

    "abstract": "I build a dynamic capital structure model that demonstrates how business cycle vari-\nation in expected growth rates, economic uncertainty, and risk premia inﬂuences\nﬁrms’ ﬁnancing policies. Countercyclical ﬂuctuations in risk prices, default probabili-\nties, and default losses arise endogenously through ﬁrms’ responses to macroeconomic\nconditions. These comovements generate large credit risk premia for investment grade\nﬁrms, which helps address the credit spread puzzle and the under-leverage puzzle in\na uniﬁed framework. The model generates interesting dynamics for ﬁnancing and de-\nfaults, including market timing in debt issuance and credit contagion. It also provides\na novel procedure to estimate state-dependent default losses.\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH macroeconomic conditions are crucial for asset valu-\nation. Naturally, they should also have important implications for corporate\ndecisions. By introducing macroeconomic conditions into ﬁrms’ ﬁnancing de-\ncisions, this paper provides a risk-based explanation for two puzzles related\nto corporate debt. The ﬁrst puzzle is the credit spread puzzle, where yield\nspreads between investment grade corporate bonds and Treasuries are high\nand volatile relative to the observed default rates and recovery rates. The sec-\nond puzzle is the under-leverage puzzle, where ﬁrms choose low leverage ratios\ndespite facing seemingly large tax beneﬁts of debt and small costs of ﬁnancial\ndistress.\n∗Hui Chen is at the Sloan School of Management, Massachuse",

This trend,\nhowever, reverses over a 3-year horizon. Additionally, firms reducing discretionary\nexpenditures to beat forecasts have significantly greater equity issuances and insider\nselling in the following year, consistent with managers understanding the myopic na-\nture of their actions.

    "abstract": "This paper argues that the legacy potential of a ﬁrm’s strategy is an important deter-\nminant of CEO compensation, turnover, and strategy change. A legacy makes CEO\nreplacement expensive, because ﬁrm performance can only partially be attributed to\na newly employed manager. Boards may therefore optimally allow an incumbent to\nbe entrenched. Moreover, when a ﬁrm changes strategy it is optimal to change the\nCEO, because the incumbent has a vested interest in seeing the new strategy fail.\nEven though CEOs have no speciﬁc skills in our model, legacy issues can explain the\nempirical association between CEO and strategy change.\nTHIS PAPER PROPOSES A model of CEO replacement and puts forward a novel\ndeterminant for turnover decisions: the legacy potential of a ﬁrm’s strategy.\nWe mean by this the extent to which a manager’s decisions affect future ﬁrm\ncash ﬂows, potentially beyond the manager’s own tenure. The replacement of\na CEO is arguably one of the most important decisions a ﬁrm takes. Yet, the\ntheoretical and empirical ﬁnance literature has relatively little to say about the\nﬁrm and manager-speciﬁc characteristics that lead to one manager being ﬁred\nand replaced by another. As Brickley (2003) points out, the only variable that\npredicts turnover empirically is poor ﬁrm performance, but it has little pre-\ndictive power. Theoretical papers on managerial turnover tend to reduce CEO\nsuccessions to a sequence of static interactions (see below for more details). As\nsuch they do not dis",

    "abstract": "Using a large sample of litigation events involving publicly listed defendants, we\ndocument a surprising fact. The resolution of litigation through a court’s decision\ndominates settlement of litigation from the shareholders’ point of view, even when\nthe firm loses. We develop a model using agency costs within the firm to explain why\nthe market views settlement as a negative outcome on average and find empirical evi-\ndence supporting the implications of the model. Specifically, firms with weak corporate\ngovernance settle litigation more quickly, and the market reacts more negatively to\nsettlements involving firms with higher agency costs.\nPOLITICALLY, THERE ARE FEW ISSUES that are more contentiously debated than tort\nreform in the United States. The argument is usually framed from the per-\nspective of various opposing stakeholders in the process; proponents of reform\ncontend that the system is too often used frivolously to extort wealth from busi-\nness, while opponents of reform point out that it is the best means of protecting\nother stakeholders (customers, employees, neighboring communities, etc.) from\ndamages inflicted by the operations of business.

    "abstract": "We analyze a sample of 72 IPO firms that went public between 1992 and 1996 for \nwhich we have detailed proprietary information about the amount and cost of D&O \nliability insurance. If managers of IPO firms are exploiting superior inside infor- \nmation, we hypothesize that the amount of insurance coverage chosen will be re- \nlated to the post-offering performance of the issuing firm's shares. Consistent with \nthe hypothesis, we find a significant negative relation between the three-year post- \nIPO stock price performance and the insurance coverage purchased in conjunction \nwith the IPO. One plausible interpretation is that, like insider securities transac- \ntions, D&O insurance decisions reveal opportunistic behavior by managers. This \nprovides some motivation to argue that disclosure of the details of D&O insurance \ndecisions, as is required in some other countries, is valuable. \nCORPORATE INSIDERS ARE WIDELY ACKNOWLEDGED to possess superior information \nabout future prospects for the firms they manage, and to some degree to \nutilize that information to their private benefit.

Controlling for previously identified determinants\nof debt maturity and modeling leverage and debt maturity as jointly endogenous, we\ndocument a significant and robust inverse relation between managerial stock own-\nership and corporate debt maturity. We also show that managerial stock ownership\ninfluences the relation between credit quality and debt maturity and between growth\nopportunities and debt maturity.\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF LEVERAGE AND DEBT MATURITY STRUCTURE CHOICE in alleviat-\ning manager–shareholder agency conflicts is well recognized in the finance\nliterature. These vital decisions are at the discretion of top managers who\nare expected to make optimal (value-maximizing) financing choices on behalf\nof the shareholders. However, given the separation of ownership and control,\nmanagers cannot be expected to voluntarily choose the optimal debt maturity\nstructure or leverage and self-impose monitoring unless there is an incentive\nmechanism to align managerial and shareholder interests.

    "abstract": "How do shareholders perceive managers who lever up under a takeover threat? \nIncreasing leverage conveys good news if it reflects management's ability to en- \nhance value. It conveys bad news, though, if inefficient managers are more pres- \nsured to lever up than the efficient ones. This paper demonstrates that negative \nupdating may prevail. Managers who lever up to end a takeover threat may thus \ncommit to enhance value and yet increase their chances of being replaced by their \nshareholders. The model provides implications for the dispersion of intraindustry \nleverage and for the stock price reaction to debt-for-equity exchanges. \nRECENT EMPIRICAL RESEARCH ON CAPITAL STRUCTURE choice has documented a \nstrong link between corporate leverage and activity in the market for cor- \nporate control. Garvey and Hanka (1999), for example, show that smaller \ntakeover costs lead to higher leverage, while Berger, Ofek, and Yermack (1997) \nshow that the leverage of target firms increases in the aftermath of unsuc- \ncessful tender offers. One interpretation of these findings is that, in re- \nsponse to a takeover threat, managers lever up to commit to an increase in \nfirm value that preempts takeover gains (see Grossman and Hart (1982), \nJensen (1986), and Zwiebel (1996)).

    "abstract": "If management has high private benefits and a small equity stake, managers and\nworkers are natural allies against takeover threats. Two forces are at play. First,\nmanagers can transform employees into a “shark repellent” through long-term labor\ncontracts and thereby reduce the firm’s attractiveness to raiders. Second, employees\ncan act as “white squires” for the incumbent managers. To protect their high wages,\nthey resist hostile takeovers by refusing to sell their shares to the raider or by lobbying\nagainst the takeover. The model predicts that wages are inversely correlated with the\nmanagerial equity stake, and decline after takeovers.\nLABOR ECONOMISTS VIEW INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS as being shaped by the conflict\nbetween workers and management. Financial economists view corporate gov-\nernance as the outcome of the diverging interests of shareholders and manage-\nment. Actually, these two conflicts are present simultaneously and interact. We\nshow that the conflict in corporate governance, when particularly acute, can\nsoften the clash in industrial relations. Managers who place a great value on\ncontrol and own only a small equity stake have an incentive to pay high wages\nand not to monitor workers too strictly.

My results provide strong empirical support for the idea that the\nconstraints investors face may help explain the empirical failure of the capital asset\npricing model.\nONE OF THE FIRST AND MOST persistent anomalous ﬁndings in ﬁnance is that\nthe return difference between high-beta and low-beta stocks is signiﬁcantly\nsmaller than predicted by the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) of Sharpe\n(1964), Lintner ( 1965), and Mossin ( 1966).

Using the stock market as our setting, we ﬁnd that (i) stocks that are in eco-\nnomically related supplier and customer industries cross-predict each other’s returns,\n(ii) the magnitude of return cross-predictability declines with the number of informed\ninvestors in the market as proxied by the level of analyst coverage and institutional\nownership, and (iii) changes in the stock holdings of institutional investors mirror the\nmodel trading behavior of informed investors.\nA GROWING BODY OF EMPIRICALand theoretical research relaxes some of the strin-\ngent assumptions of the efﬁcient markets hypothesis, and posits that gradual\ndiffusion of information among investors explains the observed predictability\nof returns (Hong and Stein (1999)). To test the gradual diffusion of information\nhypothesis, the literature has focused mainly on studying the lagged price re-\nsponse of assets to their own past returns and their interaction with variables\nthought to affect the speed of information diffusion. This approach has been\nfollowed out of necessity because information ﬂow is a complex and unobserv-\nable process that is difﬁcult to measure directly as separate from an asset’s\nown past return.\nIn this paper, we explore a new channel of information ﬂow that is sepa-\nrate from an asset’s own past return, namely, delayed pr",

    "abstract": "We infer motives for trade initiation from market sidedness. We define trading as\nmore two-sided (one-sided) if the correlation between the number of buyer- and seller-\ninitiated trades increases (decreases), and assess changes in sidedness (relative to a\ncontrol sample) around events that identify trade initiators. Consistent with asym-\nmetric information, trading is more one-sided before merger news. Consistent with\nbelief heterogeneity, trading is more two-sided before earnings and macro announce-\nments with greater dispersion in analyst forecasts, and after news with larger an-\nnouncement surprises.

    "abstract": "We study how the creation of an internal capital market (ICM) can invite strategic\nresponses in product markets that, in turn, shape firm boundaries. ICMs provide\nex post resource flexibility, but come with ex ante commitment costs. Alternatively,\nstand-alones possess commitment ability but lack flexibility. By creating flexibility,\nintegration can sometimes deter a rival’s entry, but commitment problems can also\ninvite predatory capital raising. These forces drive different organizational equilibria\ndepending on the integrator’s relation to the product market. Hybrid organizational\nforms like strategic alliances can sometimes dominate integration by offering some of\nits benefits with fewer strategic costs.\nTHIS PAPER DEVELOPS A THEORY of the firm in which internal capital markets af-\nfect the ability to compete in product markets. In our model, a firm’s decision to\noperate an internal capital market affects the fund-raising behavior of its prod-\nuct market rivals. An internal capital market can either scare away rival firms\nor else induce them to compete more aggressively, raising more capital than\nthey otherwise would. In equilibrium, these strategic interactions determine\nthe boundaries of the firm.\nThere is substantial empirical evidence that internal capital markets impact\nfirms’ product market decisions.

    "abstract": "It is well known that firms are more likely to issue equity when their market values \nare high, relative to book and past market values, and to repurchase equity when \ntheir market values are low. We document that the resulting effects on capital \nstructure are very persistent. As a consequence, current capital structure is \nstrongly related to historical market values. The results suggest the theory that cap- \nital structure is the cumulative outcome of past attempts to time the equity market. \nIN CORPORATE FINANCE, \"equity market timing\" refers to the practice of issuing \nshares at high prices and repurchasing at low prices. The intention is to \nexploit temporary fluctuations in the cost of equity relative to the cost of \nother forms of capital. In the efficient and integrated capital markets stud- \nied by Modigliani and Miller (1958), the costs of different forms of capital do \nnot vary independently, so there is no gain from opportunistically switching \nbetween equity and debt. In capital markets that are inefficient or seg- \nmented, by contrast, market timing benefits ongoing shareholders at the \nexpense of entering and exiting ones. Managers thus have incentives to time \nthe market if they think it is possible and if they care more about ongoing \nshareholders. \nIn practice, equity market timing appears to be an important aspect of \nreal corporate financial policy.

    "abstract": "Does valuation affect mergers? Data suggest that periods of stock merger activity\nare correlated with high market valuations. The na ¨ıve explanation that overvalued\nbidders wish to use stock is incomplete because targets should not be eager to accept\nstock. However, we show that potential market value deviations from fundamental\nvalues on both sides of the transaction can rationally lead to a correlation between\nstock merger activity and market valuation. Merger waves and waves of cash and\nstock purchases can be rationally driven by periods of over- and undervaluation of the\nstock market. Thus, valuation fundamentally impacts mergers.\nONE OF THE PUZZLES IN FINANCE is why there are periods when mergers are plen-\ntiful and other periods when merger activity is much lower. For example, in\nthe period 1963–1964 there were 3,311 total acquisition announcements, while\nin 1968–1969 there were 10,569 acquisition announcements. Similarly in both\nthe period from 1979 to 1980 and from 1990 to 1991 there were approximately\n4,000 acquisition announcements while the late 1980s and late 1990s were\nmuch more active, with 9,278 announcements in 1999 alone (see Mergerstat\nReview 2001). These periods of high activity seem to be correlated with high\nmarket valuations, as shown by Maksimovic and Phillips (2001) and Jovanovic\nand Rousseau (2001).

We show that investors are compensated 7c/ in unrealized gains for each\ndollar of realized capital gains, that is, $1 of realized capital gains is equivalent to\n93c/ of unrealized gains. An investor with a tax rate on realized gains of 15% has an\neffective tax rate on unrealized capital gains of 8.6%.\nCAPITAL GAINS TAXES CAN BE DEFERRED UNTIL ASSETS ARE SOLD .

Using additional cross-sectional \npower gained from national stock index data of 18 countries during the period \n1969 to 1996, we find strong evidence of mean reversion in relative stock index \nprices. Our findings imply a significantly positive speed of reversion with a half- \nlife of three to three and one-half years. This result is robust to alternative spec- \nifications and data. Parametric contrarian investment strategies that fully exploit \nmean reversion across national indexes outperform buy-and-hold and standard con- \ntrarian strategies. \nMean reversion refers to a tendency of asset prices to return to a trend path. \nThe existence of mean reversion in stock prices is subject to much contro- \nversy.

Universities’ spending\ndecisions, pension plans’ ability to fund promised beneﬁts, and foundations’\nability to support charitable endeavors all depend crucially on the returns they\nreceive on their investments.

The aggregate LMI decreases from\n+$4 trillion precrisis to −$6 trillion in 2008. We conduct an LMI stress test revealing\nthe fragility of the banking system in early 2007.

The LMI is therefore informative about both individual bank\nliquidity and the liquidity risk of the entire banking system.\nLIQUIDITY PLAYS AN ENORMOUS ROLE in ﬁnancial crises.

We present\nmodel-based tests of this issue assuming runups are caused by signals that inform\ninvestors about potential takeover synergies. Rational deal anticipation implies a\nrelation between target runups and markups (offer value minus runup) that is greater\nthan minus one-for-one and inherently nonlinear. If merger negotiations force bidders\nto raise the offer with the runup—a costly feedback loop where bidders pay twice for\nanticipated target synergies—markups become strictly increasing in runups. Large-\nsample tests support rational deal anticipation in runups while rejecting the costly\nfeedback loop.\nTAKEOVER BIDS ARE TYPICALLY preceded by substantial target stock price runups.\nThe literature often characterizes such runups as the discounted value of target\ndeal synergies triggered by takeover rumors. As such, the runups are exogenous\nto the deal and should not affect deal terms. Yet, Schwert (1996) reports that,\nin a sample of takeovers, the market’s valuation of the offer itself is increasing\nin the runup, almost dollar for dollar. It is as if bidders increase the offer price\nby the runup, which would amount to paying twice for the target’s portion of\ndeal-speciﬁc synergies embedded in the runup.

To better under-\nstand the challenge in distinguishing investors’ beliefs from risk-adjusted discount-\ning, we use Perron–Frobenius Theory to isolate a positive martingale component\nof the stochastic discount factor process. This component recovers a probability mea-\nsure that absorbs long-term risk adjustments.

In our setting,\nrevealing leads to gaming, but secrecy can induce banks to underinvest in socially\ndesirable assets for fear of failing the test. We show that although the regulator can\nsolve this underinvestment problem by making the test easier, some disclosure may\nstill be optimal (e.g., if banks have high appetite for risk or if capital shortfalls are\nnot very costly). Cutoff rules are optimal within monotone disclosure rules, but more\ngenerally optimal disclosure is single-peaked. We discuss policy implications and offer\napplications beyond stress tests.\nFROM THE EARLY DAYS OF BANK stress tests in the wake of the 2008 ﬁnancial\ncrisis, disclosure has been a key subject of interest among practitioners,\nacademics, and regulators. Most of the academic discussion centers on public\ndisclosure of the test results (e.g., Goldstein and Sapra (2014), Goldstein and\nLeitner (2018)); whether regulators should disclose the models they use to\nforecast bank capital when conducting stress test has received less attention.\nThe latter question has recently gained momentum among policy makers and\npractitioners, however, leading to a change in the Federal Reserves’s policy .\nUnder the old policy , the Federal Reserve provided only a broad description of\nits stress test models.

    "abstract": "This paper examines model specification issues and estimates diffusive and jump risk\npremia using S&P futures option prices from 1987 to 2003. We first develop a time\nseries test to detect the presence of jumps in volatility, and find strong evidence in\nsupport of their presence. Next, using the cross section of option prices, we find strong\nevidence for jumps in prices and modest evidence for jumps in volatility based on\nmodel fit. The evidence points toward economically and statistically significant jump\nrisk premia, which are important for understanding option returns.\nTHERE ARE TWO CENTRAL , RELATED, issues in empirical option pricing. The first\nissue is model specification, which comprises identifying and modeling the fac-\ntors that jointly determine returns and option prices. Recent empirical work\non index options identifies factors such as stochastic volatility, jumps in prices,\nand jumps in volatility. The second issue is quantifying the risk premia associ-\nated with the jump and diffusive factors using a model that passes reasonable\nspecification hurdles.\nThe results in the literature regarding these issues are mixed. For exam-\nple, tests using option data disagree over the importance of jumps in prices:\nBakshi, Cao, and Chen (1997) (BCC) find substantial benefits from including\njumps in prices, whereas Bates (2000) and others find that such benefits are\neconomically small, if not negligible.\n1 Furthermore, while studies using the\ntime series of returns unanimously s",

In addition, momentum profits around the world are economically \nlarge and statistically reliable in both good and bad economic states. Further, \nthese momentum profits reverse over 1- to 5 -year horizons, an action inconsis- \ntent with existing risk-based explanations of momentum. \nThe phenomenon of momentum, continuation of the direction of prior stock re- \nturns, has proved to be a challenge to financial economists.

Institutions act as mo- \nmentum traders when they enter stocks but as contrarian traders when they exit \nor make adjustments to ongoing holdings.

We develop a two-stage\napproach and apply it to the Chinese economy with a conﬁdential loan-level data set\nthat covers all sectors.

    "abstract": "We present a new model of investors delegating portfolio management to professionals\nbased on trust. Trust in the manager reduces an investor’s perception of the riskiness\nof a given investment, and allows managers to charge fees. Money managers compete\nfor investor funds by setting fees, but because of trust, fees do not fall to costs. In\nequilibrium, fees are higher for assets with higher expected return, managers on\naverage underperform the market net of fees, but investors nevertheless prefer to\nhire managers to investing on their own.

Using unique, detailed data on boards’ information sets and\ndecisions for a large sample of private equity–backed ﬁrms, we ﬁnd that gathering\ninformation helps boards learn about CEO ability. “Soft” information plays a much\nlarger role than hard data, such as the performance metrics that prior literature fo-\ncuses on, and helps avoid ﬁring a CEO for bad luck or in response to adverse external\nshocks. We show that governance reforms increase the effectiveness of board mon-\nitoring and establish a causal link between forced CEO turnover and performance\nimprovements.\nBOARDS OF DIRECTORS ARE tasked with ensuring that ﬁrms are run by compe-\ntent managers who act in their shareholders’ interest. This involves not only\nthe provision of appropriate incentives but also what Tirole (2001) calls active\nmonitoring. An active monitor collects information about the ﬁrm’s operations\nor the manager’s ability and—in contrast to a passive monitor such as a ﬁnan-\ncial analyst, rating agency, or the media—is in a position to ﬁre the manager\nif he believes ﬁrm value is not being maximized. As monitoring beneﬁts all\ninvestors while being privately costly to provide, directors are more likely to\nengage in monitoring if they have skin in the game.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a theory of optimal debt structure when the moral hazard \nproblem is severe. The main idea is that the optimal debt contract delegates mon- \nitoring to a single senior lender and that seniority allows the monitoring senior \nlender to appropriate the full return from his monitoring activities. The theory \nexplains (i) why debt contracts are prioritized, (ii) why short-term debt is senior \nto long-term debt, and (iii) why financial intermediaries usually hold short-term \nsenior debt whereas long-term junior debt is widely held. Another implication of \nthe theory is that covenant and maturity structures will be set to conform to the \nseniority structure. \nWhen a firm becomes highly leveraged, its debt contracts are often priori- \ntized into several classes, so that, in the event of bankruptcy liquidation, \nsome lenders will have claims on the firm's assets before others do. The most \ncommon financing pattern consists of senior bank debt with public debt sub- \nordinate to it. Another common characteristic is that senior bank debt usu- \nally has a shorter maturity and a more restrictive set of covenants than \njunior public debt.' \nWhen we consider banks as delegated monitors who specialize in infor- \nmation gathering, it seems puzzling that banks are usually senior. If, as has \nbeen argued (Fama (1990)), junior lenders have stronger incentives than \nsenior lenders to monitor default risks, then we would expect monitoring \nspecialists such as banks to be junior,",

    "abstract": "Brennan and Franks (1997) and Stoughton and Zechner (1998) provide contrast-\ning arguments for why monitoring considerations create incentives for managers to\nunderprice their firms’ IPOs (initial public offerings). Like Smart and Zutter\n(2003), we examine these arguments using a sample of U.S. IPOs. However, we find\nevidence that the determinants of initial returns, institutional shareholdings, and\npost-IPO likelihood of acquisition are not consistent with these arguments. Thus,\nwe conclude that monitoring considerations are not important determinants of IPO\nunderpricing.\nEVIDENCE THAT THE PRICES OF UNSEASONED NEW ISSUES of common stock (IPOs) in\nearly secondary market trading are substantially higher, on average, than their\noffer prices has evoked an extensive literature trying to explain such under-\npricing. While prior literature has tended to focus on uncertainty/asymmetric\ninformation stories for such underpricing (e.g., Rock (1986) and Benveniste and\nSpindt (1989)), recent literature has suggested that post-IPO ownership con-\nsiderations are also important. More specifically, this literature has suggested\nthat monitoring considerations create incentives for managers to underprice\ntheir firm’s stock in its first public offering.\nBrennan and Franks (1997), for example, argue that insiders have an in-\ncentive to underprice the IPO of their firm’s stock in order to ensure its wide\ndistribution, thereby reducing the likelihood of being monitored or removed by\nnew shareholde",

    "abstract": "Banks and related financial institutions often have two separate subsidiaries that\nmake loans of similar type but differing risk, for example, a bank and a finance com-\npany, or a “good bank/bad bank” structure. Such “bipartite” structures may prevent\nrisk shifting, in which banks misuse their flexibility in choosing and monitoring loans\nto exploit their debt holders. By “insulating” safer loans from riskier loans, a bipartite\nstructure reduces risk-shifting incentives in the safer subsidiary. Bipartite structures\nare more likely to dominate unitary structures as the downside from riskier loans is\nhigher or as expected profits from the efficient loan mix are lower.\nAT FIRST GLANCE , SOME SUBSIDIARY STRUCTURES that are common among financial\ninstitutions seem difficult to explain. For example, bank holding companies,\nsuch as Wells Fargo Inc. and Bank of America, often have both a commercial\nbanking subsidiary and a finance company subsidiary. Both subsidiaries make\nloans, and the sectors to which they lend usually overlap: both may lend to\nconsumers, or both may lend to commercial firms. On average, finance com-\npany loans are more risky than commercial bank loans, but outside investors\ngenerally cannot observe the risk of any given loan at the time it is made.

I use three distinct, comple-\nmentary approaches to decompose municipal bond spreads into default and liquidity\ncomponents, and ﬁnd that default risk accounts for 74% to 84% of the average spread\nafter adjusting for tax-exempt status. The ﬁrst approach estimates the liquidity com-\nponent using transaction data, the second measures the default component with credit\ndefault swap data, and the third is a quasi-natural experiment that estimates changes\nin default risk around pre-refunding events. The price of default risk is high given\nthe rare incidence of municipal default and implies a high risk premium.\nSINCE THE FINANCIAL CRISIS, the poor condition of local government ﬁnances has\ncaptured the attention of academics, legislators, and the popular press. Ris-\ning retirement and healthcare costs are straining state and local government\nbudgets. The post-crisis spate of defaults by cities and counties, including the\nbankruptcy ﬁling by Detroit in 2013, represents the most signiﬁcant default\nepisode in the municipal bond market since the Great Depression.1 Based on\nrecent events, it seems that municipal default risk is on the rise. However,\na longer view reveals that defaults are extremely rare in the municipal bond\nmarket. The historical ﬁve-year cumulative default rate for all municipal bonds\nis 0.08% from 1970 to 2014, and the corresponding rate for general obligation\nbonds is 0.01% (Moody’s (2015)).\nThe academic literature on",

    "title": "Municipal Debt and Marginal Tax Rates: Is There a Tax Premium in Asset Prices?",
    "abstract": "We study the marginal tax rate incorporated into short-term municipal rates using\nmunicipal swap market data. Using an afﬁne model, we identify the marginal tax\nrate and the credit/liquidity spread in 1-week tax-exempt rates, as well as their\nassociated risk premia. The marginal tax rate averages 38.0% and is related to stock,\nbond, and commodity returns. The tax risk premium is negative, consistent with\nthe strong countercyclical nature of after-tax ﬁxed-income cash ﬂows. These results\ndemonstrate that tax risk is a systematic asset pricing factor and help resolve the\nmuni-bond puzzle.\nONE OF THE MOST FUNDAMENTALissues in ﬁnancial economics is the question of\nhow taxes affect security values. This important topic has been the focus of an\nextensive literature that now dates back nearly a century. Despite the many\nimportant contributions in this area, however, there is still much about the\neffects of taxation on investment values that is not yet fully understood.\nThe challenge is particularly evident in studying municipal debt markets.\nMany researchers document that the ratio of municipal bond yields to Treasury\nor corporate bond yields appears to imply marginal tax rates that are much\nsmaller than would be expected given federal income tax rates. This perplexing\nrelation between taxable and tax-exempt yields is often termed the muni-bond\npuzzle.\n1\nThis paper presents a new and fundamentally different approach to esti-\nmating the marginal tax rateτt incorporated into tax-exemp",

    "title": "New Evidence of the Impact of Dividend Taxation and on the Identity of the Marginal Investor",
    "abstract": "This paper examines the impact of a major change in dividend taxation introduced \nin the United Kingdom in July 1997. The reform was structured in such a way that \nthe immediate impact fell almost entirely on the largest investor class in the United \nKingdom, namely pension funds. We find significant changes in the valuation of \ndividend income after the reform, in particular for high-yielding companies. These \nresults provide strong support for the hypothesis that taxation affects the valua- \ntion of companies, and that pension funds were the effective marginal investors for \nhigh-yielding companies. \nIT IS VERY RARE FOR GOVERNMENTS to design their tax changes in a way that \nallows clean tests of important hypotheses. However, in July 1997, the in- \ncoming Labour government in the United Kingdom radically reformed the \ntaxation of dividend income in such a way that the immediate impact fell \nalmost entirely upon one important class of investors, namely pension funds. \nAs is well known, pension funds are the single biggest class of investors in \nU.K. equities. It was estimated, in 1997, that over one third of U.K. equities \nwere held by pension funds, and the impact of the tax change was to in- \ncrease the taxation of dividend income by ?5bn ($7.5 bn) per annum. We use \nthis major tax change to examine two questions: Is there evidence that pen- \nsion funds are the \"marginal\" investors in the United Kingdom, and, if so, \nhow do taxes affect the valuation of dividend income? \nG",

    "abstract": "If arbitrage is costly and noise traders are active, asset prices may deviate from \nfundamental values for long periods of time. We use a sample of 158 closed-end \nfunds to show that noise-trader sentiment, as proxied by retail-investor flows, leads \nto fluctuations in the discount. Nevertheless, we reject the hypothesis that noise- \ntrader risk is the cause of the long-run discount. Instead we find that funds which \nare more difficult to arbitrage have larger discounts, due to: (1) the censoring of \nthe discount by the arbitrage bounds, and (2) the freedom of managers to increase \ncharges when arbitrage is costly. \nDELONG ET AL. (1990) DESCRIBE a market as a contest between arbitrageurs, \nwhose expectations are rational, and noise traders, whose expectations are \nbased on sentiment. Not only does an arbitrageur have to manage the fun- \ndamental risk on a position, but he or she also bears \"the risk that noise \ntraders' beliefs will not revert to their mean for a long time and might in the \nmeantime become even more extreme\" (DeLong et al., p. 704). The result is \nthat the price of an asset may fluctuate in a band around fundamental value, \nthe width of the band depending on the cost of arbitrage and the number of \nnoise traders.

Our noise measure captures episodes of\nliquidity crises of different origins across the ﬁnancial market, providing information\nbeyond existing liquidity proxies. Moreover, as a priced risk factor, it helps to explain\ncross-sectional returns on hedge funds and currency carry trades, both known to be\nsensitive to the general liquidity conditions of the market.\nTHE LEVEL OF LIQUIDITY in the aggregate ﬁnancial market is closely connected to\nthe amount of arbitrage capital available. During normal times, institutional\ninvestors such as investment banks and hedge funds have abundant capital,\nwhich they can deploy to supply liquidity. Consequently, big price deviations\nfrom fundamental values are largely eliminated by arbitrage forces, and assets\nare traded at prices closer to their fundamental values. During market crises,\nhowever, capital becomes scarce and/or willingness to deploy it diminishes,\nand liquidity in the overall market dries up.

    "abstract": "Records of over half a million participants in more than 600 401(k) plans indicate that\nparticipants tend to allocate their contributions evenly across the funds they use, with\nthe tendency weakening with the number of funds used. The number of funds used,\ntypically between three and four, is not sensitive to the number of funds offered by the\nplans, which ranges from 4 to 59. A participant’s propensity to allocate contributions\nto equity funds is not very sensitive to the fraction of equity funds among offered\nfunds. The paper also comments on limitations on inferences from experiments and\naggregate-level data analysis.\nHOW MUCH AND HOW TO SAVE FOR RETIREMENT is one of the most important financial\ndecisions made by most people. Defined contribution (DC) pension plans, such\nas the popular 401(k) plans, are important instruments of such savings. By 2001\nyear-end, about 45 million American employees held 401(k) plan accounts with\na total of $1.75 trillion in assets (Holden and VanDerhei (2001)). An important\ncharacteristic of these plans is that the participant has responsibility over his\nsavings among a plan’s various funds. How responsibly do the participants be-\nhave? In particular, how sensitive are participants’ choices to possible framing\neffects associated with the menu of choices they are offered?\nTo explore these questions, this paper analyzes a data set recently provided\nby the Vanguard Group consisting of records of more than half a million par-\nticipants in about 64",

We find issuers, particularly noninvestment-\ngrade issuers for whom informational economies of scope are likely to be large, benefit\nthrough lower underwriter fees and discounted loan yield spreads. Underwriters, both\ncommercial banks as well as investment banks, engage in concurrent lending and\nprovide price discounts, albeit in different ways. We find concurrent lending helps\nunderwriters build relationships, increasing the probability of receiving current and\nfuture business.\nFOR MANY YEARS, THE 1933 GLASS-STEAGALL ACT prevented commercial banks from\nunderwriting corporate bonds and equities. Due to the relaxation and recent\nrepeal of the Act, many commercial banks have acquired investment banks or\ndeveloped investment banking capabilities internally to create universal banks\nthat can offer an array of financial services.\nThe entry of commercial banks into underwriting markets has increased the\npotential for financial institutions to offer both lending and underwriting ser-\nvices.

In a large sample of funds, we ﬁnd substantial\nevidence that hedge fund risk exposures vary across and within months, and that\ncapturing within-month variation is more important for hedge funds than for mutual\nfunds. We consider different within-month functional forms, and uncover patterns\nsuch as day-of-the-month variation in risk exposures.

Static analyses of\nhedge funds’ risk exposures are likely to miss these rapid changes in their\nstrategies or leverage ratios, and thus several new approaches have been pro-\nposed to model the dynamics of these risk exposures.1 One factor that must\nbe taken into consideration is the high frequency (often daily or even higher)\nwith which hedge fund risk exposures change.2 However, the approaches pro-\nposed thus far to model dynamic risk exposures track such changes only at the\nmonthly frequency, as this is the reporting frequency for performance data in\nall of the main hedge fund databases.\nWe propose a new method to surmount this obstacle, and to better understand\nthe high-frequency dynamics of hedge fund risk exposures.

We find statistically and eco-\nnomically significant predictability in the time series when payout (dividends plus\nrepurchases) and net payout (dividends plus repurchases minus issuances) yields are\nused instead of the dividend yield. Similarly, we find that payout (net payout) yields\ncontains information about the cross section of expected stock returns exceeding that\nof dividend yields, and that the high minus low payout yield portfolio is a priced factor.\nWHILE THE IRRELEVANCE THEOREM of Miller and Modigliani (1961) implies that\nthere is no reason to suspect that dividends play a role in determining equity\nprice levels or equity returns, the theorem is silent on the usefulness of div-\nidends in explaining these variables. It is then, perhaps, not surprising that\nthere is a considerable literature exploiting the properties of dividends and\ndividend yields to better understand the fundamentals of asset pricing both\nin the time series and in the cross section.

We demonstrate\nthe problem in a specific context, the exchange of open-end mutual fund shares.\nMutual funds typically set fund share price ~NAV! using an algorithm that fails to\naccount for nonsynchronous trading in the fund’s underlying securities. This re-\nsults in predictable changes in NAV, which lead to exploitable trading opportuni-\nties. A modification to the pricing algorithm that corrects for nonsynchronous trading\neliminates much of the predictability. However, there are many other potential\nsources of distortion when intermediaries set prices.\nTHE EXCHANGE OF FINANCIAL SECURITIES usually involves an intermediary. In\nmany cases the intermediary acts merely as an administrative conduit, with\nthe terms of trade set by the transacting principals. There are, however,\nimportant instances where the intermediary sets the terms at which one or\nboth principals commits to trade.

    "abstract": "We integrate an agency problem into search theory to study executive compensation\nin a market equilibrium. A CEO can choose to stay or quit and search after privately\nobserving an idiosyncratic shock to the ﬁrm. The market equilibrium endogenizes\nCEOs’ and ﬁrms’ outside options and captures contracting externalities. We show\nthat the optimal pay-to-performance ratio is less than one even when the CEO is risk\nneutral. Moreover, the equilibrium pay-to-performance sensitivity depends positively\non a ﬁrm’s idiosyncratic risk and negatively on the systematic risk. Our empirical\ntests using executive compensation data conﬁrm these results.\nTWO QUESTIONS CONCERNING EXECUTIVEcompensation deserve particular atten-\ntion. The ﬁrst is: how does a ﬁrm’s risk affect CEO’s pay-to-performance sensi-\ntivity (hereafter PPS), that is, the ratio of incentive pay to ﬁrm performance?\nStandard agency models predict that PPS does not change with ﬁrm risk if the\nagent is risk neutral and decreases with ﬁrm risk if the agent is risk averse.\nNotable examples are Bolton and Dewatripont (2005, pp. 160–162), Holm-\nstrom (1982), and Murphy (1999, pp. 27–28). In contrast to this theoretical\nprediction, however, the empirical evidence on the effect of ﬁrm risk on PPS is\nmixed.

Using FTSE\n100 and S&P 500 options, and both power and exponential-utility functions, we esti-\nmate the representative agent’s relative risk aversion (RRA) at different horizons. The\nestimated coefficients of RRA are all reasonable. The RRA estimates are remarkably\nconsistent across utility functions and across markets for given horizons.

Using intraday options data from the\npeak of the Internet bubble, we find almost no evidence that synthetic stock prices\ndiverged from actual stock prices. We also show that the general public could cheaply\nshort synthetically using options. In summary, we find no evidence that short-sale\nrestrictions affected Internet stock prices.\nPRICES OF NASDAQ-LISTED TECHNOLOGY STOCKS rose dramatically in the late 1990s,\npeaked in March 2000, and then lost more than two thirds of their value over the\nnext two years.

When OOT investors buy 10% of\nthe housing in the city center and 5% in the suburbs, welfare among residents falls\nby 0.61% in consumption-equivalent units.

For example, the United\nStates attracted $153 billion in foreign residential real estate investment be-\ntween April 2016 and March 2017, accounting for 10% of all purchases. These\ninvestment ﬂows are controversial as they tend to leave highly desirable real\nestate underutilized and are thought to push up the cost of housing for local\nresidents, fueling the affordability issues these cities already struggle with.\nPublic opposition to OOT investor ﬂows has led many large cities to tax res-\nidential property purchases by nonresidents.

We hypothesize that contrac-\ntual externalities due to ﬁrm boundaries make it difﬁcult to extract performance from\nan outsourced relationship. Consistent with this view, outsourced funds face higher\npowered incentives; they are more likely to be closed after poor performance and\nexcessive risk-taking.\nOVER THE MOST RECENTdecades, open-end mutual funds have been among the\nfastest growing types of institutions in this country.

We attribute this result to preferential treatment of in-house funds via the\npreferential allocation of IPOs, trading opportunities, and cross-trades, especially\nat times when in-house funds face steep outﬂows and require liquidity. We explain\npreferential treatment with agency problems: it increases with the subcontractor’s\nmarket power and the difﬁculty of monitoring the subcontractor, and decreases with\nthe subcontractor’s amount of parallel in-house activity.\nTHE COMPLEXITY OF INVESTMENT DECISIONSand the need for specialized informa-\ntion makes the outsourcing of portfolio management an important dimension\nof the ﬁnancial services industry.

    "abstract": "We present a simple rational model to highlight the effect of investors’ participation\ncosts on the response of mutual fund flows to past fund performance. By incorporat-\ning participation costs into a model in which investors learn about managers’ ability\nfrom past returns, we show that mutual funds with lower participation costs have a\nhigher flow sensitivity to medium performance and a lower flow sensitivity to high\nperformance than their higher-cost peers. Using various fund characteristics as prox-\nies for the reduction in participation costs, we provide empirical evidence supporting\nthe model’s implications for the asymmetric flow-performance relationship.\nMANY RESEARCHERS DOCUMENT AN asymmetric relationship between mutual fund\nflows and past performance: Funds with superior recent performance enjoy\ndisproportionately large new money inflows, while funds with poor performance\nsuffer smaller outflows.\n1 Moreover, fund characteristics such as age, volatility of\npast performance, affiliation with a large or “star”-producing fund complex, and\nmarketing expenditures affect both the level of fund flows and the sensitivity of\nflows to past performance.\n2 In this paper, we develop a rational model to explain\nsimultaneously the asymmetric response of fund flows to past performance and\n∗Huang is at the McCombs School of Business, University of Texas at Austin.

    "abstract": "Firms differ in the extent to which they \"pass through\" changes in exchange rates \ninto foreign currency prices and in their \"exposure\" to exchange rates-the respon- \nsiveness of their profits to changes in exchange rates. Because pricing affects prof- \nitability, a firm's pass-through and exposure should be related. This paper develops \nmodels of exporting firms under imperfect competition to study these related phe- \nnomena. From these models we derive the optimal pass-through decisions and the \nresulting exchange rate exposure. The models are estimated on eight Japanese ex- \nport industries using both the price data pass-through and financial data for exposure. \nEXCHANGE RATES CAN HAVE A MAJOR influence on the pricing behavior and prof- \nitability of exporting and importing firms. Firms differ in the extent to which \nthey \"pass through\" the change in exchange rates into the prices they charge \nin foreign markets. They also differ in their \"exposure\" to exchange rates- \nthe responsiveness of their profits to changes in exchange rates. Previous \npapers have studied either pass-through or exposure, but none has studied \nthese two phenomena together. Yet, because pricing directly affects profit- \nability, the exposure of a firm's profits to exchange rates should be governed \nby many of the same firm and industry characteristics that determine pric- \ning behavior.

We initiate this research by studying CEO pension ar-\nrangements in 237 large capitalization firms. Among our findings are that CEO com-\npensation exhibits a balance between debt and equity incentives; the balance shifts\nsystematically away from equity and toward debt as CEOs grow older; annual in-\ncreases in pension entitlements represent about 10% of overall CEO compensation,\nand about 13% for CEOs aged 61–65; CEOs with high debt incentives manage their\nfirms conservatively; and pension compensation influences patterns of CEO turnover\nand cash compensation.\nIN THE THREE DECADES SINCE THE PUBLICATION of Jensen and Meckling (1976), a\nvast academic literature has emerged on executive compensation. This liter-\nature focuses predominantly on equity-based compensation, paid in the form\nof restricted stock, stock options, and other instruments whose value is tied to\nfuture equity returns. Empirically, the growing role of equity-based compensa-\ntion is widely documented in the research examining pay versus performance.\nOn the theoretical front, the literature seeks to identify both a justification for\nlinking managerial pay to equity and the potential consequences of such a link\nfor managerial incentives and other issues.\nImplicit in virtually all of this research is the assumption that managerial\ncompensation consists of only two components, namely, cash and equity-linked\ni",

Settling bank claims across zones in-\ncurs a cost. In equilibrium, a liquidity externality arises when zones are sufﬁciently\ndifferent in their outsourcing propensities—a bank may restrict its own lending be-\ncause it needs to hold liquidity against claims issued by another bank. Our work\nhighlights that the disparate motives for interbank borrowing (investing in produc-\ntive projects and managing liquidity) can have different effects on efﬁciency .\nTHERE ARE LARGE PAYMENT FLOWS between banks. For example, in 2017,\nthe Federal funds market had an average daily volume of $75 to $100 billion.\nSimilarly , the Clearing House Interbank Payments System, the largest private\nclearing house in the United States, processes transfers of $1.5 trillion per\nday .1 In this paper, we ask: what is the role of banks in the payment system,\nand how does this role affect their lending function?\nTo address these questions, we construct a stylized model with three impor-\ntant elements. First, banks process payments that generate interbank obliga-\ntions. As in practice, claims issued on accounts at one bank may be deposited\nand withdrawn at another bank.

These companies earn lower stock returns than firms with\nhealthier pension plans for at least 5 years after the first emergence of the underfund-\ning. The low returns are not explained by risk, price momentum, earnings momentum,\nor accruals. Further, the evidence suggests that investors do not anticipate the impact\nof the pension liability on future earnings, and they are surprised when the nega-\ntive implications of underfunding ultimately materialize. Finally, underfunded firms\nhave poor operating performance, and they earn low returns, although they are value\ncompanies.\nTHE COMBINATION OF A DEEP BEAR STOCK MARKET and a sharp fall in interest rates\nduring the period 2000 to 2002 has resulted in a $400 billion deterioration of the\nfunding status of defined benefit (DB) pension plans in the United States. The\ngravity of this phenomenon is such that the research divisions of several invest-\nment firms started the calendar year 2003 with a report on corporate pension\nfunding and accounting. As one might expect, the main theme of these reports\nis whether or not current market valuations correctly reflect this liability and\nits implications for future corporate cash flows.\n1\nThe correct valuation of the corporate pension liability does not concern\nonly stock market efficiency; indeed it has macroeconomic implications.

For CEOs, incen- \ntives are $5.65 higher than for divisional executives. Incentives for the median \ntop management team are substantial at $32.32.

    "abstract": "We analyze the likelihood of government bailouts of 450 politically connected firms\nfrom 35 countries during 1997–2002. Politically connected firms are significantly more\nlikely to be bailed out than similar nonconnected firms. Additionally, politically con-\nnected firms are disproportionately more likely to be bailed out when the International\nMonetary Fund or the World Bank provides financial assistance to the firm’s home\ngovernment. Further, among bailed-out firms, those that are politically connected ex-\nhibit significantly worse financial performance than their nonconnected peers at the\ntime of and following the bailout. This evidence suggests that, at least in some coun-\ntries, political connections influence the allocation of capital through the mechanism\nof financial assistance when connected companies confront economic distress.\nANECDOTAL EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT , at least in some countries, politically con-\nnected firms have preferential access to debt financing. 1 Empirical evidence\nsupports the anecdotal evidence: Chiu and Joh (2004), Cull and Xu (2005),\nFaccio (2003), Johnson and Mitton (2003), and Khwaja and Mian (2005) show\nthat politically connected (but publicly traded) firms have higher leverage ra-\ntios than their nonconnected peers.

    "abstract": "Using cross-sectional data from the SCF and Tax Model, we show that entrepre- \nneurial income risk has a significant influence on portfolio choice and asset prices. \nWe find that households with high and variable business income hold less wealth \nin stocks than other similarly wealthy households, although they constitute a sig- \nnificant fraction of the stockholding population. Similarly for nonentrepreneurs, \nholding stock in the firm where one works reduces the portfolio share of other \ncommon stocks. Finally, we show that adding proprietary income to a linear asset \npricing model improves its performance over a similar model that includes only \nwage income. \nIN CONSTRUCTING INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS, it appears that many if not most house- \nholds fail to behave in a manner consistent with simple economic theory. \nEven among relatively wealthy households, the share of financial assets held \nin different asset classes varies widely, and there is evidence that among \nthose who hold common stock, there is often little diversification (e.g., King \nand Leape (1987), Blume and Zeldes (1994)). We begin this paper with an \nempirical investigation into some of the risk factors and demographic vari- \nables that might explain these cross-sectional differences in portfolio com- \nposition.

We conduct a theoretical analysis of this influence \nwhen financial assets are required to provide liquidity to personal projects. Due to \nthis liquidity consideration, individuals behave in a more risk-averse fashion when \nthere is a large penalty for discontinuing or underinvesting in the final stages of \nthe projects. In addition, using data from the 1995 Survey of Consumer Finances, \nwe find that households that are saving to invest in their own businesses or in \ntheir own homes indeed have significantly safer financial portfolios. \nA LARGE PORTION OF PRIVATE ASSETS are invested in personal illiquid projects. \nThese are projects that must be partly self-financed and are costly to sell. \nAccording to the 1995 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), residential hous- \ning and capital invested in unincorporated businesses account for 41.2 per- \ncent and 19.1 percent, respectively, of household wealth.' In this paper, we \nstudy the impact of these personal illiquid projects on individuals' portfolios \nof financial assets.

Econom-\nically plausible calibrations suggest young investors should take substantial short\npositions in the stock market. Because of cointegration the young agent’s human\ncapital effectively becomes “stock-like.” However, for older agents with shorter times-\nto-retirement, cointegration does not have sufficient time to act, and thus their hu-\nman capital becomes more “bond-like.” Together, these effects create hump-shaped\nlife-cycle portfolio holdings, consistent with empirical observation. These results hold\neven when asset return predictability is accounted for.\nTHE OPTIMAL PORTFOLIO CHOICE problem over the life cycle has received consider-\nable attention in political, financial, and academic circles. Yet, in spite of the\nvast work on this topic, there is still much disagreement across empirical ob-\nservation, conventional wisdom, and the predictions of most of the academic\nliterature.\nWhile the level of stock market participation has increased significantly over\nthe decades, several studies report that risky asset holdings have typically\nbeen low at young ages, and then either increasing or hump-shaped over the\nlife cycle (see, for example, Ameriks and Zeldes (2001), Faig and Shum (2002),\nHeaton and Lucas (2000), and Poterba and Samwick (2001)).

    "abstract": "U.S. industrial ﬁrms invest heavily in noncash, risky ﬁnancial assets such as cor-\nporate debt, equity, and mortgage-backed securities. Risky assets represent 40% of\nﬁrms’ ﬁnancial portfolios, or 6% of total book assets. We present a formal model to\nassess the optimality of this behavior. Consistent with the model, risky assets are\nconcentrated in ﬁnancially unconstrained ﬁrms holding large ﬁnancial portfolios, are\nheld by poorly governed ﬁrms, and are discounted by 13% to 22% compared to safe\nassets. We conclude that this activity represents an unregulated asset management\nindustry of more than $1.5 trillion, questioning the traditional boundaries of nonﬁ-\nnancial ﬁrms.\nA KEY ASSUMPTION IN STUDIESof corporate cash holdings is that industrial ﬁrms\ninvest in actual cash or risk-free, near-cash securities. Recent anecdotal evi-\ndence in the press, however, suggests that corporate treasuries have consider-\nably broadened the scope of securities in which they invest.

We show that if one trader needs to sell, others\nalso sell and subsequently buy back the asset. This leads to price overshooting and a\nreduced liquidation value for the distressed trader. Hence, the market is illiquid when\nliquidity is most needed. Further, a trader profits from triggering another trader’s\ncrisis, and the crisis can spill over across traders and across markets.\nLARGE TRADERS FEAR A FORCED LIQUIDATION , especially if their need to liquidate is\nknown by other traders. For example, hedge funds with (nearing) margin calls\nmay need to liquidate, and this could be known to certain counterparties such\nas the bank financing the trade. Similarly, traders who use portfolio insurance,\nstop loss orders, or other risk management strategies can be known to liquidate\nin response to price drops; a short-seller may need to cover his position if the\nprice increases significantly or if his share is recalled (i.e., a “short squeeze”);\ncertain institutions have an incentive to liquidate bonds that are downgraded\nor in default; and, intermediaries who take on large derivative positions must\nhedge them by trading the underlying security.

This compares with a\nroughly 7% probability in normal times, when neither credit nor asset price growth\nis elevated.

    "abstract": "We develop a framework for estimating expected returns—a predictive system—that\nallows predictors to be imperfectly correlated with the conditional expected return.\nWhen predictors are imperfect, the estimated expected return depends on past returns\nin a manner that hinges on the correlation between unexpected returns and innova-\ntions in expected returns. We find empirically that prior beliefs about this correlation,\nwhich is most likely negative, substantially affect estimates of expected returns as\nwell as various inferences about predictability, including assessments of a predictor’s\nusefulness. Compared to standard predictive regressions, predictive systems deliver\ndifferent expected returns with higher estimated precision.\nMANY STUDIES IN FINANCE analyze comovement between expected asset returns\nand various observable quantities, or “predictors.” A question of frequent in-\nterest is how xt, a vector of predictors observed at time t, is related to µt, the\nconditional expected return defined in the equation\nrt+1 = µt + ut+1, (1)\nwhere rt+1 denotes the stock return from timet to timet + 1, and the unexpected\nreturn ut+1 has mean zero conditional on all information available at time t.\nOne approach to modeling expected returns is to use a “predictive regression” in\nwhich r\nt+1 is regressed on xt and the expected return is given by µt = a + b′xt,\nwhere a and b denote the regression’s intercept and slope coefficients. 1 This\n∗P´astor is at the University of Chicago Booth Scho",

    "abstract": "In legal systems with expensive or ineffective contract enforcement, it is difficult to\ninduce lenders to enforce debt contracts. If lenders do not enforce, borrowers will have\nincentives to misbehave. Lenders have incentives to enforce given bad news when debt\nis short-term and subject to runs caused by externalities across lenders. Lenders will\nnot undo these externalities by negotiation. The required number of lenders increases\nwith enforcement costs. A very high enforcement cost can exceed the ex ante incentive\nbenefit of enforcement. Removing lenders’ right to immediately enforce their debt with\na “bail-in” can improve the ex ante incentives of borrowers.\nHOW SHOULD BORROWERS AND LENDERS structure financial contracts when contract\nenforcement is ineffective and costly? If contractual remedies do not benefit\nlenders, then they may not enforce their contracts. In emerging markets and\nin economies making the transition to capitalism, where the financial benefit\nfrom legal enforcement may be small, this is a much-discussed problem. Known\nas the problem of lender passivity, it describes the situation in which lenders\ndo not go to bankruptcy court after a borrower defaults (see Kornai (1979),\nMitchell (1993), and Dewatripont and Maskin (1995)). I argue that short-term\ndebt can be an effective solution to this problem.\nBorrowing with large amounts of short-term debt can lead to the threat of\nruns on firms, because there may be an externality across lenders.

    "abstract": "I describe asset price dynamics caused by the slow movement of investment capital\nto trading opportunities. The pattern of price responses to supply or demand shocks\ntypically involves a sharp reaction to the shock and a subsequent and more extended\nreversal. The amplitude of the immediate price impact and the pattern of the sub-\nsequent recovery can reﬂect institutional impediments to immediate trade, such as\nsearch costs for trading counterparties or time to raise capital by intermediaries. I\ndiscuss special impediments to capital formation during the recent ﬁnancial crisis\nthat caused asset price distortions, which subsided afterward. After presenting ex-\namples of price reactions to supply shocks in normal market settings, I offer a simple\nillustrative model of price dynamics associated with slow-moving capital due to the\npresence of inattentive investors.\nI ADDRESS THE IMPLICATIONSfor asset price dynamics of the apparent slow move-\nment of investment capital to trading opportunities. The arrival of new capital\nto an investment opportunity can be delayed by fractions of a second in some\nmarkets, for example an electronic limit-order-book market for equities, or by\nmonths in other markets, such as that for catastrophe risk insurance.

Conversely, absent commitment a Modigliani-Miller-like value irrelevance\nand policy indeterminacy result holds. Thus, the content of dynamic trade-off theory\nmust depend on the commitment technology. In this context, collateral is valuable as\na low-cost commitment device.

Previously, we thought returns were\nunpredictable, with variation in price-dividend ratios due to variation in expected\ncashﬂows. Now it seems all price-dividend variation corresponds to discount-rate\nvariation. We also thought that the cross-section of expected returns came from the\nCAPM. Now we have a zoo of new factors. I categorize discount-rate theories based\non central ingredients and data sources. Incorporating discount-rate variation affects\nﬁnance applications, including portfolio theory, accounting, cost of capital, capital\nstructure, compensation, and macroeconomics.\nASSET PRICES SHOULD EQUAL expected discounted cashﬂows. Forty years ago,\nEugene Fama (1970) argued that the expected part, “testing market efﬁciency,”\nprovided the framework for organizing asset-pricing research in that era. I\nargue that the “discounted” part better organizes our research today.\nI start with facts:how discount rates vary over time and across assets. I turn\nto theory:why discount rates vary. I attempt a categorization based on central\nassumptions and links to data, analogous to Fama’s “weak,” “semi-strong,” and\n“strong” forms of efﬁciency. Finally, I point to some applications, which I think\nwill be strongly inﬂuenced by our new understanding of discount rates. In each\ncase, I have more questions than answers.

The first is crowding—the fact that,\nfor a wide range of “unanchored” strategies, an arbitrageur cannot know how many\nof his peers are simultaneously entering the same trade. The second is leverage—\nwhen an arbitrageur chooses a privately optimal leverage ratio, he may create a fire-\nsale externality that raises the likelihood of a severe crash. In some cases, capital\nregulation may be helpful in dealing with the latter problem.\nIN THE LAST 20 YEARS or so, there have been profound changes in the way that\nmoney is managed.

    "abstract": "We study price discovery in municipal bonds, an important OTC market. As in mar-\nkets for consumer goods, prices “rise faster than they fall.” Round-trip proﬁts to\ndealers on retail trades increase in rising markets but do not decrease in falling\nmarkets. Further, effective half-spreads increase or decrease more when movements\nin fundamentals favor dealers. Yield spreads relative to Treasuries also adjust with\nasymmetric speed in rising and falling markets. Finally, intraday price dispersion is\nasymmetric in rising and falling markets, as consumer search theory would predict.\nIN A WIDE VARIETY OF CONSUMER MARKETS , prices for retail goods rise faster\nthan they fall.1 This asymmetric price adjustment, referred to as “rockets and\nfeathers,” is generally understood by economists to be inconsistent with perfect\ncompetition between sellers.

    "abstract": "We examine the role of price discovery in the U.S. Treasury market through the em-\npirical relationship between orderflow, liquidity, and the yield curve. We find that\norderflow imbalances (excess buying or selling pressure) account for up to 26% of the\nday-to-day variation in yields on days without major macroeconomic announcements.\nThe effect of orderflow on yields is permanent and strongest when liquidity is low. All\nof the evidence points toward an important role of price discovery in understanding\nthe behavior of the yield curve.\nTHE USE OF RISKLESS INTEREST RATES PERMEATES virtually every facet of economics\nand finance. It is therefore critical to understand the behavior of the term\nstructure of riskless interest rates, or the yield curve, which gives the mapping\nbetween the maturity of a riskless loan and its rate. Much of the term structure\nliterature focuses on factor models in which, at each date, the yields on all bonds\nwith different maturities are determined by the realizations of a few common\nfactors (e.g., Vasicek (1977); Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1985)). The consensus is\nthat more than one, but not many more than three factors capture the shape and\nday-to-day variation of the yield curve well. Although these factors are typically\nnot uniquely identified, it is common to think of them as the level, slope, and\ncurvature of the yield curve (e.g., Litterman and Scheinkman (1991)).\nEconomists are ultimately interested in understanding why and how the\nyield curve ch",

While market orders have a larger individ-\nual price impact, limit orders are far more numerous. This results in price discovery\noccurring predominantly through limit orders. HFTs submit the bulk of limit orders\nand these limit orders provide most of the price discovery.

We find considerable support for the existence\nof price pressure around mergers caused by uninformed shifts in excess demand, but\nthat these effects are short-lived, consistent with the notion that short-run demand\ncurves for stocks are not perfectly elastic. We estimate that nearly half of the negative\nannouncement period stock price reaction for acquirers in stock-financed mergers re-\nflects downward price pressure caused by merger arbitrage short selling, suggesting\nthat previous estimates of merger wealth effects are biased downward.\nTRADITIONAL EVENT STUDIES estimate wealth effects associated with corporate\nactions, such as mergers, by implicitly assuming that excess demand curves\nfor stocks are perfectly elastic. As a result, measured abnormal returns are\ngenerally attributed to the underlying event. For example, it has been well doc-\numented that acquiring companies that use their stock as the merger consider-\nation experience announcement period abnormal returns between −2 percent\nand −3 percent. Conversely, cash acquirers experience flat to slightly posi-\ntive abnormal returns (see Travlos (1987) and Andrade, Mitchell, and Stafford\n(2001)).

    "abstract": "Private equity has traditionally been thought to provide diversiﬁcation beneﬁts. How-\never, these beneﬁts may be lower than anticipated as we ﬁnd that private equity\nsuffers from signiﬁcant exposure to the same liquidity risk factor as public equity and\nother alternative asset classes. The unconditional liquidity risk premium is about\n3% annually and, in a four-factor model, the inclusion of this liquidity risk premium\nreduces alpha to zero. In addition, we provide evidence that the link between private\nequity returns and overall market liquidity occurs via a funding liquidity channel.\nINVESTING IN PRIVATE EQUITY IS among the preferred choices for long-term in-\nvestors, such as endowments and pension funds, who seek to diversify their\nportfolios. Such long-term investors are clearly best suited for holding an illiq-\nuid asset (i.e., one that cannot be readily traded) such as private equity.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the performance and capital inflows of private equity partner-\nships. Average fund returns (net of fees) approximately equal the S&P 500 although\nsubstantial heterogeneity across funds exists. Returns persist strongly across sub-\nsequent funds of a partnership. Better performing partnerships are more likely to\nraise follow-on funds and larger funds. This relationship is concave, so top performing\npartnerships grow proportionally less than average performers. At the industry level,\nmarket entry and fund performance are procyclical; however, established funds are\nless sensitive to cycles than new entrants. Several of these results differ markedly\nfrom those for mutual funds.\nTHE PRIVATE EQUITY INDUSTRY , primarily venture capital (VC) and buyout (LBO)\ninvestments, has grown tremendously over the last decade. While investors\ncommitted less than $10 billion to private equity partnerships in 1991, they\ncommitted more than $180 billion at the peak in 2000 (see Jesse Reyes, Private\nEquity Overview and Update 2002). Despite the increased investment in the\nprivate equity asset class and the potential importance of private equity in-\nvestments for the economy as a whole, we have only a limited understanding of\nprivate equity returns, capital flows, and their interrelation. One of the main\nobstacles has been the lack of available data. Private equity, as the name sug-\ngests, is largely exempt from public disclosure requirements.\nIn this paper, we make use of a no",

Performance in Cambridge Associates and Preqin is qualitatively similar to\nthat in Burgiss, but is lower in Venture Economics.\nDESPITE THE LARGE INCREASE in investments in private equity (PE) funds and\nthe accompanying academic and practitioner scrutiny, the historical perfor-\nmance of PE remains uncertain, if not controversial. The uncertainty has\nbeen driven by the uneven disclosure of PE returns and questions about\nthe quality of data available for research. While several commercial enter-\nprises collect performance data, they do not obtain information for all funds;\nthey often do not disclose, or even collect, fund cash ﬂows; and the source of\nthe data is sometimes obscure, resulting in concerns about sample biases.\nFurthermore, some data are only periodically made available to academic\nresearchers.\nIn this paper, we use a new research-quality data set of PE fund-level cash\nﬂows from Burgiss.

To isolate the coordination channel from lenders’\njoint reaction to new information, we exploit a natural experiment that forced lenders\nto share negative private assessments about their borrowers.

If beneﬁts\nhave the same default and recovery characteristics as state general obligation debt,\nthe national total of promised liabilities based on current salary and service is $3.20\ntrillion. If pensions have higher priority than state debt, the value of liabilities is\nmuch larger.

Independent boards reduce disclosed pay to signal their in-\ndependence, but are more likely than manager-friendly boards to use hidden pay\nor to distort incentive contracts. Stronger reputational pressures lead to lower dis-\nclosed pay, weaker managerial incentives, and higher hidden pay, whereas greater\ntransparency of executive compensation has the opposite effects. Although reputa-\ntional concerns can induce boards to choose compensation contracts more favorable to\nshareholders, we show that there is a threshold beyond which stronger reputational\nconcerns harm shareholders. Similarly, excessive pay transparency can harm share-\nholders.\nBOARDS OF DIRECTORS SET CEO pay. Understanding how directors’ incen-\ntives affect compensation contracts is therefore essential for understanding\nexecutive pay. In this paper, we model CEO pay explicitly as a board deci-\nsion determined by the extent of director independence and by directors’ rep-\nutational concerns.

    "abstract": "We study how competition in the product market affects the link between firms’ real in-\nvestment decisions and their asset return dynamics. In our model, assets in place and\ngrowth options have different sensitivities to market wide uncertainty. The strategic\nbehavior of market participants influences the relative importance of these compo-\nnents of firm value. We show that the relationship between the degree of competition\nand assets’ expected rates of return varies with product market demand. When de-\nmand is low, firms in more competitive industries earn higher returns, whereas when\ndemand is high firms in more concentrated industries earn higher returns.\nFIRMS’INVESTMENT AND OPERATING DECISIONS CAN explain conditional dynamics in\nexpected asset returns. For example, consider a firm that has an opportunity to\nexpand its current production capacity. Since this growth option has leverage\narising from its investment costs, its systematic risk may be higher than that of\nthe assets already in place. Consequently, the firm’s exposure to systematic risk\nincreases as the investment in additional capacity is more attractive because\nthe growth opportunity accounts for a larger fraction of firm value.\nMost of the recent theoretical work that links firms’ optimal investment be-\nhavior to their expected returns does not take into account the effect of compe-\ntition in the product market when analyzing the risk dynamics of the firms in a\ngiven industry.

Consistent with real option\ntheory, we ﬁnd that the positive volatility-return relation is much stronger for ﬁrms\nwith more real options and that the sensitivity of ﬁrm value to changes in volatility\ndeclines signiﬁcantly after ﬁrms exercise their real options. We reconcile the evidence\nat the aggregate and ﬁrm levels by showing that the negative relation at the aggregate\nlevel may be due to aggregate market conditions that simultaneously affect both\nmarket returns and return volatility.\nIT IS WELL ESTABLISHED in the asset pricing literature that aggregate market\nreturns are negatively correlated with aggregate market volatility (e.g.,French,\nSchwert, and Stambaugh (1987), Campbell and Hentschel (1992), andDuffee\n(1995)). One possible explanation for this negative relation is the “leverage\neffect” hypothesis (e.g.,Black (1976) and Christie (1982)), which states that\nwhen stock prices fall, ﬁrms become more levered, raising the volatility of stock\nreturns. Another explanation, due toFrench, Schwert, and Stambaugh (1987),\nholds that, because an increase in systematic volatility raises risk premia and\nexpected future stock returns, an unexpected change in (systematic) volatility is\nlikely to reduce ﬁrm values, leading to a negative association between volatility\nand contemporaneous returns.\n∗Gustavo Grullon is with the Jesse H.

Using the full text of the Federal Register, the government’s ofﬁcial daily publi-\ncation, we provide the ﬁrst systematic evidence on the extent and costs of regulatory\nfragmentation. Fragmentation increases the ﬁrm’s costs while lowering its productiv-\nity, proﬁtability, and growth. Moreover, it deters entry into an industry and increases\nthe propensity of small ﬁrms to exit. These effects arise from redundancy and, more\nprominently, from inconsistencies between government agencies. Our results uncover\na new source of regulatory burden, and we show that agency costs among regulators\ncontribute to this burden.\nTHE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS THE most inﬂuential actor in the U.S. econ-\nomy, and many studies document the signiﬁcant burden imposed by the\ngovernment on companies.

    "abstract": "In recent years, U.S. investment has been lackluster, despite rising valuations. Key\nexplanations include growing rents and growing intangibles. We propose and esti-\nmate a framework to quantify their roles. The gap between valuations—reﬂected\nin average Q—and investment—reﬂected in marginal q—can be decomposed into\nthree terms: the value of installed intangibles; rents generated by physical capital;\nand an interaction term, measuring rents generated by intangibles. The intangible\nrelated terms contribute signiﬁcantly to the gap, particularly in fast-growing sec-\ntors. Our ﬁndings suggest care in a pure-rents interpretation, given the rising role of\nintangibles.\nRECENT RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS TWO APPARENTLY contradictory, medium-\nrun facts about the U.S. economy: returns to business capital, and corporate\nproﬁts more generally, have been either stable or growing (Gomme, Ravikumar,\nand Rupert ( 2011)); yet investment has been lackluster, in particular relative\nto corporate valuations (Gutiérrez and Philippon ( 2017), Alexander and Eberly\n(2018). Ceteris paribus, investment theory would predict a rise in investment\nin response to higher returns to capital and corporate valuations.\nIn neoclassical models, the divergence between returns and investment can\nbe cast as a rising gap between the average value of business capital, or Tobin’s\naverage Q , and its marginal value, or Tobin’s marginal q .

    "abstract": "The repo market has been viewed as a potential source of ﬁnancial instability since\nthe 2007 to 2009 ﬁnancial crisis, based in part on ﬁndings that margins increased\nsharply in a segment of this market. This paper provides evidence suggesting that\nthere was no system-wide run on repo. Using conﬁdential data on tri-party repo, a\nmajor segment of this market, we show that, the level of margins and the amount of\nfunding were surprisingly stable for most borrowers during the crisis. However, we\nalso document a sharp decline in the tri-party repo funding of Lehman in September\n2008.\nREPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, OR REPOS, have been at the center of policy discussions\nsince the ﬁnancial crisis of 2007 to 2009. In particular, Gorton and Metrick\n(2012) document a large increase in margins in one segment of the repo market,\nwhich they interpret as a run.

We show that activity declined much more in the bilateral\nsegment of the market than in the tri-party segment. Surprisingly, a large share of\nthe decline in activity is driven by repos backed by Treasury securities. Further, a dis-\nproportionate share of the decline in repo activity is connected to securities dealer’s\nmarket-making activity. In particular, the evidence suggests that at least part of the\ndecline is not driven by clients pulling away from securities dealers because of coun-\nterparty credit concerns.\nTHE 2007 TO 2009 global ﬁnancial crisis (GFC) highlighted important vulner-\nabilities of the U.S. repo market. The volume of repo activity declined dramat-\nically in the fall of 2008, around the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and several\nstudies have shed some light on these events. These studies present a some-\nwhat contrasting account of what happened, in part because the authors focus\non different segments of the market, due to data limitations.

The rise of TDFs has moved a signiﬁcant share of retirement investors into\nmacrocontrarian strategies that sell stocks after relatively good stock market perfor-\nmance. This rebalancing drives contrarian ﬂows across equity mutual funds held by\nTDFs, stabilizing their funding, and reduces stock returns for stocks disproportion-\nately held by these funds when stock market returns are relatively high. Continued\ngrowth in TDFs and similar investment products may dampen stock market volatility\nand increase the transmission of shocks across asset classes.\nOVER THE PAST TWO DECADES , one of the most important ﬁnancial innova-\ntions for the typical American retail investor has been the development and\nspread of target date funds (TDFs, also called life cycle funds). A TDF is a fund\nof funds that invests in a number of mutual funds so as to maintain given\nfractions of its assets in different asset classes, such as stocks and bonds. The\nspeciﬁc asset allocation depends on the time until the investor’s expected re-\ntirement date, which is the fund’starget date.

This correlation, however, does not appear to cause a degradation\nin market quality, at least not on average.\nTHE USE OF ALGORITHMICtrading (AT), where computers monitor markets and\nmanage the trading process at high frequency, has become common in major\nﬁnancial markets in recent years, beginning in the U.S. equity market in the\n1990s.

    "abstract": "This paper explores the connection between rising intangible capital and the secular\nupward trend in U.S. corporate cash holdings. We calibrate a dynamic model with two\nproductive assets—tangible and intangible capital—in which only tangible capital\ncan serve as collateral. We highlight the following points: (i) a shift toward intangible\ncapital shrinks ﬁrms’ debt capacity and leads them to hold more cash, (ii) the effect\naccounts for three-quarters of the observed trend in average cash ratios, and (iii) it\nalso accounts for the upward trend of cash ratios in the cross-section of small and\nlarge ﬁrms and in the aggregate.\nPUBLIC CORPORATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES have undergone fundamen-\ntal changes over the last decades. On the ﬁnancial side, they have steadily\nincreased cash holdings on their balance sheets, an issue that has attracted\nwide attention in the popular press, with commentators expressing the con-\ncern that the “corporate saving glut” might hamper growth of the U.S. econ-\nomy and even suggesting that corporate savings be taxed.

    "abstract": "Using a model of market making with inventories based on Biais (1993), we find \nthat investors obtain more favorable execution prices, and they hence invest more, \nwhen markets are fragmented. In our model, risk-averse dealers use less aggres- \nsive price strategies in more transparent markets (centralized) because quote dis- \nsemination alleviates uncertainty about the prices quoted by other dealers and, \nhence, reduces the need to compete aggressively for order flow. Further, we show \nthat the move toward greater transparency (centralization) may have detrimental \neffects on liquidity and welfare. \nSTOCK EXCHANGES EVERYWHERE ARE ENGAGED in a contest for economies of scale \nand scope. In May 2000, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Bourse \nannounced a merger, along with a joint venture with America's Nasdaq, an \nagreement that eventually came apart.

We observe that dealers use futures to take directional \nbets and hedge changes in their spot exposure.

The\ndecline in business credit was driven by increased risk overhang effects (consistent\nwith a reduction in the liquidity of assets held on bank balance sheets) and by reduced\nloan supply elasticities suggestive of credit rationing (consistent with an increase\nin lender risk aversion). Nevertheless, we identify a group of strategically focused\nrelationship banks that made and maintained higher levels of business loans during\nthe crisis.\nSMALL BUSINESSES, DEFINED AS HAVINGfewer than 500 employees, employ about\none-half of the U.S. labor force and create nearly two-thirds of net new private\nsector jobs in the United States annually (U.S. Small Business Administration\n(2014)).

We develop a novel arbitrage-free dynamic term structure model in which\nbond investment decisions are inﬂuenced by output and inﬂation risks that are un-\nspanned by (imperfectly correlated with) information about the shape of the yield\ncurve. Our model reveals that, between 1985 and 2007, these risks accounted for a\nlarge portion of the variation in forward terms premiums, and there was pronounced\ncyclical variation in the market prices of level and slope risks.\nA POWERFUL IMPLICATION of virtually all macro-ﬁnance afﬁne term structure\nmodels (MTSMs)—reduced-form and equilibrium alike—is that the macro fac-\ntors that determine bond prices are fully spanned by the current yield curve. 1\nThat is, the afﬁne mapping between bond yields and the risks in the macroe-\nconomy in these models can be inverted to express these risk factors as lin-\near combinations of yields.

In that case, imposing no-short-sale con- \nstraints should hurt, whereas empirical evidence is often to the contrary. We \nreconcile this apparent contradiction. We explain why constraining portfolio \nweights to be nonnegative can reduce the risk in estimated optimal portfolios \neven when the constraints are wrong.

    "abstract": "When countries liberalize their stock markets, firms that become eligible for foreign\npurchase (investible), experience an average stock price revaluation of 15.1%. Since\nthe historical covariance of the average investible firm’s stock return with the lo-\ncal market is roughly 200 times larger than its historical covariance with the world\nmarket, liberalization reduces the systematic risk associated with holding investible\nsecurities. Consistent with this fact: (1) the average effect of the reduction in system-\natic risk is 6.8 percentage points, or roughly two fifths of the total revaluation; and\n(2) the firm-specific revaluations are directly proportional to the firm-specific changes\nin systematic risk.\nASSET PRICING THEORY PREDICTS that capital will be allocated in such a way that\nrisk-adjusted returns are equalized across assets.

Margin calls after bad news\ncan improve protection sellers’ incentives and in turn enhance risk-sharing. Central\nclearing can provide insurance against counterparty risk but must be designed to\npreserve risk-prevention incentives.\nDERIVATIVES ACTIVITY HAS GROWN strongly over the past 15 years.

    "abstract": "The reliability of traditional asset pricing tests depends on: (i) the correlations be-\ntween asset returns and factors; (ii) the time series sample sizeT compared to the\nnumber of assets N. For macro-risk factors, like consumption growth, (i) and (ii)\nare often such that traditional tests cannot be trusted. We extend the Gibbons-Ross-\nShanken statistic to test identiﬁcation of risk premia and construct their 95% conﬁ-\ndence sets. These sets are wide or unbounded whenT and N are close, but show that\naverage returns are not fully spanned by betas whenT exceeds N considerably. Our\nﬁndings indicate when meaningful empirical inference is feasible.\nCLASSICAL CONSUMPTION-BASED ASSET PRICING THEORY relates asset returns to\nconsumption risk. Yet a worrisome phenomenon is that different measures of\nconsumption lead to different empirical ﬁndings. It has been well documented\nthat the canonical consumption measure from the National Income and Prod-\nuct Accounts (NIPA) leads to small correlations between consumption growth\nand asset returns that could be improved by adopting alternative consump-\ntion measures, including the three-year consumption measure in Parker and\nJulliard (2005), the fourth-quarter to fourth-quarter consumption measure in\nJagannathan and Wang (2007), the garbage measure in Savov (2011), and the\nunﬁltered NIPA consumption measure in Kroencke (2017).\nThe credibility of these consumption measures for asset pricing is commonly\ntested using two methodologies: (i) the two",

    "abstract": "We argue that short sellers affect prices in a significant and systematic man- \nner. In particular, we contend that speculative short sales contribute to the \nweekend effect: The inability to trade over the weekend is likely to cause these \nshort sellers to close their speculative positions on Fridays and reestablish \nnew short positions on Mondays causing stock prices to rise on Fridays and \nfall on Mondays.We find evidence in support of this hypothesis based on a com- \nparison of high short-interest stocks and low short-interest stocks, stocks \nwith and without actively traded options, IPOs, zero short-interest stocks, \nand highly volatile stocks. \nIN THIS PAPER, we empirically examine whether speculative short sales affect \nprices in a systematic manner. The focus is on the weekend effect that has re- \nmained an unexplained anomaly. Beginning with French (1980) and Gibbons \nand Hess (1981), there is much evidence in support of higher returns on Fridays \nand lower returns on Mondays. Keim and Stambaugh (1984) find that Friday re- \nturns are lower when there is Saturday trading. Ariel (1990) finds that a signifi- \ncantly larger number of stocks rises preholiday than postholiday.

    "title": "Rollover Risk and Credit Risk",
    "abstract": "Our model shows that deterioration in debt market liquidity leads to an increase\nin not only the liquidity premium of corporate bonds but also credit risk. The latter\neffect originates from ﬁrms’ debt rollover. When liquidity deterioration causes a ﬁrm\nto suffer losses in rolling over its maturing debt, equity holders bear the losses while\nmaturing debt holders are paid in full. This conﬂict leads the ﬁrm to default at a higher\nfundamental threshold. Our model demonstrates an intricate interaction between the\nliquidity premium and default premium and highlights the role of short-term debt in\nexacerbating rollover risk.\nTHE YIELD SPREAD OFa ﬁrm’s bond relative to the risk-free interest rate directly\ndetermines the ﬁrm’s debt ﬁnancing cost, and is often referred to as its credit\nspread. It is widely recognized that the credit spread reﬂects not only a default\npremium determined by the ﬁrm’s credit risk but also a liquidity premium due\nto illiquidity of the secondary debt market (e.g.,Longstaff, Mithal, and Neis\n(2005) and Chen, Lesmond, and Wei (2007)). However, academics and policy\nmakers tend to treat both the default premium and the liquidity premium\nas independent, and thus ignore interactions between them. The ﬁnancial\ncrisis of 2007 to 2008 demonstrates the importance of such an interaction—\ndeterioration in debt market liquidity caused severe ﬁnancing difﬁculties for\nmany ﬁnancial ﬁrms, which in turn exacerbated their credit risk.\nIn this paper, we develop a theoretical ",

    "abstract": "This paper studies how a ﬁnancial system that is organized to efﬁciently create safe\nassets responds to macroeconomic shocks. Financial intermediaries face a cost of\nbearing risk, so they choose the least risky portfolio that backs their issuance of risk-\nless deposits: a diversiﬁed pool of nonﬁnancial ﬁrms’ debt. Nonﬁnancial ﬁrms choose\ntheir capital structure to exploit the resulting segmentation between debt and equity\nmarkets. Increased safe asset demand yields larger and riskier intermediaries and\nmore levered ﬁrms. Quantitative easing reduces the size and riskiness of interme-\ndiaries and can decrease ﬁrm leverage, despite reducing borrowing costs at the zero\nlower bound.\nAN IMPORTANT ROLE OF FINANCIAL intermediaries is to issue safe, money-\nlike assets, such as bank deposits and money market fund shares. As an empir-\nical literature has documented (Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2012),\nSunderam (2015), Nagel (2016)), these assets have a low rate of return that\nis strictly below the risk-free rate they would earn without providing mone-\ntary services. Agents who can issue these assets therefore raise ﬁnancing on\nattractive terms, capturing the “demand for safe assets” that pushes their cost\nof borrowing below that of others.

    "abstract": "Using new econometric methods, we separately estimate average transaction costs for\nover 167,000 bonds from a 1-year sample of all U.S. municipal bond trades. Municipal\nbond transaction costs decrease with trade size and do not depend significantly on\ntrade frequency. Also, municipal bond trades are substantially more expensive than\nsimilar-sized equity trades. We attribute these results to the lack of bond market\nprice transparency. Additional cross-sectional analyses show that bond trading costs\nincrease with credit risk, instrument complexity, time to maturity, and time since\nissuance. Investors, and perhaps ultimately issuers, might benefit if issuers issued\nsimpler bonds.\nTHE U.S. MUNICIPAL BOND MARKET HAS VERY little trade price transparency and\nalmost no quote transparency.

We exploit the inability of Fannie\nMae and Freddie Mac to purchase jumbo mortgages to identify an exogenous change\nin liquidity. The volume of jumbo mortgage originations relative to nonjumbo origina-\ntions increases with bank holdings of liquid assets and decreases with bank deposit\ncosts. This result suggests that the increasing depth of the mortgage secondary mar-\nket fostered by securitization has reduced the effect of lender’s financial condition on\ncredit supply.\nLIQUIDITY TRANSFORMATION— THE FUNDING OF ILLIQUID LOANS with liquid deposits—\nhas been viewed as a fundamental role of banks.

I find that it is often optimal to issue\ninformation-sensitive securities such as equity. The “folklore proposition of debt” from\ntraditional signaling models only goes through if the firm can vary the face value of\ndebt with investor demand. When the firm has several assets, debt backed by a pool of\nassets is optimal when the degree of competition among investors is low, while equity\nbacked by individual assets is optimal when competition is high.\nMOST INFORMATION -BASED THEORIES of security design, starting with Myers and\nMajluf (1984), make the assumption that the issuing firm has private informa-\ntion about the value of its assets. This leads to a problem for the firm when it\nattempts to raise capital. Since investors will worry about being sold a lemon,\na genuinely good firm that cannot signal its quality properly to the market\nwill face underpricing when it issues securities. Accordingly, the firm will de-\nsign the securities to minimize this underpricing. This theory has been applied\nfruitfully to explain the financing behavior of firms.

In the 100 days following put option issues,\nthere is roughly a 5% abnormal stock return, with much of the abnormal return\nfollowing the ﬁrst earnings release date after the sale. Direct evidence on put option\nexercises reinforces these ﬁndings: exercise frequencies and payoffs to put holders are\nabnormally low.\nDURING THE 1991 TO 2004 PERIOD, many large U.S. ﬁrms, including Bank of\nAmerica, Boeing, IBM, McDonald’s, and Microsoft, sold puts on their own stock.\nOur study is the ﬁrst large-scale empirical analysis of these corporate trans-\nactions.

Given the \ntight publication deadlines there was not sufficient time for authors to make \nrevisions and for discussants to base their comments on the final versions. \nInstead I asked discussants to base their comments on the version presented \nat the meetings.

I ﬁnd that IR ﬁrms “spin”\ntheir clients’ news, generating more media coverage of positive press releases than\nnegative press releases. This spin increases announcement returns. Around earnings\nannouncements, however, IR ﬁrms cannot spin the news and their clients’ returns are\nsigniﬁcantly lower.

Using re-\nporter connections and geographical links, I argue that IR ﬁrms causally affect both\nmedia coverage and returns.\nDOES A COMPANY’S MARKETING OFits news matter?

    "abstract": "I analyze a model in which holding cash imposes a negative externality: it worsens\nfuture adverse selection in markets for long-term assets, which impairs their role\nfor liquidity provision. Adverse selection worsens when potential sellers of long-term\nassets hold more cash because then fewer sales reﬂect cash needs, and proportionally\nmore sales reﬂect private information. Moreover, future market illiquidity makes\ncurrent cash holding more appealing. This feedback effect may result in hoarding\nbehavior and a market breakdown, which I interpret as a self-fulﬁlling liquidity\ndry-up. This mechanism suggests that imposing liquidity requirements on ﬁnancial\ninstitutions may backﬁre.\nA NUMBER OF POLICY makers and academics have pointed out unusual cash\nhoarding behavior by major ﬁnancial institutions since the 2007 to 2009 ﬁ-\nnancial crisis in general and a further surge in the euro area since the end\nof 2011.\n1 Many have also expressed concerns that such behavior worsens eco-\nnomic outcomes,2 a topic to which several recent academic studies have been\n∗Fr´ed´eric Malherbe is with the London Business School.

We document\nthat failed banks are predominantly sold to bidders within the same county, with\nsimilar assets business lines, when these bidders are well capitalized. Otherwise,\nthey are acquired by less similar banks located further away. We interpret these facts\nwithin a model of auctions with budget constraints, in which poor capitalization of\nsome potential acquirers drives a wedge between their willingness and ability to pay\nfor failed banks. We document that this wedge drives misallocation, and partially\nexplains the FDIC losses from failed bank sales.\nTHE GREAT RECESSION and its aftermath saw an unprecedented number of\nbanks being taken into receivership by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corpo-\nration (FDIC) and then sold at auction.

They also\nconvey external beneﬁts, helping to uncover misconduct and keeping prices closer to\nfundamental values.\nSHORT SELLING IS A CONTROVERSIAL ACTIVITY. Detractors claim that short sell-\ners undermine investors’ conﬁdence in ﬁnancial markets and decrease market\nliquidity. For example, a short seller can spread false rumors about a ﬁrm\nin which he has a short position and proﬁt from the resulting decline in the\nstock price.1 Advocates, in contrast, argue that short selling facilitates market\nefﬁciency and the price discovery process. Investors who identify overpriced\nﬁrms can sell short, thereby incorporating their unfavorable information into\nmarket prices.

    "abstract": "During 2005 to 2007, the SEC ordered a pilot program in which one-third of the\nRussell 3000 index were arbitrarily chosen as pilot stocks and exempted from short-\nsale price tests. Pilot ﬁrms’ discretionary accruals and likelihood of marginally beating\nearnings targets decrease during this period, and revert to pre-experiment levels when\nthe program ends. After the program starts, pilot ﬁrms are more likely to be caught\nfor fraud initiated before the program, and their stock returns better incorporate\nearnings information. These results indicate that short selling, or its prospect, curbs\nearnings management, helps detect fraud, and improves price efﬁciency.\nPREVIOUS RESEARCH SHOWSthat short sellers can identify earnings manipulation\nand fraud before they are publicly revealed.1 But this is for earnings manip-\nulation that has already taken place. Might short selling also constrain ﬁrms’\nincentives to manipulate or misrepresent earnings in the ﬁrst place? That is,\ndoes the prospect of short selling help improve the quality of ﬁrms’ ﬁnancial\nreporting?\nIn this paper we exploit a randomized experiment that allows us to address\nthis question.

Unlike longer-dated options, they are largely\ninsensitive to the risk of intertemporal shifts in the economic environment. Adopting\na novel seminonparametric approach, we uncover variation in the negative jump\ntail risk, which is not spanned by market volatility and helps predict future equity\nreturns. As such, our approach allows for easy identiﬁcation of periods of heightened\nconcerns about negative tail events that are not always “signaled” by the level of\nmarket volatility and elude standard asset pricing models.\nRECENT YEARS HAVE WITNESSED A RAPID INCREASE in the trading of short-dated\noptions. For instance, S&P 500 option contracts with one week or less to matu-\nrity have seen their share of trading at the Chicago Board of Options Exchange\n(CBOE) rise steadily from about 10% in early 2010 to almost 30% in mid-2015.\nFurthermore, the volume in shorter-dated options is disproportionately skewed\ntoward out-of-the-money (OTM) options relative to the pattern for longer-dated\noptions.

These\nfindings are consistent with Miller’s (1977) intuition and other optimism models. We\nalso document higher volatility and less positive skewness of individual stock returns\nwhen short sales are allowed.\nTHE QUESTION OF HOW SHORT SALES IMPACT capital markets is highly controversial,\nwith short-sale regulations varying widely across countries and capital mar-\nkets.1 Although short selling has been carried out for years in major financial\nmarkets around the world, its effects on market efficiency, especially on pricing\nefficiency, remain of interest to financial researchers.\nMiller (1977) theorizes that in the presence of short-sales constraints, secu-\nrity prices tend to reflect a more optimistic valuation than the average opinion\nof potential investors and thus tend to be upward biased.

    "title": "Social Interaction and Stock&#x2010;Market Participation",
    "abstract": "We propose that stock-market participation is influenced by social interaction. In our\nmodel, any given “social” investor finds the market more attractive when more of his\npeers participate. We test this theory using data from the Health and Retirement\nStudy, and find that social households—those who interact with their neighbors, or\nattend church—are substantially more likely to invest in the market than non-social\nhouseholds, controlling for wealth, race, education, and risk tolerance. Moreover, con-\nsistent with a peer-effects story, the impact of sociability is stronger in states where\nstock-market participation rates are higher.\nIN 1998, 48.9 PERCENT OF AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS owned stock, either directly, or\nthrough mutual funds or various retirement vehicles such as 401(k) plans or\nIRAs.1 While this number may appear low in an absolute sense—particularly\nin light of the historically high returns to investing in the stock market—it\nactually represents an all-time peak in the United States, and a dramatic in-\ncrease from prior years. For example, less than a decade earlier, in 1989, the\nparticipation rate stood at only 31.6 percent; even as late as 1995 it was at just\n40.4 percent.\nWhat are the underlying determinants of the stock-market participation\nrate? This question is an important one, for a number of reasons.

    "abstract": "Debt initial public offerings (IPOs) represent a major shift in a firm's financing \npolicy by both extending debt maturity and altering the public-private debt mix. In \ncontrast to findings for seasoned debt offerings, we document a significantly neg- \native stock price response to debt IPO announcements. This result is consistent \nwith debt maturity and debt ownership structure theories. The equity wealth ef- \nfect is negatively related to the offer's maturity, and positively related to the de- \ngree of bank monitoring. We find that firms with less information asymmetry and \nfirms with higher growth opportunities experience a less adverse stock price response. \nThe decision to access the public debt market for the first time represents a \nmajor change in a firm's financing policy. An initial public debt offer alters \nthe firm's debt structure in two significant ways. Not only does this policy \nchoice affect the firm's debt ownership structure, by altering its mix of pub- \nlic relative to private debt, but it also extends the average debt maturity of \nthe firm substantially.

Empirical results show strong evidence for spot-price\nlevel dependence in convenience yields for crude oil and copper, which implies mean\nreversion in prices under the risk-neutral measure.

    "abstract": "We explore the cross-sectional pricing of volatility risk by decomposing equity market\nvolatility into short- and long-run components. Our finding that prices of risk are\nnegative and significant for both volatility components implies that investors pay for\ninsurance against increases in volatility, even if those increases have little persistence.\nThe short-run component captures market skewness risk, which we interpret as a\nmeasure of the tightness of financial constraints. The long-run component relates to\nbusiness cycle risk. Furthermore, a three-factor pricing model with the market return\nand the two volatility components compares favorably to benchmark models.\nWHEN MARKET VOLATILITY IS STOCHASTIC , intertemporal models predict that asset\nrisk premia are not only determined by covariation of returns with the mar-\nket return, but also by covariation with the state variables that govern market\nvolatility. To study this prediction, we model the log-volatility of the market\nportfolio as the sum of a short- and a long-run volatility component.

Equity beta and return volatility are lower in countries where\nthe bankruptcy code favors debt renegotiations and for ﬁrms with more shareholder\nbargaining power relative to debt holders. These relations weaken as the country’s\ninsolvency procedure favors liquidations over renegotiations. In the limit, when debt\ncontracts cannot be renegotiated, equity risk is independent of shareholders’ incen-\ntives to default strategically. We argue that these ﬁndings support the hypothesis\nthat the threat of strategic default can reduce the ﬁrm’s equity risk.\nWHEN A FIRM IS IN FINANCIAL DISTRESS, its shareholders and debt holders may\nbeneﬁt from a debt renegotiation to avoid an inefﬁcient bankruptcy or liquida-\ntion.

    "abstract": "I ﬁnd that economically meaningless index labels cause stock returns to covary in\nexcess of fundamentals. S&P/Barra follow a simple mechanical procedure to deﬁne\ntheir Value and Growth indices. In doing so, they reclassify some stocks from Value\nto Growth even after their book-to-market ratios have risen, and vice versa. Such\nstocks begin to covary more with the index they join and less with the index they\nleave. Backdated constituent data from Barra reveal no such label-related shifts in\ncomovement during the 10 years prior to the actual introduction of the indices in\n1992.\nINVESTORS MUST CHOOSE among thousands of ﬁnancial assets when allocating\ncapital. Financial institutions seek to reduce the complexity of this task for\ninvestors by labeling assets. Bond ratings, index assignments, industry des-\nignations, and other labels group assets with similar characteristics into a\nrelatively small number of categories. Investors can then trade entire asset\ncategories without scrutinizing individual assets. In the terminology that Bar-\nberis and Shleifer (2003) use, labels deﬁne speciﬁc asset “styles,” and investors\nwho allocate funds across labels rather than individual securities practice a\nform of “style investing.” The capital ﬂows of such an investor in and out of\nspeciﬁc assets are perfectly correlated across securities with the same label\neven though the fundamental values of these securities are at most only par-\ntially related.

    "abstract": "Why do stock prices vary? Using survey forecasts, we ﬁnd that cash ﬂow growth ex-\npectations explain most movements in the S&P 500 price-dividend and price-earnings\nratios, accounting for at least 93% and 63% of their variation. These expectations co-\nmove strongly with price ratios, even when price ratios do not predict future cash\nﬂow growth. In comparison, return expectations have low volatility and small co-\nmovement with price ratios. Short-term, rather than long-term, expectations account\nfor most price ratio variation.

Contrary to conventional wisdom, we argue \nthat the survival bias in the U.S. data is unlikely to be significant. To reach this \nconclusion, we introduce a general framework for modeling survival and derive a \nmathematical relationship between the ex ante survival probability and the aver- \nage survival bias. This relationship reveals the fundamental difficulty facing the \nsurvival argument: High survival bias requires an ex ante probability of market \nfailure, which seems unrealistically high given the history of world financial markets. \nIN AN INFLUENTIAL PAPER, Brown, Goetzmann, and Ross (1995; hereafter BGR) \nargue that there could be serious survival bias in the observed U.S. equity \npremium.

The risk of joint liquidation creates an\nincentive for investors to choose heterogeneous portfolios and to rationally forgo di-\nversiﬁcation beneﬁts. Joint liquidation risk is also reﬂected in asset prices, resulting\nin (1) assets with high idiosyncratic risk having low expected returns, and (2) as-\nsets that display high correlation with the portfolios of (liquidation-prone) investors\nhaving high expected returns.\nINVESTORS, PARTICULARLY IF THEY AREleveraged, often have to liquidate following\na decline in the value of their portfolios.

The presence of a defense is \nnegatively related to subsequent acquisition likelihood, yet has no impact on take- \nover premiums for firms that are acquired. These results do not support argu- \nments that takeover defenses facilitate the eventual sale of IPO firms at high \ntakeover premiums. Rather, they suggest that managers shift the cost of takeover \nprotection onto nonmanagerial shareholders.

    "abstract": "The notion that firms have a debt ratio target that is a primary determinant of financ-\ning behavior is influential in finance. Yet, how definitive is the evidence? We address\nthis issue by generating samples where financing is unrelated to a firm’s current debt\nratio or a target. We find that much of the available evidence in favor of target be-\nhavior based on leverage ratio changes can be reproduced for these samples. Taken\ntogether, our findings suggest that a number of existing tests of target behavior have\nno power to reject alternatives.\nA TRADITIONAL VIEW IN FINANCE IS that firms have debt ratio targets. For example,\nthe notion of the weighted average cost of capital—taught to generations of\nfinance students and recommended as the discount rate in capital budgeting—\npresupposes the existence of “target capital structure” weights. Tradeoff models\nthat stress various costs and benefits of debt imply the existence of an optimal\ndebt ratio, and it is assumed that firms make financing choices that minimize\nthe cost of deviation from this optimum. In this paper, we evaluate some of\nthe evidence in favor of the view that firms’ financing choices reflect target\nbehavior. We interpret target behavior to mean that a firm’s financing choice at\nany point in time is a function of its current debt ratio as well as a “target” debt\nratio.

    "abstract": "We examine ex-dividend date trading of American Depositary Receipts \n(ADRs) using a sample of 1,043 dividends over the period 1988 to 1995. ADR \ndividends are often subject to foreign withholding taxes, creating incentives \nfor certain investors to avoid the distribution. ADRs exhibit negative abnor- \nmal ex-dividend day returns, and their prices behave consistently with their \nrelated withholding taxes. Abnormal trading volume for taxable issues ex- \nceeds 130 percent and 300 percent of normal volume on the cum- and ex-dates, \nrespectively. Abnormal volume is an increasing function of foreign withhold- \ning tax rates and decreasing function of transactions costs. This abnormal ex- \ndate trading activity is consistent with tax-motivated trading. \nTHIS PAPER PROVIDES EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE from a sample of American Depositary \nReceipts (ADRs) that foreign taxes on dividend income are positively associated \nwith abnormal ex-dividend day trading activity. Researchers have long been \ninterested in the question of whether taxes affect investor behavior around \nex-dividend days. Such work has implications for corporate financial and distri- \nbution policies and for government tax policies. ADRs provide a unique setting in \nwhich to examine the effects of taxes on investor trading behavior because of the \nunique features of the foreign withholding taxes that apply to them. \nA number of studies have attempted to isolate the determinants of ex-dividend \nday pricing and trading activity of",

Examining turn-of-the-year return and volume\npatterns for municipal bond closed-end funds, which are held mostly by tax-sensitive\nindividual investors, we document a January effect for these funds, but not for their\nunderlying assets.

    "abstract": "We document important interactions between tax incentives and corporate policies\nusing a “quasi natural experiment” provided by a surprise announcement that im-\nposed corporate taxes on a group of Canadian publicly traded ﬁrms. The announce-\nment caused a dramatic decrease in value. Prospective tax shields partially offset\nthe losses, adding 4.6% to ﬁrm value on average, and vary with the tax status of the\nmarginal investor. Further, ﬁrms adjust leverage, payout, cash holdings, and invest-\nment in response to changing tax incentives.

    "abstract": "Implicit tax rates priced in the cross section of municipal bonds are approximately\ntwo to three times as high as statutory income tax rates, with implicit tax rates close\nto 100% using retail trades and above 70% for interdealer trades. These implied tax\nrates can be identiﬁed because a portion of secondary market municipal bond trades\ninvolves income taxes. After valuing the tax payments, market discount bonds, which\ncarry income tax liabilities, trade at yields around 25 basis points higher than com-\nparable municipal bonds not subject to any taxes. The high sensitivities of municipal\nbond prices to tax rates can be traced to individual retail traders dominating dealers\nand other institutions.\nTHE ISSUE OF HOW TAXES AFFECT ASSET PRICESis an important issue in ﬁnance,\naccounting, and economics. In theoretical models examining the effect of taxes\non different assets and agents (e.g., Auerbach and King (1983), Dybvig and\nRoss (1986), and Dammon and Green (1987)), taxes induce clientele effects\nin agents’ asset holdings and the existence of multiple tax rates affects rela-\ntive asset prices. In reality, however, estimating implicit tax rates on assets is\nmore difﬁcult than theoretical models suggest because of the myriad ways the\ntax code can be distorted, large investor heterogeneity, and the many degrees\nof market frictions different investors face.

Thus risk compensation cannot vary \nindependently of interest rate volatility. I also describe a broader class of models. \nThese \"essentially affine\" models retain the tractability of standard models, but \nallow compensation for interest rate risk to vary independently of interest rate \nvolatility.

Intriguingly, we find that, controlling for Tobin’s q,s a v -\ning and cash flow are negatively related because firms lower cash reserves to invest\nafter receiving positive cash-flow shocks, and vice versa. Consistent with theory, we\nestimate negative propensities to save out of cash flow. We also find that income uncer-\ntainty affects saving more than do external finance constraints. Therefore, contrary to\nprevious evidence, saving propensities reflect too many forces to be used to measure\nexternal finance constraints.\nWHY DO CORPORATIONS SAVE ? In other words, why do they funnel their cash flow\ninto liquid asset holdings rather than into physical capital or into shareholder\ndistributions? This question is challenging because such financial decisions\ncannot be understood in isolation of the real decisions a corporation makes.\nNot only is the question challenging, but it is also economically interesting in\nlight of the tendency in recent years of both U.S. and European firms to accu-\nmulate unusually high levels of cash.

Our evidence suggests\nthat this willingness is affected by both pecuniary and non-pecuniary factors, such\nas views about fairness and morality. We also ﬁnd that exposure to other people who\nstrategically defaulted increases the propensity to default strategically because it\nconveys information about the probability of being sued.\nIN 2009, FOR THE ﬁrst time since the Great Depression, millions of American\nhouseholds found themselves with a mortgage that exceeded the value of their\nhome. According to First American CoreLogic, more than 15.2 million U.S.\nmortgages, or 32.2% of all mortgaged properties, were in a negative equity po-\nsition as of June 30, 2009, while in some states (such as Arizona and Nevada)\nthis number exceeded 50%. 1 Importantly, the difference between the value of\nthe house and that of the mortgage is often very large.

    "abstract": "Seasoned offers were underpriced by an average of 2.2 percent during the \n1980s and 1990s, with the discount increasing substantially over time. The in- \ncrease appears to be related to Rule 10b-21 and to economic changes affecting \nboth IPOs and SEOs. Consistent with temporary price pressure, underpricing \nis positively related to offer size especially for securities with relatively inelas- \ntic demand. Underpricing is also positively related to price uncertainty and, \nafter Rule 10b-21, to the magnitude of preoffer returns. Additionally, I find that \nunderpricing is significantly related to underwriter pricing conventions such \nas price rounding and pricing relative to the bid quote. \nBEGINNING WITH SMITH (1977), numerous empirical studies have documented signif- \nicant underpricing for seasoned equity offerings (SEOs) in the United States. \nPrior studies also point to considerable cross-sectional variation in SEO pricing. \nFor example, Loderer, Sheehan, and Kadlec (1991) report significant differences \nin underpricing between exchange-listed securities and Nasdaq stocks.While the \nmagnitude of SEO underpricing has been relatively small historically, it in- \ncreased dramatically during the 1990s.

    "abstract": "Diversified firms have different values from comparable portfolios of single- \nsegment firms. These value differences must be due to differences in either future \ncash flows or future returns. Expected security returns on diversified firms vary \nsystematically with relative value. Discount firms have significantly higher sub- \nsequent returns than premium firms. Slightly more than half of the cross-sectional \nvariation in excess values is due to variation in expected future cash flows, with \nthe remainder due to variation in expected future returns and to covariation be- \ntween cash flows and returns. \nTHE VALUE OF ANY ASSET DEPENDS mechanically on the asset's future cash flows \nand future returns. This fact is, by definition, true both for actual future \ncash flows and returns and for expected future cash flows and returns. High \nfuture cash flows imply high value today, and high future returns imply low \nvalue today. Thus, to explain the value of an asset, one needs to examine \nexpected future cash flows and expected future returns. \nIn recent years, the average diversified firm has been worth less than a \nportfolio of comparable single-segment firms (Lang and Stulz (1994), Berger \nand Ofek (1995)).

The stock share\nof liquid wealth would rise by 1 percentage point—6% of the mean stock share—if a\nhousehold were to spend 10% less on its house, holding ﬁxed wealth.\nHOUSES ARE THE LARGEST ASSETS OWNED by most households, but the impact\nof housing on ﬁnancial markets remains unclear. Many models predict that\nhousing tends to reduce the demand for risky assets because it increases a\nhousehold’s exposure to risk and illiquidity (Grossman and Laroque ( 1990),\nBrueckner (1997), Fratantoni ( 2001), Flavin and Yamashita ( 2002), Chetty and\nSzeidl ( 2007)). But empirical studies have not found a systematic relationship\nbetween housing and portfolios in practice (Fratantoni ( 1998), Heaton and\nLucas (2000), Yamashita ( 2003), Cocco ( 2005)).\nThis paper reconciles the theory with the data.

The law’s main goal was to improve the quality of\nﬁnancial reporting and to increase investor conﬁdence. The Securities and Ex-\nchange Commission (SEC) was put in charge of enforcing the law.

Interest rates charged by the consolidated banks \ndecrease, but as the local market share of the acquired bank increases, the effi- \nciency effect is offset by market power. Mergers have different distributional ef- \nfects across borrowers. When banks become larger, they reduce the supply of loans \nto small borrowers. \nTHERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT worldwide banking consolidation in recent years. \nBerger et al.

In particular, firms issue \nrelatively more equity than debt just before periods of low market returns. The \nequity share in new issues has stable predictive power in both halves of the sample \nperiod and after controlling for other known predictors. We do not find support for \nefficient market explanations of the results. Instead, the fact that the equity share \nsometimes predicts significantly negative market returns suggests inefficiency and \nthat firms time the market component of their returns when issuing securities. \nIN THEIR CLASSIC PROOF of the irrelevance of financing policy, Modigliani and \nMiller (1958) implicitly assume market efficiency.

At the same time, accounting for various other factors,\nindustry risk is unlikely to be associated with CEO compensation other than through\ndismissal risk. Using this identiﬁcation strategy, we document that CEO turnover\nrisk is signiﬁcantly positively associated with compensation. This ﬁnding is important\nbecause job-risk-compensating wage differentials arise naturally in competitive labor\nmarkets. By contrast, the evidence rejects an entrenchment model according to which\npowerful CEOs have lower job risk and at the same time secure higher compensation.\nTHIS PAPER INVESTIGATESthe idea that turnover risk is priced in executive com-\npensation. In light of the ongoing discussion about pay practices in U.S. corpora-\ntions and worldwide, understanding this relationship is of particular interest.\nA positive association between dismissal risk and pay in the cross section of\nCEOs is a central prediction of a competitive labor market model. In such a\nmodel, pay in “constrained” sectors (where job risk exists and results in costs\nfor dismissed employees) needs to be higher than in “unconstrained” sectors to\ncompensate for job risk (Abowd and Ashenfelter (1981)). Consistent with this\nhypothesis, our results provide considerable evidence that CEOs who are ex-\nposed to higher job risk are paid more than CEOs who enjoy more job security.\n1\n∗Peters is with University of Amsterdam,",

    "abstract": "We examine 1,948 share lockup agreements that prevent insiders from selling their \nshares in the period immediately after the IPO (typically 180 days). While lockups \nare in effect, there is little selling by insiders. When lockups expire, we find a \npermanent 40 percent increase in average trading volume, and a statistically prom- \ninent three-day abnormal return of - 1.5 percent. The abnormal return and volume \nare much larger when the firm is financed by venture capital, and we find that \nventure capitalists sell more aggressively than executives and other shareholders. \nWe find limited support for several hypotheses that may explain the abnormal \nreturn, but no complete explanation. \nMOST IPOS FEATURE SHARE LOCKUP AGREEMENTS, which prohibit insiders and \nother pre-IPO shareholders from selling any of their shares for a specified \nperiod. The typical lockup lasts for 180 days, and covers most of the shares \nthat are not sold in the IPO. The terms of the lockup, including the expira- \ntion or \"unlock\" date, are disclosed in the IPO prospectus. Lockups serve \nseveral purposes. They reassure the market that key employees will con- \ntinue to exert themselves for at least a few months; they provide a credible \nsignal that insiders are not attempting to cash out in advance of imminent \nbad news; and they may aid the underwriters' price support efforts by tem- \nporarily constraining the supply of shares.

    "title": "The Exploitation of Relationships in Financial Distress: The Case of Trade Credit",
    "abstract": "This paper develops optimal pricing, lending, and renegotiation strategies for com- \npanies in relationships where one firm is highly dependent on the other. Long-term \ntrade-creditor firm relationships induce dependent trade creditors to grant more \nconcessions in debt renegotiations than nondependent creditors. Anticipating these \nlarger renegotiation concessions, not only do less financially stable firms prefer \ntrade credit, but all firms agree to pay a higher interest rate for trade credit. The \nmodel also explains the existence of \"teaser\" interest rates and convenience classes. \nFindings are consistent with those of the relationship-lending literature. \nTRADE CREDIT IS THE LARGEST SOURCE of short-term financing for American cor- \nporations. In 1993, trade creditors extended almost $1.5 trillion in credit to \ntheir customers. In the same year, the Internal Revenue Service (1997) es- \ntimates that for every dollar in short-term financing provided by credit mar- \nkets, $1.94 in trade credit was outstanding. Most firms extensively use trade \ncredit despite its apparent greater cost, and trade credit interest rates com- \nmonly exceed 18 percent. Petersen and Rajan (1994, 1995) posit that firms \ntake trade credit when cheaper sources of financing have been exhausted; \nhowever, this does not explain why firms with financial slack use trade \ncredit. \nThis paper provides a rationale for trade credit use by analyzing the effect \nof bilateral relationships on debt renegotiation.

In this setting, the central bank gradually impounds changes in its target into\nthe policy rate. Such gradualism represents an attempt to not spook the bond mar-\nket. However, this effort is partially undone in equilibrium, as markets rationally\nreact more to a given move when the central bank moves more gradually.

More precisely, we \nare interested in the power of trading volume in predicting the direction of \nfuture price movements. We find that individual stocks whose trading ac- \ntivity is unusually large (small) over periods of a day or a week, as measured \nby trading volume during those periods, tend to experience large (small) \nreturns over the subsequent month.

However, we find that repurchasing firms experience a significant\nreduction in systematic risk and cost of capital relative to non-repurchasing firms.\nFurther, consistent with the free cash-flow hypothesis, we find that the market reac-\ntion to share repurchase announcements is more positive among those firms that are\nmore likely to overinvest. Finally, we find evidence to indicate that investors under-\nreact to repurchase announcements because they initially underestimate the decline\nin cost of capital.\nIN RECENT YEARS OPEN-MARKET share repurchase programs have become an impor-\ntant payout method for many U.S. firms. According to data from COMPUSTAT,\nbetween 1984 and 2000 corporations spent approximately 26 percent of their\ntotal annual earnings on repurchases. Over 90 percent of these repurchases\nwere open-market repurchase programs. Also, in 1999 and 2000, for the first\ntime in history, industrial corporations spent more money on share repurchases\nthan they did on dividends. Our objective in this paper is to better understand\nthe economic motivations behind the decision to repurchase shares.\nTwo major reasons for repurchasing shares are analyzed in the theoretical\nliterature. The first is that management uses open-market share repurchases\nto signal better prospects (Bhattacharya (1979), Miller ",

    "abstract": "A number of firms in the United Kingdom list without issuing equity and then issue\nequity shortly thereafter. We argue that this two-stage offering strategy is less costly\nthan an initial public offering (IPO) because trading reduces the valuation uncertainty\nof these firms before they issue equity. We find that initial returns are 10% to 30%\nlower for these firms than for comparable IPOs, and we provide evidence that the\nmarket in the firm’s shares lowers financing costs. We also show that these firms\ntime the market both when they list and when they issue equity.\nONE TYPICAL FEATURE OF AN INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING is that the firm lists and issues\nequity simultaneously. As such, the value of the shares sold is inherently subject\nto great uncertainty, which results in underpricing. Rock (1986) argues that if\nboth informed and uninformed investors are to purchase shares in the IPO, un-\nderpricing is necessary to attract uninformed investors. Similarly, Benveniste\nand Spindt (1989) argue that if some investors have better information about\nthe value of the shares than the underwriter, the underwriter can extract this\ninformation by rewarding informed investors with underpriced shares. No mat-\nter who benefits from an informational advantage, however, the IPO literature\nagrees that uncertainty is costly for issuers.\nTo reduce valuation uncertainty, a natural solution for firms wishing to raise\nequity is to proceed in two stages, listing and letting develop a public market\nin the ",

    "abstract": "We model the widespread failure of contracts to share risk using available indices.\nA borrower and lender can share risk by conditioning repayments on an index. The\nlender has private information about the ability of this index to measure the true state\nthat the borrower would like to hedge. The lender is risk-averse and thus requires a\npremium to insure the borrower. The borrower, however, might be paying something\nfor nothing if the index is a poor measure of the true state. We provide sufﬁcient\nconditions for this effect to cause the borrower to choose a nonindexed contract instead.\nA CENTRAL IMPLICATION OF THE LITERATURE on ﬁnancial contracting is that agents\nshould structure contracts to share risk as efﬁciently as possible. In many ﬁ-\nnancial markets, standard contracts are simple and do not include risk-sharing\narrangements that condition payments on publicly available indices. A leading\nexample of this phenomenon is the mortgage market. In this market, home-\nowners are exposed to the risk that their homes will decline in value. Lenders\nare arguably better equipped to bear this risk and could insulate homeowners\nagainst declines in house prices by making mortgage repayment terms con-\ntingent on a house-price index.

Two possible explanations are “public care\naversion” (PCA), retiree aversion to simultaneously running out of wealth and being\nin need of long-term care, and an intentional bequest motive. To disentangle the\nrelative importance of PCA and bequest motive, we estimate a structural model of\nthe retirement phase using a novel survey instrument that includes hypothetical\nquestions. We identify PCA as very signiﬁcant and ﬁnd bequest motives that spread\ndeep into the middle class. Our results highlight potential interest in annuities that\nmake allowance for long-term care expenses.\nIN A WORLD without bequest motives and with complete markets, a household\nshould fully annuitize and consume all wealth before death (Yaari (1965)). In\nreality, Dynan, Skinner, and Zeldes (2004) and De Nardi, French, and Jones\n(2010) show that assets of the old decrease slowly if at all, and many die with\nsigniﬁcant wealth in the form of housing equity and liquid assets.

I argue that country attributes are still critical to financial decision-making\nbecause of “twin agency problems” that arise because rulers of sovereign states and\ncorporate insiders pursue their own interests at the expense of outside investors. When\nthese twin agency problems are significant, diffuse ownership is inefficient and cor-\nporate insiders must co-invest with other investors, retaining substantial equity. The\nresulting ownership concentration limits economic growth, financial development,\nand the ability of a country to take advantage of financial globalization.\nAT THE END OF WORLD WAR II, the financial markets of most countries were\nclosed to cross-border trade in financial assets. Since then, many countries have\nsharply reduced such barriers.

    "abstract": "Many models use noise trader risk and corresponding violations of the Law of One\nPrice to explain pricing anomalies, but include a storage technology in perfectly elas-\ntic supply or unlimited asset liability. Storage allows aggregate consumption risk to\ndiffer from exogenous fundamental risk, but using aggregate consumption as a factor\nfor asset returns can make noise trader risk superfluous. Using (i) limited asset lia-\nbility and limited storage withdrawals, or (ii) an endogenous locally riskless interest\nrate eliminates violations of the Law of One Price. Our main results use only budget\nequations and market clearing, and require virtually no assumptions about behavior.\nTHE IDEA THAT REAL -WORLD INVESTORS MAY NOT BE fully rational is an important\ninfluence on studies of modern asset pricing. Models of investor behavior natu-\nrally emphasize assumptions about investor rationality, but also embedded into\nthese models are budget constraints, market clearing, the absence of single-\nperiod arbitrage opportunities, and assumptions about asset liability. We show\nthat these features limit the impact of investor behavior on asset prices except in\nimplausible circumstances. Common assumptions in the literature often thwart\nthese limits and therefore yield misleading economic intuition. Thus, while in-\nvestor behavior can be important for asset pricing, it is important only in a\nmanner different from that portrayed by models with these assumptions.\nWe make this point by dissecting t",

However, we find negative\nabnormal returns on the magnitude of 10 to 14 percent in the first year following\ndowngrades. Additional results reveal that this underperformance is especially pro-\nnounced for small, low-credit-quality firms. Also, downgrades underperform in nearly\nall years in the sample, and a large part of the abnormal returns occur at sub-\nsequent earnings announcements. Thus, the evidence suggests that the poor re-\nturns result from an underreaction to the announcement of downgrades, rather\nthan from lower systematic risk.\nA NUMBER OF RECENT STUDIES suggest that stock price reactions to various\nevents are often incomplete.

Despite size differences in sample stocks, there is a surprising \nconsistency to their trading. One dealer tends to dominate trading in a stock. Mar- \nkets are concentrated and spreads are increasing in the volume and market share \nof the dominant dealer. Entry and exit are ubiquitous. Exiting dealers are those \nwith very low profits and trading volume. Entering market makers fail to capture \na meaningful share of trading or profits. Thus, free entry does little to improve the \ncompetitive nature of the market as entering dealers have little impact.

There is an active market for corpo-\nrate assets, with close to seven percent of plants changing ownership annually\nthrough mergers, acquisitions, and asset sales in peak expansion years. The prob-\nability of asset sales and whole-firm transactions is related to firm organization\nand ex ante efficiency of buyers and sellers.

We first show that high market-to-book acquirers\ntypically do not purchase low market-to-book targets. Instead, mergers pair together\nfirms with similar ratios. We then build a continuous-time model of investment and\nmerger activity combining search, scarcity, and asset complementarity to explain this\nlike buys like result. We test the model by relating like-buys-like to search frictions.\nSearch frictions and assortative matching vary inversely, supporting the model over\nstandard explanations.\nTHE BOUNDARIES OF THE FIRM are constantly being drawn and redrawn in the\nmarket for corporate control. This activity surely reflects the importance of the\nplacement of the boundaries of the firm, a topic that has received a great deal of\nattention in economic theory. The goal of this paper is to bridge the gap between\nthe theory of the firm and empirical evidence on mergers, and demonstrate the\nsignificance of the theory of the firm for understanding empirical regularities\nin the market for mergers and acquisitions.\nOne of the most well-established stylized facts about merger and acquisi-\ntion activity is that the typical merger involves an acquirer with high asset\nvaluations purchasing a target with low asset valuations. This is commonly\ninterpreted as evidence in favor of a “q-theory of mergers,” in which mergers\ninvolve redeploying the assets of underperforming tar",

    "abstract": "Why do some ﬁrms, especially ﬁnancial institutions, ﬁnance themselves so short-\nterm? We show that extreme reliance on short-term ﬁnancing may be the outcome of\na maturity rat race: a borrower may have an incentive to shorten the maturity of an\nindividual creditor’s debt contract because this dilutes other creditors. In response,\nother creditors opt for shorter maturity contracts as well. This dynamic toward short\nmaturities is present whenever interim information is mostly about the probability\nof default rather than the recovery in default. For borrowers that cannot commit to a\nmaturity structure, equilibrium ﬁnancing is inefﬁciently short-term.\nONE OF THE CENTRAL lessons of the ﬁnancial crisis of 2007–2009 is the impor-\ntance of maturity structure for ﬁnancial stability: the crisis vividly exposed\nthe vulnerability of institutions with strong maturity mismatch—those who\nﬁnance themselves short-term and invest long-term—to disruptions in their\nfunding liquidity. This raises the question of why ﬁrms and, in particular, ﬁ-\nnancial institutions, use so much short-term ﬁnancing, even if this exposes\nthem to signiﬁcant rollover risk?\nIn this paper, we argue that excessive reliance on short-term ﬁnancing may\nbe the outcome of an inefﬁcient dynamic that we call thematurity rat race.\nTo demonstrate this point, we develop a model of the equilibrium maturity\nstructure for a borrower who borrows from multiple creditors to ﬁnance long-\nterm investments.

I inves-\ntigate their causal impact on trading and price formation by examining national\nnewspaper strikes in several countries. Trading volume falls 12% on strike days. The\ndispersion of stock returns and their intraday volatility are reduced by 7%, while ag-\ngregate returns are unaffected. Moreover, analysis of return predictability indicates\nthat newspapers propagate news from the previous day. These ﬁndings demonstrate\nthat the media contribute to the efﬁciency of the stock market by improving the\ndissemination of information among investors and its incorporation into stock prices.\nHOW TRADERS OBTAIN INFORMATION IS of great importance to understanding ﬁ-\nnancial markets. This paper investigates the contribution of the media, if any,\nto trading activity and price formation. In textbook ﬁnancial markets, arbi-\ntrage renders this contribution insigniﬁcant: public news is incorporated into\nasset prices quickly and fully, even before the media have time to report it.

The time period spanned allows a broader study not only of the disciplinary role\nof the takeover market in general, but also of the interaction between the takeover\nmarket and alternative governance mechanisms during the 1980s and 1990s. Overall,\nour evidence is consistent with the view of the corporate takeover market as a “court of\nlast resort,” that is, it is an external source of discipline that intercedes when internal\ncontrol mechanisms are relatively weak or ineffective.\nFINANCIAL ECONOMISTS GENERALLY AGREE WITH the proposition that takeovers occur\nin part to replace managers who are not maximizing shareholder wealth (see,\ne.g., Jensen (1988), Scharfstein (1988), and Weisbach (1993)).

I also look at implications for ﬁnancial policy.\nTHEORIES OF OPTIMAL capital structure typically explain companies’ choice of\ndebt versus equity ﬁnancing by a trade-off: ﬁrms choose a leverage ratio that\noptimally weighs the beneﬁts of debt such as interest tax shields (Kraus and\nLitzenberger (1973)) and agency beneﬁts due to reductions in free cash ﬂow\n(Jensen (1986)) against the costs of debt, which include the direct costs of\nbankruptcy (Warner (1977) and Weiss (1990)) as well as indirect costs such as\ndebt overhang (Myers (1977)), asset substitution (Jensen and Meckling (1976)),\nand asset ﬁre-sales (Shleifer and Vishny (1992)).

This creates an\nadverse selection problem, decreasing the supply of high-quality assets, and lowering\nvaluations by nonspecialist (uninformed) investors, who become unwilling to sup-\nply capital to support the price. In normal times, arbitrage capital can “multiply”\nitself by making uninformed capital function as informed capital, but in a crisis, this\nstabilizing mechanism fails.\nIN A FIRE SALE, SELLERS ARE FORCED TO SELLassets at deep discounts because no\none is willing to buy them at fair prices.

The price impact\nof irrational traders does not rely on their long-run survival, and they can have a\nsignificant impact on asset prices even when their wealth becomes negligible. We also\nshow that irrational traders’ portfolio policies can deviate from their limits long after\nthe price process approaches its long-run limit.\nMOST NEOCLASSICAL ASSET PRICING MODELS RELY on the assumption that market\nparticipants (traders) are rational in the sense that they behave in ways that\nare consistent with the objective probabilities of the states of the economy (e.g.,\nRadner (1972) and Lucas (1978)).

These results are at odds with extant ex-\nplanations of the effects of index changes that imply a symmetric price response to\nadditions and deletions.

    "abstract": "Using mutual fund redemptions as an instrument for price changes, we identify a\nstrong effect of market prices on takeover activity (the “trigger effect”). An interquar-\ntile decrease in valuation leads to a seven percentage point increase in acquisition\nlikelihood, relative to a 6% unconditional takeover probability. Instrumentation ad-\ndresses the fact that prices are endogenous and increase in anticipation of a takeover\n(the “anticipation effect”). Our results overturn prior literature that ﬁnds a weak\nrelation between prices and takeovers without instrumentation. These ﬁndings im-\nply that ﬁnancial markets have real effects: They impose discipline on managers by\ntriggering takeover threats.\nDOES A LOW MARKET valuation make a ﬁrm a takeover target? In theory, if acqui-\nsition prices are related to market prices, acquirers can proﬁt from taking over a\nﬁrm whose market value is low relative to its peers—due either to mispricing or\nmismanagement—and restore it to its potential. Indeed, in practice, acquirers\nand other investors appear to track a ﬁrm’s valuation multiples for indications\non the potential for acquisition, and managers strive to maintain high market\nvaluations to prevent a hostile takeover. Understanding whether such a link\nexists is important because, if so, this would suggest that the market is not a\nsideshow, but rather exerts a powerful disciplinary effect on ﬁrm management\n(as suggested by Marris (1964), Manne (1965),a n dJensen (1993)).\nDespite the above l",

We\nuncover another puzzling fact about the market for equity mutual funds: Funds with\nworse before-fee performance charge higher fees. This negative relation between fees\nand performance is robust and can be explained as the outcome of strategic fee-setting\nby mutual funds in the presence of investors with different degrees of sensitivity to\nperformance. We also find some evidence that better fund governance may bring fees\nmore in line with performance.\nMANY STUDIES HAVE attempted to determine whether equity mutual funds are\nable to consistently earn positive risk-adjusted returns.1 Although these studies\nhave documented significant differences in risk-adjusted returns across funds,\nit became apparent early on (Sharpe (1966)) that those differences are to a large\nextent attributable to differences in fund fees. Most research on mutual funds\nhas thus been aimed at determining whether the cross-sectional variation in\nperformance that is not explained by fees can be explained by the existence\nof managers with superior stock-picking skills (see, e.g., Chevalier and Ellison\n(1999)).

We estimate this value using risk-adjusted\ndefault probabilities derived from corporate bond spreads.

We show that\nmarginal distress costs can be as large as the marginal tax benefits of debt derived\nby Graham (2000). Thus, distress risk premia can help explain why firms appear to\nuse debt conservatively.\nFINANCIAL DISTRESS HAS BOTH DIRECT AND INDIRECT COSTS (Warner (1977), Altman\n(1984), Franks and Touros (1989), Weiss (1990), Asquith, Gertner, and Scharf-\nstein (1994), Opler and Titman (1994), Sharpe (1994), Denis and Denis (1995),\nGilson (1997), Andrade and Kaplan (1998), Maksimovic and Phillips (1998)).\nWhether such costs are high enough to matter for corporate valuation practice\nand capital structure decisions is the subject of much debate.

Amidst liquid-\nity deterioration, the presence of government bailout helps alleviate the heightened\nliquidity-driven default, making SOE bonds more valuable and widening the SOE\npremium.

Second, I specify and estimate a nonparamet-\nric jump-diffusion model. Results indicate that jumps play an important statistical\nrole. Estimates of jump times and sizes indicate that unexpected news about the\nmacroeconomy generates the jumps. Finally, I investigate the pricing implications of\njumps.

Un-\nemployment news bundles three types of primitive information relevant for valuing\nstocks: information about future interest rates, the equity risk premium, and corpo-\nrate earnings and dividends. The nature of the information bundle, and hence the\nrelative importance of the three effects, changes over time depending on the state of\nthe economy.

The particular news event we consider is the Bureau\nof Labor Statistic’s (BLS) monthly announcement of the unemployment rate.\nWe establish that the stock market’s response to unemployment news arrival\ndepends on whether the economy is expanding or contracting.

By linking risk and expected returns to eco-\nnomic primitives, such as tastes and technology, my model generates many empirical\nregularities in the cross-section of returns; it also yields an array of new refutable\nhypotheses providing fresh directions for future empirical research.\nWHY DO VALUE STOCKS EARN HIGHER EXPECTED RETURNS than growth stocks? This ap-\npears to be a troublesome anomaly for rational expectations, because according\nto conventional wisdom, growth options hinge upon future economic conditions\nand must be riskier than assets in place. In a widely used corporate finance\ntextbook, Grinblatt and Titman (2001, p. 392) contend that “Growth opportuni-\nties are usually the source of high betas,..., because growth options tend to be\nmost valuable in good times and have implicit leverage, which tends to increase\nbeta, they contain a great deal of systematic risk.” Gomes, Kogan, and Zhang\n(2003) also predict that growth options are always riskier than assets in place,\nas these options are “leveraged” on existing assets.

    "abstract": "Data on corporate governance and disclosure practices reveal wide within-country\nvariation that decreases with the strength of investors’ legal protection. A simple\nmodel identifies three firm attributes related to that variation: investment oppor-\ntunities, external financing, and ownership structure. Using firm-level governance\nand transparency data from 27 countries, we find that all three firm attributes are\nrelated to the quality of governance and disclosure practices, and firms with higher\ngovernance and transparency rankings are valued higher in stock markets. All rela-\ntions are stronger in less investor-friendly countries, demonstrating that firms adapt\nto poor legal environments to establish efficient governance practices.\nPREVIOUS STUDIES SHOW THAT BETTER LEGAL PROTECTION for investors is associated\nwith higher valuation of the stock market (La Porta et al. (2002)), higher\nvaluation of listed firms relative to their assets or changes in investments\n(Wurgler (2000)), and larger listed firms in terms of their sales and assets\n(Kumar, Rajan, and Zingales (1999)). Furthermore, industries and firms in\nbetter legal regimes rely more on external financing to fund their growth\n∗Durnev is with University of Miami Business School and Kim is with the University of\nMichigan Business School, Ann Arbor.

For firms in poorly developed financial markets, implicit \nborrowing in the form of trade credit may provide an alternative source of \nfunds. We show that industries with higher dependence on trade credit finan- \ncing exhibit higher rates of growth in countries with weaker financial institu- \ntions. Furthermore, consistent with barriers to trade credit access among \nyoung firms, we show that most of the effect that we report comes from growth \nin the size of preexisting firms. \nIN RECENT YEARS, there has been increasing interest in the economics literature in \nthe role of financial intermediaries in promoting economic growth. Recent pa- \npers have shown that improved financial market development is associated with \ngrowth, using a variety of methodologies and data sets.1 One of the basic explana- \ntions for this pattern is that the financial sector serves to reallocate funds from \nthose with an excess of capital, given their investment opportunities, to those \nwith a shortage of funds (relative to opportunities). Thus, an economy with well- \ndeveloped financial institutions will be better able to allocate resources to \nprojects that yield the highest returns. \nThis allocative role of financial institutions in promoting development was the \nfocus of Rajan and Zingales (1998), who found that industrial s",

Countries that are more central in the global trade network have lower interest\nrates and currency risk premia. To explain these ﬁndings, I present a general equi-\nlibrium model in which central countries’ consumption growth is more exposed to\nglobal consumption growth shocks. This causes the currencies of central countries to\nappreciate in bad times, resulting in lower interest rates and currency risk premia.\nEmpirically, central countries’ consumption growth covaries more with world con-\nsumption growth, further validating the proposed mechanism.\nBETWEEN 2001 AND 2016, CARRY TRADE INVESTORS that went long in currencies\nwith high average interest rates, by borrowing in currencies with low average\ninterest rates, obtained an annualized Sharpe ratio of 0.43.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates trading volume before scheduled and unscheduled corporate\nannouncements to explore how traders respond to private information. I show that\ncumulative trading volume decreases inversely to information asymmetry prior to\nscheduled announcements, while the opposite relation holds for volume after the\nannouncement. In contrast, trading volume before unscheduled announcements in-\ncreases dramatically and shows little relation to proxies for information asymmetry. I\ninvestigate the behavior of market makers and find that they act appropriately by in-\ncreasing price sensitivity before all announcements, implying that they extract timing\ninformation from their order books.\nTRADING VOLUME PLAYS a critical role in financial markets. It facilitates the price\ndiscovery process, enables investors to share financial risks, and ensures that\ncorporations can raise funds needed for investment. Trading volume is gen-\nerally characterized as either informed or uninformed (liquidity trading). Al-\nthough both types of trading volume are studied in the finance literature,\n1 their\nrelative importance remains poorly understood. In this paper, I study trading\nvolume prior to important corporate announcements, when information asym-\nmetry\n2 is likely to be the greatest.

    "abstract": "We derive an intertemporal asset pricing model and explore its implications for trading\nvolume and asset returns. We show that investors trade in only two portfolios: the\nmarket portfolio, and a hedging portfolio that is used to hedge the risk of changing\nmarket conditions. We empirically identify the hedging portfolio using weekly volume\nand returns data for U.S. stocks, and then test two of its properties implied by the\ntheory: Its return should be an additional risk factor in explaining the cross section\nof asset returns, and should also be the best predictor of future market returns.\nFUNDAMENTAL SHOCKS TO THE ECONOMY DRIVE BOTH THE SUPPLY and demand of finan-\ncial assets and their prices. Therefore, any asset pricing model that attempts\nto establish a structural link between asset prices and underlying economic\nfactors also establishes links between prices and quantities such as trading\nvolume since economic fundamentals such as the investors’ preferences and\nthe assets’ future payoffs determine the joint behavior of prices and quanti-\nties.\n1 The construction and empirical implementation of any asset pricing model\nshould therefore involve both price and quantity as key elements. Indeed, from\na purely empirical perspective, the joint behavior of price and quantity reveals\nmore information about the relation between asset prices and economic factors\nthan do prices alone.

We examine this\nquestion by constructing new measures of transparency and by making use of a unique\nmicrodata set on portfolio holdings of emerging market funds around the world. We\ndistinguish between government and corporate transparency. There is clear evidence\nthat funds systematically invest less in less transparent countries. Moreover, funds\nhave a greater propensity to exit nontransparent countries during crises.\nTHE MERITS OF TRANSPARENCY HAVE RECENTLY been emphasized in the context of\nboth corporate and government policies. In policy circles, transparency is seen\nas a way for countries to attract capital, reduce capital market volatility, and\nlessen the severity of financial crises. For example, it has been argued that\nduring volatile times, international investors may be more likely to rush in\nand out of opaque countries (see International Monetary Fund (2001)). In the\ncorporate finance context, there is a new literature emphasizing how earn-\nings opacity affects equity returns (see, e.g., Bhattacharya, Daouk, and Welker\n(2003)). There is also some evidence that cross-country differences in corporate\ngovernance may be related to economy wide outcomes during financial market\ncrises (Johnson et al.

Thus, the reg-\nulator optimally increases transparency during crises. Under this policy, however,\ninformation disclosure signals a deterioration of economic fundamentals, which gives\nthe regulator ex post incentives to withhold information. This commitment problem\nprecludes a disclosure policy that provides ex ante optimal insurance against aggre-\ngate shocks, and can result in excess opacity that increases the likelihood of a systemic\ncrisis.\nFINANCIAL CRISES ARE OFTEN associated with demands for an increase in the\ntransparency of the ﬁnancial system. Following the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis, reg-\nulators have periodically performed and disclosed stress tests on the largest\nﬁnancial institutions.

These results raise concerns about the evolving nature of Treasury mar-\nkets and suggest that investors may now place less weight on the traditional role of\nTreasury securities as liquid trading vehicles. These stylized facts provide empirical\nbenchmarks that could help guide future theoretical and empirical work about the\neconomics of safe assets in ﬁnancial markets.\nONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT issues in asset pricing is whether investors\nshould be willing to pay a premium above intrinsic fair value for Treasury\nsecurities because of their money-like characteristics. This type of premium is\noften called a convenience premium in the literature and is widely known as\nTreasury “richness” by market participants. A Treasury security is said to be\nrich/cheap if its convenience premium is positive/negative.\nAn extensive theoretical literature focuses on convenience premia in Trea-\nsury markets. This literature can be divided into two contrasting streams.\nThe ﬁrst seeks to explain why Treasuries are rich, while the second seeks\nto explain why some Treasuries are cheap. On the one hand, the safe-asset\nliterature argues that investors may pay a premium for Treasury securities\nbecause of the safety and liquidity Treasuries provide.1",

The\nperception of this risk is a function of the objective characteristics of the stocks and\nthe subjective characteristics of the investor.

In Dutch and Italian\nmicro data, as well as in cross-country data, we find evidence consistent with lack of\ntrust being an important factor in explaining the limited participation puzzle.\nTHE DECISION TO INVEST IN stocks requires not only an assessment of the risk–\nreturn trade-off given the existing data, but also an act of faith (trust) that the\ndata in our possession are reliable and that the overall system is fair.

    "abstract": "There is ongoing debate about the apparent weak or negative relation between risk\n(conditional variance) and expected returns in the aggregate stock market. We de-\nvelop and estimate an empirical model based on the intertemporal capital asset pric-\ning model (ICAPM) that separately identifies the two components of expected returns,\nnamely, the risk component and the component due to the desire to hedge changes in\ninvestment opportunities. The estimated coefficient of relative risk aversion is posi-\ntive, statistically significant, and reasonable in magnitude. However, expected returns\nare driven primarily by the hedge component. The omission of this component is partly\nresponsible for the existing contradictory results.\nTHE RETURN ON THE MARKET PORTFOLIO plays a central role in the capital asset\npricing model (CAPM), the financial theory widely used by both academics and\npractitioners. However, the intertemporal properties of stock market returns\nare not yet fully understood.\n1 In particular, there is ongoing debate in the liter-\nature about the relation between stock market risk and return, and the extent\nto which stock market volatility moves stock prices. This paper provides new\nevidence on the risk–return relation by estimating a variant of Merton’s (1973)\nintertemporal capital asset pricing model (ICAPM).\nIn his seminal paper, Merton (1973) shows that the conditional excess market\nreturn, E\nt−1rM,t − rf,t−1, is a linear function of its conditional variance, σ2\nM,t−1,\n(th",

However, this long-term abnormal\nperformance is driven by the post-earnings-announcement drift. After controlling for\nthe earnings performance and the skewness of buy-and-hold abnormal returns, there\nis no compelling evidence of a post-dividend-reduction or post-dividend-omission price\ndrift.\nA number of studies present evidence of long-term return anomalies following\nmajor corporate events that call into question the informational efficiency of\ncapital markets. In particular, these studies demonstrate that announcement-\nperiod abnormal stock returns for various events are not unbiased revisions\nin investors’ expectations.\n1 Fama (1998) reviews this evidence and concludes\nthat these seemingly puzzling findings are the result of chance, or incorrect\nstatistical method, or a misspecified expected return model.\n2 In particular, in\nhis review of the paper by Michaely, Thaler, and Womack (1995), who report a\nstock price underreaction in samples of 561 dividend initiation and 887 dividend\nomission announcements made over the 1964 to 1988 period, Fama contends\nthat changing the matching criteria might tell a different story, and hence he\ncalls for an out-of-sample test before drawing any inferences about long-term\nreturns following changes in dividend payments.\n∗Yi Liu is ",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates options market reaction to changes in the instantaneous \nvariance of the underlying asset. There are three main findings. First, options \nmarket investors underreact to individual daily changes in instantaneous vari- \nance.

Third, they tend to \nunderreact (overreact) to current daily changes in instantaneous variance that are \npreceded mostly by daily changes of the opposite (same) sign. The third finding can \nreconcile the first two and is also consistent with well-established cognitive biases. \nTHE EXISTENCE AND NATURE of predictable investor misreaction to information \nis a central concern of financial economists. Recently, one focus of this con- \ncern has been a body of stock market studies that can be interpreted as \nindicating that stock market investors underreact to information over short \nhorizons and overreact to information over long horizons (see Chapters 1 \nand 5 of Shleifer (2000) for a review of the stock market studies that advo- \ncates this interpretation).

In contrast, messages mentioning overdraft availability\nwithout mentioning price increase usage. Neither change persists long after the mes-\nsages stop. These results do not square easily with classical models of consumer choice\nand ﬁrm competition. Instead, they support behavioral models where consumers un-\nderestimate and are inattentive to overdraft costs, and ﬁrms respond by shrouding\noverdraft prices in equilibrium.\nMANY BUSINESS MODELS IN FINANCIAL services and other industries rely on expen-\nsive add-ons that are tied to base goods.

Furthermore, at-the-money\nstraddle hedging errors are highly correlated with cap-implied volatilities and can\nexplain a large fraction of hedging errors of all caps and straddles across moneyness\nand maturities.

I show that to separate the entrepreneur's value of control from the firm's \nexpected payoff, the venture capitalist demands disproportionately higher control \nrights than the size of his equity investment.

Reversing the regressions mitigates bias and facilitates the use of \nmarket information to control for differences in risk and expected growth.

This finding is interesting for two reasons, neither\nof which is a priori obvious. First, it adds further support to the view that firm-specific\nreturn variation gauges the extent to which information about the firm is quickly and\naccurately reflected in share prices. Second, it can be interpreted as evidence that\nmore informative stock prices facilitate more efficient corporate investment.\nCORPORATE CAPITAL INVESTMENT should be more efficient where stock prices are\nmore informative. Informed stock prices convey meaningful signals to manage-\nment about the quality of their decisions. They also convey meaningful signals\nto the financial markets about the need to intervene when management de-\ncisions are poor. Corporate governance mechanisms, such as shareholder law-\nsuits, executive options, institutional investor pressure, and the market for\ncorporate control, depend on stock prices. Where stock prices are more infor-\nmative, these mechanisms induce better corporate governance—which includes\nmore efficient capital investment decisions.\nOur objective in this paper is to examine empirically whether capital invest-\nment decisions are indeed more efficient where stock prices are more informa-\ntive.

    "abstract": "We develop and test a theory explaining the equilibrium matching of issuers and un-\nderwriters. We assume that issuers and underwriters associate by mutual choice, and\nthat underwriter ability and issuer quality are complementary. Our model implies\nthat matching is positive assortative, and that matches are based on firms’ and un-\nderwriters’ relative characteristics at the time of issuance. The model predicts that\nthe market share of top underwriters and their average issue quality varies inversely\nwith issuance volume. Various cross-sectional patterns in underwriting spreads are\nconsistent with equilibrium matching. We find strong empirical confirmation of our\ntheory.\nONCE A FIRM DECIDES to issue equity in the public market, it must next decide\nwhich underwriter to employ for the offering. And underwriters, faced with a\nvariety of opportunities to provide their services, must decide which issuers to\nserve. In this paper, we develop a theory that explains the equilibrium asso-\nciation of issuing firms and underwriters and produces a rich set of testable\nempirical implications. Examining the empirical evidence, we find strong sup-\nport for our theory.\nOur theoretical setup is based on the idea that issuing firms and underwrit-\ners associate by mutual choice.

    "abstract": "The Homeland Investment Act provided a tax holiday for the repatriation of foreign\nearnings.

This paper shows that\nrepatriations did not increase domestic investment, employment, or R&D—even for\nﬁrms that appeared to be ﬁnancially constrained or lobbied for the holiday. Instead,\na $1 increase in repatriations was associated with a $0.60 to $0.92 increase in share-\nholder payouts. Regulations intended to restrict such payouts were undermined by\nthe fungibility of money. Results indicate that U.S. multinationals were not ﬁnancially\nconstrained and were well-governed.\nTHE HOMELAND INVESTMENT ACT(HIA), passed in 2004 as part of the American\nJobs Creation Act (AJCA), provided for a one-time tax holiday on the repa-\ntriation of foreign earnings by U.S.-based multinational enterprises (MNEs).\nMembers of Congress argued that the HIA would create more than 500,000\njobs over two years by raising investment in the United States.

    "abstract": "Acquiring-firm shareholders lost 12 cents around acquisition announcements per\ndollar spent on acquisitions for a total loss of $240 billion from 1998 through 2001,\nwhereas they lost $7 billion in all of the 1980s, or 1.6 cents per dollar spent. The 1998\nto 2001 aggregate dollar loss of acquiring-firm shareholders is so large because of a\nsmall number of acquisitions with negative synergy gains by firms with extremely\nhigh valuations. Without these acquisitions, the wealth of acquiring-firm sharehold-\ners would have increased. Firms that make these acquisitions with large dollar losses\nperform poorly afterward.\nIN THIS PAPER , WE EXAMINE THE EXPERIENCE of acquiring-firm shareholders in the\nrecent merger wave and compare it to their experience in the merger wave of\nthe 1980s. Such an investigation is important because the recent merger wave\nis the largest by far in American history. It is associated with higher stock\nvaluations, greater use of equity as a form of payment for transactions, and\nmore takeover defenses in place than the merger wave of the 1980s.\n1 Though\nthese differences suggest poorer returns for acquiring-firm shareholders, there\nare also several reasons why the acquiring-firm shareholders may have better\nreturns.

To examine\nwhether wealth is likely to proxy for power, I use lagged wealth (typically measured\nbefore the CEO was hired), and the results remain for one of two incentive measures.\nAlso, the wealth–incentive result is not stronger for CEOs likely to face limited owner\noversight. Finally, wealth is unrelated to pay levels, and is hence unlikely to proxy for\nskill.\nTHE COMPENSATION OF CHIEF EXECUTIVES of large listed companies is often largely\nin the form of risky instruments such as shares and options.

Common patterns emerge across the ﬁve factor portfolios and their mean-\nvariance efﬁcient (MVE) combination. Whereas discount rate news predominates in\nmarket returns, systematic cash ﬂow news drives the returns of anomaly portfolios\nand their MVE combination with the market portfolio. Anomaly cash ﬂow and dis-\ncount rate shocks are largely uncorrelated with market cash ﬂow and discount rate\nshocks and with business cycle ﬂuctuations. These rich empirical patterns restrict the\njoint dynamics of ﬁrm cash ﬂows and the pricing kernel, thereby informing models of\nstocks’ expected returns.\nOVER THE PAST 30 YEARS, researchers have uncovered robust patterns in stock\nreturns that contradict classic asset pricing theories. A prominent example is\nthat value stocks outperform growth stocks, even though they are similarly\nexposed to ﬂuctuations in the overall stock market.

We find that, on average, a hypothetical\nunanticipated 25-basis-point cut in the Federal funds rate target is associated with\nabout a 1% increase in broad stock indexes. Adapting a methodology due to Camp-\nbell and Ammer, we find that the effects of unanticipated monetary policy actions on\nexpected excess returns account for the largest part of the response of stock prices.\nTHE ULTIMATE OBJECTIVES OF MONETARY POLICY are expressed in terms of macroe-\nconomic variables such as output, employment, and inflation. However, the\ninfluence of monetary policy instruments on these variables is at best indi-\nrect. The most direct and immediate effects of monetary policy actions, such\nas changes in the Federal funds rate, are on the financial markets; by affect-\ning asset prices and returns, policymakers try to modify economic behavior in\nways that will help to achieve their ultimate objectives. Understanding the\nlinks between monetary policy and asset prices is thus crucially important for\nunderstanding the policy transmission mechanism.\nThis paper is an empirical study of the relationship between monetary pol-\nicy and one of the most important financial markets, the market for equities.\nAccording to the conventional wisdom, changes in monetary policy are trans-\nmitted thro",

With this data set, we \nemploy Logit regressions to identify the determinants of buying and selling activ- \nity over a two-year period. We find evidence that investors are reluctant to realize \nlosses, that they engage in tax-loss selling activity, and that past returns and his- \ntorical price patterns, such as being at a monthly high or low, affect trading. There \nalso is modest evidence that life-cycle trading plays a role in the pattern of buys \nand sells. \nTHE EXTRAORDINARY DEGREE OF TRADING ACTIVITY in financial markets repre- \nsents one of the great challenges to the field of finance. Many theoretical \nmodels in finance, such as those found in Aumann (1976) and Milgrom and \nStokey (1982), argue that there should be no trade at all.

To \naddress the puzzle of why so much trading occurs, it would be useful to \nunderstand what motivates trades and whether such motivations are rooted \nin behavioral hypotheses, such as an aversion to realizing losses, a mis- \nguided belief in contrarianism or momentum that might be evidence of over- \nconfidence (see, e.g., Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam (1998)), or a \nlove of gambling.

    "abstract": "Using laboratory experiments, we provide evidence on three factors inﬂuencing trader\nperformance: ﬂuid intelligence, cognitive reﬂection, and theory of mind (ToM). Fluid\nintelligence provides traders with computational skills necessary to draw a statisti-\ncal inference. Cognitive reﬂection helps traders avoid behavioral biases and thereby\nextract signals from market orders and update their prior beliefs accordingly. ToM\ndescribes the degree to which traders correctly assess the informational content of or-\nders. We show that cognitive reﬂection and ToM are complementary because traders\nbeneﬁt from understanding signals’ quality only if they are capable of processing\nthese signals.\nTHE CORNERSTONE MODELS OF FINANCEbuild on the assumption that a represen-\ntative economic agent acts rationally (e.g., Markowitz (1952), Sharpe (1964),\nSamuelson (1970)).

We show that these prices \nconverge to zero at speeds that depend upon whether the underlying asset \nprice process is purely continuous, purely discontinuous, or a combination of \nboth. We apply the method to S&P 500 index options and find the existence of \nboth a continuous component and a jump component in the index. \nTo effectively price or hedge derivative securities, or to understand the behavior \nof financial asset prices in general, it is important to know if they are best mod- \neled using a purely continuous process (PC), a pure jump process (PJ), or a combi- \nnation of both (CJ).

Although the trading \nactivity of the Jardine Group moved to Singapore, the core businesses re- \nmained in Hong Kong and Mainland China. Evidence indicates the Jardine \nstocks are correlated less (more) with the Hong Kong (Singapore) market after \nthe delisting. This result cannot be explained by various hypotheses, such as \nrelocation of core business, time-varying betas, migration of trading activity, \nand currency and tax distortions.

Odd lots are increasingly used in\nalgorithmic and high-frequency trading, but are not reported to the consolidated\ntape or in databases such as TAQ. In our sample, the median number of odd-lot\ntrades is 24% but in some stocks odd lots are 60% or more of trading. Odd-lot trades\ncontribute 35% of price discovery, consistent with informed traders using odd lots\nto avoid detection.

Excluding odd lots from the\nconsolidated tape raises important regulatory issues.\nODD LOTS ARE TRADES for less than 100 shares of stock. Traditionally, odd-lot\ntrades and volumes were small, and were thought to originate from retail\ntraders and so they were viewed as having little information content with\nrespect to future price movements—that is, as irrelevant.

We compare institutions’ shareholding patterns across\ncountries and find vast differences in the extent to which they are large shareholders.\nThese variations are largely determined by macro corporate governance factors such\nas shareholder protection, law enforcement, and corporate disclosure requirements.\nThis suggests that strong governance environments act to strengthen monitoring abil-\nity such that more institutions are encouraged to hold concentrated equity positions.\nINSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENTS IN WORLD EQUITY MARKETS have grown substantially\nin recent decades. 1 While this trend has led to financial institutions becom-\ning the largest investor class in many countries, the extent to which they\nare willing to take concentrated ownership positions remains unclear. 2 From\na corporate governance perspective, analyzing concentrated shareholdings is\nimportant because they provide an incentive to monitor (Shleifer and Vishny\n(1986)).

The study is based on a complete \nsample of annual earnings announcements during the period 1988 to 1998. The \nrelative level of the market is based on the difference between the current market \nP/E and the average market P/E over the prior 12 months. We find that the stock \nprice response to negative earnings surprises increases as the relative level of the \nmarket rises. Furthermore, the difference between bad news and good news earn- \nings response coefficients rises with the market. \nONE OF THE LONGEST RUNNING empirical debates in finance regards the relative \npricing of\"value\" and \"glamour\" stocks. Beginning with early work by Basu \n(1983) and Stattman (1980), evidence has accumulated that excess returns \non value stocks-that is, the issues of companies for which the ratio of earn- \nings, cash flow, or book value per share is large relative to stock price-are \ngreater than returns on glamour stocks, for which these ratios are small. On \none side, Fama and French (1992, 1993, 1995, 1996) argue that the observed \ndifferential between the returns on value and glamour stocks represents a \nrisk premium.

We find that the lead underwriter \nis always the dominant market maker; he takes substantial inventory positions in \nthe aftermarket trading, and co-managers play a negligible role in aftermarket \ntrading. The lead underwriter engages in stabilization activity for less successful \nIPOs, and uses the overallotment option to reduce his inventory risk.

Patent filings by academics have been very infrequent, which \nappears to be a consequence of a lack of awareness or interest on the part of faculty \nmembers, rather than any fundamental unsuitability of their research for patenting. \nThe failure to cite academic research in this area appears to be problematic and \nmay reflect patent examiners' limited exposure to finance research and patents. \nPATENTS FOR FINANCIAL FORMULAS and methods, which have been awarded by \nthe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) since at least the early 1970s, \nhave become increasingly frequent in recent years. Interest in these awards \nhas surged since a 1998 decision in a lawsuit between Signature Financial \nGroup and State Street Bank, which established the patentability of finan- \ncial and other business methods.' This paper takes a comprehensive look at \nfinancial patenting, in an effort to understand this growing area of activity \nand its implications for academia. \nThe analysis proceeds in four parts.

A prevailing view\namong economists and regulators is that wholesale funding is vulnerable to\nsudden stops, or dry-ups, during which banks lose funding regardless of their\ncredit quality. Such breakdowns have major macroeconomic consequences, as\nthey may force banks to cut lending (Iyer et al. ( 2014)) and affect real out-\ncomes such as unemployment (Chodorow-Reich ( 2014)). To mitigate this con-\ncern, new regulatory liquidity ratios penalize the use of wholesale funding\n(Tarullo (2014)).\nIn this paper, we empirically investigate the determinants of the fragility of\nwholesal",

    "abstract": "I evaluate the forced CEO turnover rate and quantify effects on shareholder value\nby estimating a dynamic model. The model features learning about CEO ability and\ncostly turnover. To ﬁt the observed forced turnover rate, the model needs the average\nboard of directors to behave as if replacing the CEO costs shareholders at least $200\nmillion. This cost mainly reﬂects CEO entrenchment rather than a real cost to share-\nholders. The model predicts that shareholder value would rise 3% if we eliminated\nthis perceived turnover cost, all else equal. The model also helps explain the relation\nbetween CEO ﬁrings, tenure, and proﬁtability.\nON AVERAGE,2 % OF CEOs at large U.S. corporations are ﬁred each year (e.g.,\nHuson, Parrino, and Starks (2001), Kaplan and Minton (2006)). This rate seems\nlow, and it is tempting to conclude that CEOs are entrenched and boards of\ndirectors are not acting in shareholders’ interests. However, the literature pro-\nvides little guidance for making such judgments. For example, it is not clear\nwhat rate of forced CEO turnover we should expect from a well-functioning\nboard. It is therefore difﬁcult to judge whether the observed 2% rate is low or\nhigh. If it is indeed too low, it is not clear how much shareholder value is being\ndestroyed.\nThis paper’s goals are to provide a benchmark for the CEO ﬁring rate and\nto quantify the amount of shareholder value at stake.

A majority of these firms has insider\nownership below 20% after 10 years. Stock market performance and liquidity play an\nextremely important role in ownership dynamics.

We test the comparative static predictions of \nour model. In contrast to previous work, we find that diversification is posi- \ntively related to managerial incentives. Further, the link between firm perfor- \nmance and managerial incentives is weaker for firms that experience changes \nin diversification than it is for firms that do not.

    "abstract": "The average cash-to-assets ratio for U.S. industrial firms more than doubles from\n1980 to 2006. A measure of the economic importance of this increase is that at the\nend of the sample period, the average firm can retire all debt obligations with its cash\nholdings. Cash ratios increase because firms’ cash flows become riskier. In addition,\nfirms change: They hold fewer inventories and receivables and are increasingly R&D\nintensive. While the precautionary motive for cash holdings plays an important role\nin explaining the increase in cash ratios, we find no consistent evidence that agency\nconflicts contribute to the increase.\nCONSIDERABLE MEDIA ATTENTION has been devoted to the increase in cash holdings\nof U.S. firms. For instance, a recent article inThe Wall Street Journalstates that\n“The piles of cash and stockpile of repurchased shares at [big U.S. companies]\nhave hit record levels.”1 In this paper, we investigate how the cash holdings of\nU.S. firms have evolved since 1980 and whether this evolution can be explained\nby changes in known determinants of cash holdings.

    "abstract": "We propose a quantile-based measure of conditional skewness , particularly suitable for\nhandling recalcitrant emerging market returns. The skewne ss of international stock\nmarket returns varies signiﬁcantly across countries over t ime, and persists at long\nhorizons. In emerging markets, skewness is mostly positive and idiosyncratic, and sig-\nniﬁcantly relates to a country’s ﬁnancial and trade opennes s and balance of payments.\nIn an international portfolio setting, return asymmetry le ads to sizeable certainty-\nequivalent gains and increases the weight on emerging count ries to about 30%. In-\nvesting in emerging markets seems to be about expectations o f a higher upside than\ndownside, consistent with recent theories.\n∗Eric Ghysels is with the Department of Finance, Kenan-Flagl er Business School, and Department of Economics, Universit y\nof North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and CEPR.

    "title": "Why Is Long&#x2010;Horizon Equity Less Risky? A Duration&#x2010;Based Explanation of the Value Premium",
    "abstract": "We propose a dynamic risk-based model that captures the value premium. Firms are\nmodeled as long-lived assets distinguished by the timing of cash flows. The stochastic\ndiscount factor is specified so that shocks to aggregate dividends are priced, but shocks\nto the discount rate are not. The model implies that growth firms covary more with the\ndiscount rate than do value firms, which covary more with cash flows. When calibrated\nto explain aggregate stock market behavior, the model accounts for the observed value\npremium, the high Sharpe ratios on value firms, and the poor performance of the\nCAPM.\nTHIS PAPER PROPOSES A DYNAMIC RISK -BASED MODEL that captures both the high ex-\npected returns on value stocks relative to growth stocks, and the failure of the\ncapital asset pricing model to explain these expected returns. The value pre-\nmium, first noted by Graham and Dodd (1934), is the finding that assets with a\nhigh ratio of price to fundamentals (growth stocks) have low expected returns\nrelative to assets with a low ratio of price to fundamentals (value stocks). This\nfinding by itself is not necessarily surprising, as it is possible that the premium\non value stocks represents compensation for bearing systematic risk. However,\nFama and French (1992) and others show that the capital asset pricing model\n(CAPM) of Sharpe (1964) and Lintner (1965) cannot account for the value pre-\nmium: While the CAPM predicts that expected returns should rise with the\nbeta on the market portfolio, v",

We distinguish between firms that experienced\nrelationship termination as a consequence of bank M&As and those that did not. Our\nfindings are consistent with bank M&As having an adverse effect on credit, particu-\nlarly when the M&A is followed by relationship termination.

    "abstract": "The paper examines the decision-making, compensation, and turnover of female\nCEOs in U.S. hospitals. Contrary to the literature on lower-ranked executives and\ndirectors in public ﬁrms, there is no evidence that gender differences in preferences\nfor risk or altruism affect decision-making of hospital CEOs: corporate policies do not\nshift when women take (or leave) ofﬁce, and male and female CEOs respond similarly\nto a major ﬁnancial shock. However, female CEOs earn lower salaries, face ﬂatter\npay-for-performance incentives, and exhibit greater turnover after poor performance.\nHospital boards behave as though they perceive female CEOs as less productive.\nWOMEN MAKE UP 47% OF the U.S. labor force, yet top executive jobs are held\npredominantly by men. For example, in 2024, only 6% of S&P 500 CEOs were\nwomen. This low share is striking since women are increasingly well-educated\nand hold a growing fraction of lower-level management jobs. This paper sheds\nlight on this persistent gap by examining an important and relatively homoge-\nnous industry—the U.S. hospital sector—in which female CEOs are relatively\ncommon. The goal is to offer a comprehensive picture of the decision-making,\ncompensation, and turnover of female CEOs in a major U.S. industry over\nnearly two decades.\nThe literature suggests several possible reasons for the low share of women\namong CEOs, including gender differences, stereotypes, career interruptions,\nand institutional barriers such as lack of networks and mentor",

    "abstract": "In one of the greatest extensions of property rights in human history, common law\ncountries began giving rights to married women in the 1850s.

    "abstract": "We analyze how the work ethic of managers impacts a firm’s employment contracts,\nriskiness, growth potential, and organizational structure. Flat contracts are optimal\nfor diligent managers because they reduce risk-sharing costs, but they attract ego-\nistic agents who shirk and unskilled agents who add no value. Stable, bureaucratic\nfirms with low growth potential are more likely to gain value from managerial dili-\ngence. Firms that hire from a virtuous pool of agents are more conservative in their\ninvestments and have a horizontal corporate structure. Our theory also yields several\ntestable implications that distinguish it from standard agency models.\nEVER SINCE BERLE AND MEANS (1932) recognized that the separation of ownership\nand control impacts firm value, economists have focused on ways to mitigate\nthe agency problems that arise between shareholders and managers. Agency\ntheory is now ubiquitous in corporate finance as an important determinant of\nfirm size, capital structure, corporate governance, and firm value.\n1\nTraditionally, agency theory is founded on the principle that managers are\negoistic and must be given incentives to act in the best interests of the firm. 2\nHowever, this framework largely ignores the possibility that some managers\nare innately diligent and do not pose a moral hazard threat.

We develop a model in which ﬁrms design\ncompensation to limit the risk of such “worker runs.” To achieve cost-efﬁcient reten-\ntion, ﬁrms combine ﬁxed wages with dilutable compensation—such as vesting equity\nor bonus pools—which pays remaining workers more when others leave but gets di-\nluted otherwise.

    "abstract": "I show that households work and earn more (less) when their ﬂoating-rate mortgage\npayments quasi-exogenously increase (decrease). The response is sizable and asym-\nmetric: on average, households adjust their income by 35% of the change in their\nmortgage payment, but the response is signiﬁcantly stronger following an increase\nin payments. While men in dual-earner, childless households respond the most on\naverage, the asymmetry is most pronounced for women and young workers, who re-\nspond particularly strongly to payment increases. The asymmetry of the labor supply\nelasticity may help explain the wide range of elasticities found in previous research.\nWHEN CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES lead to changes in mortgage payments,\nhouseholds may respond by adjusting their consumption or labor supply. Ad-\njustments along either of these margins can signiﬁcantly impact the real econ-\nomy and the transmission of monetary policy (Bernanke and Gertler ( 1995),\nAdelino, Schoar, and Severino ( 2018)), but evidence regarding how consump-\ntion adjusts is much more extensive (Di Maggio et al.

By working their demands,\nlarge market order traders pool with small traders. We show that every equilibrium\non a floor exchange must involve at least partial pooling. Moreover, there is always\na fully pooling (worked order) equilibrium on a floor exchange that is equivalent to a\nblock order equilibrium in a limit order market.\nTHE GOAL OF THIS PAPER IS TO COMPARE ALTERNATIVE MARKET designs.
